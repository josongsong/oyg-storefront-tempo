        "comments": "If I would known about this serum sooner, I would've already bought one. Have a long hair and I usually wear it in the ponytail. When it's freshly washed, I have a million fly aways, and it's hard to maintain those. Was always wondering how some athletes or ice skating ladies have a nice bun and the hair on their top of their head is like glued down, doesn't move and stays flat. When I got this serum, I was curious. Tried it right away. Have to add that the tube was 90% empty and I was struggling to scrape some product on the wand. Then I started to pull the wand down from my forehead, catching every single hair, which was standing up. The serum is enriched with biotin, aloe vera and vitamins, which are acting soothing and nourishing. I was amazed by the results. No fly aways, no invisible little hairs, no more uncontrollable hair. The packaging is perfect for traveling, if we need a quick fix, even on the go. It really helps maintain my stubborn hair.",
