This one blurred by pores, didn't show my wrinkles, blotted the shine ALL day and yet didn't make my face overly dry.  The puff/sponge was an extra that I didn't know I needed until I realized how amazingly handy it was for carrying it around for quick touchups.

I have large pores thanks to genetics and oily skin, which is worsened around my large pore area, my nose and T zone in general. \n\nSo I got this seeing as it had favorable reviews and see how it would work for me and honestly, I was in love with this powder the first day I tried it. It goes on like a dream and is pleasantly smooth and silky. It coupled with my primer minimized my pores very well and after testing it for three days I am completely sold. It's held up to me working near ovens at work and me sweating as I walk out in the blistering sun. No caking or any signs of it failing. It's nice to have a finishing powder that doesn't cake because of my oils.\n\nI don't think I can recommend this enough to try.",
