It doesn't stay on, it creates a greasy, splotchy, chalky finish that does not look good. I've had drugstore foundations that look better than this.

But I noticed with the past few bottles I've purchased, it just doesn't sit right on my face. I thought it was my skin texture changing because it was settling into my fine lines, clings to dry patches, oily in some, and separates like CRAZY, where as before, it was flawless. But then I noticed everyone on here mentioning the change in formulation and it makes sense now. I'm almost due for a new bottle of foundation but unfortunately will be looking into other products because it's not worth the price anymore.",

        "comments": "I absolutely fell in love with this foundation immediately when I applied it to my wrist because it was the perfect match and I could hardly tell I had put it on. I have never been able to find a foundation that matches my skin so perfectly! So I was already amazed from that! Then when I applied it to my face I knew it would be the only foundation I'll ever use from now on! The coverage is amazing and it just matches perfectly and has a beautiful finish. I have combination skin and tend to get a little dry/flaky around my nose, forehead and chin..which causes most foundations to look pretty bad on my skin..Even with me exfoliating and keeping my face moisturized and always applying primer it always makes me feel like I shouldn't apply foundation anymore but when I tried this with a moisturizer a bit beforehand and then a primer it honestly looked amazing!! That says a lot for this foundation because I have genuinely never found a foundation that can do this and not have flaky dry spots that are pretty noticeable. I felt so good about my skin and makeup on it just gave me so much confidence and I never thought I would find a foundation that actually looked good and worked for my skin so I was really surprised by how good it looked! It has a beautiful finish and awesome coverage and looks like I'm not wearing any foundation at all! I'm so excited and grateful that I've found this and will never use any other foundation again and I'm also going to try all of the MAC products now after seeing the unbelievable results! I've always heard good things about MAC and have always wanted to try it but I felt it was too expensive for me to purchase just for it to be like all the others..but I was so wrong and a lot of people may think it's way too expensive for what it is but I promise it IS worth it!! If you are anything like me and have the same skin type I highly recommend you give this a try just make sure if you don't have oily skin to apply a moisturizer and a good primer!",

        "comments": "Edit:\nBelow was my review from applying to wearing it roughly 3hrs.\nUnfortunately hours passed that, the foundation was kind of flaking & crumbling on my skin. It almost looked like my skin was dry & that was causing the flaking but nope. I also believe this broke me out a bit. That has never happened to me. I really wanted to like this!\n\nThis foundation surprised me! I genuinely was expecting it to be more SPF feeling & smelling. It has amore of a matte finish but not restrictingly dry. \nThe formula is lightweight & easy to blend. I will say when applying, apply in the area where you're working because it does kind of set quickly. Not a bad thing just looks better on the skin. \nAt 1st I didn't like the way it looked on & around my nose but after changing the primer & setting it, it looked better. \nI do have a sensitive head, & this does have a very faint scent but idk why I still smelled it even hours later. Not my favorite...maybe applying some powder over it would help. \nI think different skin types will need different primers. As I mentioned on my nose I'm more oily but I had applied a matte primer, & it was almost flakey. A more blurring but not matte primer did the trick.",
