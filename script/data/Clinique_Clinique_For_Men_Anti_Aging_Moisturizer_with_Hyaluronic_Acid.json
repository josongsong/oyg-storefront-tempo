        "comments": "Just decided to give Clinique Men's Anti-againg face lotion a try, since my face has been dry during the winter  months and from using Proactiv plus. My three stars are for - it has only been a week and it burns my eyes. So far, these past few days from using, my skin HAS BEEN more hydrated and smooth/soft - after a month of daily evening use, I should see more result. \n\nI chose to use this lotion ONLY in the evening since it burns my eyes, making them red and watery. So I stopped applying around my eye area and use an eye cream instead. I'm not much of an eye cream type of guy, so I go with my standard Neutrogena Naturals - zero eye burning, for me.",

It did moisturize very well, however after awhile my forehead seemed greasy, which eventually turned into small batches of acne.  I went off of it for awhile and back to my Clinique for men Maximum Hydrator and my skin cleared up.  Back to the anti-age and boom acne again, so I exchanged for another maximum hydrator.  Based on the ingredients its a good option for anti-age, aside from the fact there isn't an SPF.  However it wasn't for me.",

        "comments": "I started using Clinique's Men's line about 4 years ago when I was 26. I had always taken good care of my skin before that, using drug store brand moisturizers on my face. However I started to develop circles under my eyes, so I started using Clinique products to try to combat them. The previous creams reduced the circles a little bit and have prevented them from getting worse over the last few years. When Clinique reformulated their products I was a bit skeptical. However, I was pleased by two things. First, you get twice as much product for the same price, and second, this new product has all but made the circles under my eyes disappear! And in only about a month! I felt the difference the first night I used it. This new cream caused a noticeably tighter sensation than the previous one. With the old line I used to use the anti-aging cream only at night and would use the anti-aging SPF 15 moisturizer in the morning. With the bigger bottles I now use the anti-aging cream morning and night and use the new SPF 21 moisturizer daily. Separating the anti-aging function from the sunscreen function simplifies application and gives you more flexibility to tailor the regimen to your needs. If you're currently using drug store brands and are concerned about the price, don't worry. The bottles are bigger now and you only need a pea sized amount to cover your face. I buy new product on average about every 6 months!",

It was expensive for what it was, but I could afford it and liked the way my skin felt when using it.\nNow Clinique have something called 'anti-age'. An even higher price, and no SPF. Sunscreen was the only effective 'anti aging' ingredient in age defense hydrator. 'Anti-age' offers nothing to justify the price. There are much less expensive and much more effective products on the market. Clinique has lost a customer.",
