Within a couple of days I had horrible deep breakouts under my skin and something that looked like a rash down my neck. I know everyones skin reacts differently but this was not for me. Returned and went back to my drunk elephant.",

For about over a year I have been struggling with my face (ezcema, acene, other dry spots, discoloration) and Cerave products were my holy grail, until it wasn't, since then I have tried numerous products, spent $$$$ and nothing work. For the last 3-4months I have been using La Roche Posay face wash & face moisturizer and its been blah. I have only been using it bc i refused to try something else and spend more money. Finally, my sister suggested Dermalogica and OMG!! All this time I had been suffering. I bought the travel size to test it out bc the full size are pricey, but let me tell you, I don't care they are expensive anymore. I have already purchased the full size products and have a full regimen for my facs. Like I said, \n\nI've only been using the face mositurizer, face wash, the blue bottle exfoliter (twice a week), and the brightening kit (only at night) (all travel size) and my face looks & feels amazing. \n\nThese are expensive products, but theres a spanish saying \"lo bueno cuesta\", in english \"the good things cost\" and with these products, I can agree. Also, a little bit really goes a long way. For the face wash, I only use a pea size and its really more than enough and prettu much same off all other products.",

Not sure uf the formula changed or its just me but it definitely does not feel the same on my face as i remember. I remember being very hydrated and moisturized when i was given the facial, even the next day, whereas when i put this on, it feels like it disappears right away. On top of that, it is very scented like soa, which I don't like walking around and smelling my face all day. On top of that, as soon as i put on the moisturizer, it made my eyes feel the smallest sensation of burning a little bit. Will not be reourchasing again.",
