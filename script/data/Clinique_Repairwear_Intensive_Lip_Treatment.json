There is over half of it below where you can apply it to your lips. So in the process of getting it out you waste it. It runs out way to fast. I love using it, but I feel that they intentionally package it that way to get more money from people. They can say it weighs a certain amount but its bery difficult to get it out. Additionally, the product is out of stock online and every store I tried to get it from.",

Use it at night, morning, and maybe once in the afternoon as needed. This is skin care for your lips, not to be used like the cheaper lip balms which can be used throughout the day. Hense, the cost. I too would like it to be cheaper but this is totally worth it and the tube lasts longer when used as such. My lips are instantly relieved after applying, it nourishes and repaired my chapped and peeling lips. I was an avid lip peeler, but no more!",

When it was difficult (or imossible) to find for a few years I kept my lips slathered with Burt's Bees or something similar and they still chapped anyway. This definitely costs more, but it is worth it to not have my lips chap, peel, and crack. During very cold, below zero winter weather I still wear a waxy lip balm outdoors as a protectant, and I wear sunscreen in the sun. Repairwear keeps my lips healthy, and it does that like nothing else.",

I'm in my 40's so do some good moisturizing, but upped my game to include more moisturizing (Paula's Choice BOOST Hyaluronic Acid + Peptide Lip Booster), using ceramide lip masks at night (Burt's Bees Overnight Intensive Lip Treatment), serums (The Ordinary Amino Acids + B5), Neosporin, and even washing my face with more moisturizing products. It just stayed - like an icicle kiss that would never heal fully. UNTIL THIS. I kid you not, after more than 2 months fighting this dry spot, and 3 days with this and it's almost fully healed and gone. I'll be stocking up on this every Chicago winter for the rest of my days and maybe even the summer too. Has a pretty shine, nice tone (but not so much color that you can't get it outside of your lip line without looking wonky), is lightweight. No smell or taste to speak of. An absolute savior.",

For those who use it only for chapped lips, you're missing the point...this is daily skincare at its finest, and I haven't found a replacement for it ever.\n\nThis lippie keeps my lips exfoliated...no need for lip scrub.  It also keeps my lips plumped all day and night.  I even think it makes my lips slightly larger without all the menthol nonsense found in lipsticks these days.  In short, my aged lips are comfortable and in perfect condition...no crepines, and no little lines on the outside lipline for lipstick to feather into.\n\nI use this lip treatment everytime I brush my teeth.  After using at night, my lips are still moist and wet in the morning.  I remember once recently I didn't wear sunscreen on my lips, so my lips got terribly burned after being outside in horrendous sun and wind and cold all day.  My lips hurt and started cracking and peeling...but after applying this multiple times a day, they healed quickly.  Thank god for this treatment.  If I hadn't been using this for so many years resulting in healthy lips, I'm pretty sure the recovery time would have been much longer.\n\nI don't use a ton of expensive products on my face...only the ones guaranteed to work...Retin-A, Vit C, Niacinamide, and some exfoliant to keep the peeling under control.  But this is truly a must have for me...my little indulgence.",

The other product is a 1/8 of the price but I could not find it anywhere.  As with all Clinique products it was great.  I just received the same effects with the less expensive brand.  I had one issue and that was when I was using it if I didn't re-apply, as it wore off, my lips got dry, they burned.  Never had that experience before.  Also, the tube does not last long.  Not sure why that is.",
