It was easy to remove at the end of the day, stayed put and didn't flake off, and didn't have a sticky \"heavy\" feel to it. It did absolutely everything I hoped for (defined my lashes and was easy to apply), and I experienced no negatives. PERFECT!",

I had hoped that this primer would just separate my lashes and keep them smooth for applying regular mascara, but I was completely shocked when it lengthened my lashes greatly— plus the tint was much more prominent than I expected! My lashes have never looked longer, especially when you top it with a lengthening-based mascara! This primer could go perfectly by itself for natural, lengthened, and darkened lashes!",

        "comments": "I purchased this product in store the day it came out and and have used it four times since. I do not feel like this tinted lash primer does anything extraordinary. It does tint my lashes - but the look it gives is so natural you can't even tell there is something on my lashes. It does not grab every lash - as I do have some very short lashes that were missed. It also seems to be a little more watery of a formula and I find that it smudges along the top lash line pretty easily. \n\nI also don't think that it does a good job layering with a mascara. I found that it made my lashes a little more clumpy than if I had just done my routine of layering two different mascaras. I have tried three different mascaras on top of the lash primer - They're Real, HUGE, and Lights, Camera, Lashes. All of them clumped more than normal and didn't say feathery and separated through the day. \n\nThe brush on this product is also very wiggly. Some would say that it gives you more control and precision - but I disagree. I think that it makes it harder for a perfect application and for not getting smudges on your lash line. \n\nOverall - I think that there are other primers out there, that are white, that do a better job than this one. If you are looking to wear it alone - then go for it, but in terms of a true primer - I would pass.",
