        "comments": "I recently tried the Murad Targeted Eye Depuffer with Peptides and was extremely impressed with the results. As someone who struggles with puffy under eyes, I have tried numerous products with minimal success. However, this eye depuffer has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine.\n\nThe packaging is sleek and convenient, making it easy to apply the product on-the-go. The formula itself is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving no greasy or heavy residue. I also appreciate that it is fragrance-free, making it suitable for those with sensitive skin like myself.\n\nBut the real star of this product is the peptides. These powerful ingredients work wonders in reducing puffiness and dark circles. After using the eye depuffer for just a few days, I noticed a significant difference in the appearance of my under eyes. They looked brighter, smoother, and more awake.\n\nI also love that this product is targeted specifically for the delicate skin around the eyes. The peptides not only depuff, but also help to firm and tighten the skin, giving a more youthful appearance. I have even noticed a reduction in fine lines since incorporating this product into my routine.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the Murad Targeted Eye Depuffer with Peptides. It truly does what it claims and has become an essential in my skincare routine. Whether you struggle with puffiness, dark circles, or fine lines, this product is a game-changer. Give it a try and see the difference for yourself!",

I love the cooling metal applicator, and I've definitely noticed the depuffing effect, I also like that it's safe to use on the entire eye area, not just the under eye, has no noticable scent to it. big wins, but it does take a little while to fully absorb, and has a light reflecting complex designed to illuminate and brighten up the eye area, however with wrinkles, and bags under my eyes that illumination sort of highlights those. I would love this eye cream without the added reflecting complex, with it though I'm a bit less in love. Keep in mind though I have mature skin, and have bags under my eyes, if you don't this would probably be perfect for you.",
