        "comments": "I genuinely don't even know where to start! This curl cream has become my holy Grail and staple in my styling routine. I have 3c curls, low density, low porosity, and fine hair strands.... Imagine how easy it is for my hair to be weighed down!! I've struggled my entire life finding products that work for me because the products that are thin enough on the market are for straight+wavy hair and the products on the market for curly hair were too thick and heavy. Discovering Briogeo, Ouidad, Innersense, and Redken has been where I've had luck. This curl cream is also a leave in cream which is perfect because when I was using a leave in cream on top of my styling products, it always weighed my hair down no matter what I did (trust me, I always water down everything I put in my hair). This curl cream has such a nice slip to it that makes applying it to my hair very nice and smooth! I love the scent as well. Having this in my curl styling routine, my hair can last me about 4-5 days if I really worked for it but Im very particular about my scalp health so I wash my hair every 3 days or so(: the cream itself doesn't leave a cast on my hair, the cast I'm referring to in the pics is from Ouidad's defining mousse which I apply AFTER this cream. I do this because since the conditioning product is this cream, I like doing it first so my hair has a better chance of absorbing moisture and the protein agents of the product too. The product itself is a lightweight to medium weight one, but by watering it down before applying, it works perfectly for me. I love it! My product routine is as follows:\n\nShampoo: Redken curls acidic bonding \nConditioner: Redken curls acidic bonding\nClarifying shampoo: Redken clarifying cream (1x/week)\nScalp cleanse: Briogeo scalp revival mask(1x/week)\nDeep conditioner: rizos curls deep conditioner(1x/week)\n\nLeave-in bonding treatment: Living Proof triple bond complex (2x-4x/week)\nStyling cream: Briogeo defining leave in cream \nStyling mousse: Ouidad curl defining mousse or Innersense I create lift voluming foam\nStyling gel: innersense I create volume gel (use when needed)\nOil: Odele Hair Oil (super lightweight!!)",

        "comments": "I've been looking for a non-toxic curl cream to replace Redken Frizz Dismiss cream, which ive been using for close to a decade. I tried a few products and finally found this and haven't looked back! It smells amazing and doesnt leave my hair feeling cakey or greasy like some products I tried did. I comb my wet hair, then use about two quarters worth of product and scrunch it in, then let it dry. I know some people complain it left their hair stringy and hard, but it softens up throughout the day and overnight, leaving my hair looking great natural. Would definitely recommend, especially for those looking to replace thd Redken cream or something similar!",

The unfortunate thing is I, for the life of me, can't take the smell. It's not even that strong, but I notice after a couple hours of having it on, I feel dizzy and have a headache. It's happened every time I put this on. I wish I didn't have such a sensitive nose, but not much I can do about that. \n\nIf you're not sensitive to fragrance, this cream will probably work great for you.",

I have 3c curls, low density, low porosity, and fine hair strands.... Imagine how easy it is for my hair to be weighed down!! I've struggled my entire life finding products that work for me because the products that are thin enough on the market are for straight+wavy hair and the products on the market for curly hair were too thick and heavy. Discovering Briogeo, Ouidad, Innersense, and Redken has been where I've had luck. This curl cream is also a leave in cream which is perfect because when I was using a leave in cream on top of my styling products, it always weighed my hair down no matter what I did (trust me, I always water down everything I put in my hair). This curl cream has such a nice slip to it that makes applying it to my hair very nice and smooth! I love the scent as well. Having this in my curl styling routine, my hair can last me about 4-5 days if I really worked for it but Im very particular about my scalp health so I wash my hair every 3 days or so(: the cream itself doesn't leave a cast on my hair, the cast I'm referring to in the pics is from Ouidad's defining mousse which I apply AFTER this cream. I do this because since the conditioning product is this cream, I like doing it first so my hair has a better chance of absorbing moisture and the protein agents of the product too. The product itself is a lightweight to medium weight one, but by watering it down before applying, it works perfectly for me. I love it! My product routine is as follows:\n\nShampoo: Redken curls acidic bonding \nConditioner: Redken curls acidic bonding\nClarifying shampoo: Redken clarifying cream (1x/week)\nScalp cleanse: Briogeo scalp revival mask(1x/week)\nDeep conditioner: rizos curls deep conditioner(1x/week)\n\nLeave-in bonding treatment: Living Proof triple bond complex (2x-4x/week)\nStyling cream: Briogeo defining leave in cream \nStyling mousse: Ouidad curl defining mousse or Innersense I create lift voluming foam\nStyling gel: innersense I create volume gel (use when needed)\nOil: Odele Hair Oil (super lightweight!!)",

I fell in love with this line's ingredients and currently use Briogeo curly charisma co-wash and I love it so far. However, this curl cream is no bueno! I have fine/medium 2b-3a curl patterns. When I put it in it felt good and smelled nice and clean. I leave my hair to air dry always. It felt great putting in the hair, not too thin or too thick. But I noticed immediately my curls looked too tight, and as it was drying there was a crunchy feeling to it. After it finally dried, the crunch went away, but my hair looked frizzy, weighed down, and had no define for my curls at all. The curls, on the top of my head, were very tight and the rest of my hair was stringy. My curl pattern was gone. In the morning, my hair was a tangled mess. I Will be returning and trying a new product until I find the right one- I guess.",
