I have seen a HUGE difference. \nI would dare to say this moisturizer is a little bit greasy, so if you have oily skin I really don't think this is for you. \nI tried it on my t-zone (I have an oily t-zone) and it just looked way too greasy, so I now apply it all over my face and neck, except for my t-zone, and I really like the look and feel it gives my face. \nTotally recommend if you're looking for a dewy feel, winter time moisturizer, or if you have dry skin. \nIt's a little pricey, but if it works I'm willing to pay.",

I have seen a HUGE difference. \nI would dare to say this moisturizer is a little bit greasy, so if you have oily skin I really don't think this is for you. \nI tried it on my t-zone (I have an oily t-zone) and it just looked way too greasy, so I now apply it all over my face and neck, except for my t-zone, and I really like the look and feel it gives my face. \nTotally recommend if you're looking for a dewy feel, winter time moisturizer, or if you have dry skin. \nIt's a little pricey, but if it works I'm willing to pay.",
