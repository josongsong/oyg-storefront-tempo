I love Laneige because of the texture and how it feels/looks on my lips and I kid you not, this is definitely a dupe for way less of the cost! I think I like it even more! 🫣 I only bought this pack, but I will definitely be buying them all! 🙂",

        "comments": "I had high hopes due to how good the vanilla, strawberry and peach were (I don't have the honey dew one)  and those hopes weren't disappointed! The first one I purchased was the vanilla and it just blew me away with what $4 could get you. The mango scent reminds me of mango Italian ice, which is one of my favorite summer treats. The watermelon one reminds me of watermelons and it smells very sweet but not to sweet! Of course the containers aren't huge but again don't forget how much you paid. A lot of people seem to be bothered by how it isn't filled all the way, but I've had the other ones for a long time and I have yet to get to the point where they are a struggle to come out. My point is that they go a long way. Another thing I love is that they moisturize my lips but also have a glossy look to them which like great. I hope this review helps!",

Just some advice don't listen to the first few comments they wouldn't know unless (like the person under me said) they got it in pr or something which I highly doubt. Some people rely on buying products off of the reviews so please stop posting before you even TRY the product. So aggravating!!!! Please elf change the option to only post reviews if you actually got the product and also make a like , dislike and report button",
