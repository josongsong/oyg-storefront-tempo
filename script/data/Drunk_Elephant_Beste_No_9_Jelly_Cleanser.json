It's a super gentle formula that removes all my makeup, sunscreen, and oil without making my skin feel tight or stripped. The gel lathers nicely and rinses off clean, leaving my face soft and refreshed. I love that it's free from harsh ingredients like fragrance and silicones, making it perfect for my sensitive skin. Plus, it hydrates while it cleanses, thanks to glycerin, so my skin feels balanced afterward. Definitely a must-have for anyone looking for a gentle, effective cleanser! Gifted by drunkelephant",
