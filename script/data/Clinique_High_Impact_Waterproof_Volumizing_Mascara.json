This Clinique mascara did none of that.  After a couple hours of wearing it- it looks like you barely have any mascara on at all.  Your curls look limp and sad and it does not offer any significant volume or length.  Would not recommend or ever buy again.  I recommend Benefit BADgal Bang  Waterproof Mascara, it's so much better.  I wish I had just repurchased that one instead.",

I'm a mascara freak and have had trouble finding any one mascara that I really liked during my lifetime of putting on makeup, but this one's a winner! I was using the regular High Impact mascara, but switched to this waterproof one when it came out. I have sensitive eyes and they tend to tear a lot. When I was using the regular one, sometimes the tear would end up messing my mascara and making it run. This one stays in place. I was using the lash primer at first but then tried it without the primer. I like it better without the primer. It comes on smoother and no clumps. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because it takes a while to get it off with regular eyemakeup remover, so I was forced to buy the \"Take the Day Off\" for lids, lips. It does do a good job but since I use the 24 hour mascara and the bottom lash one, it still takes a while to take it off. At least I don't have to rub hard. But it's worth it, the mascara. My lashes really stand out and my eyes don't tear up. I'm a real Clinique fan!",

I've used multiple mascara removers. It appears to be gone but either after the shower or after sleeping...it's on my cheeks. I'd recommend highly High Impact Curly. In hot hot water - like shower or hot tub - it falls completely off your face. No smudging or reminence. But it'll stay on in the rain, swimming, sweating. It's perfect. No matter what the next line says I did NOT receive a free sample of this product or review as part of a sweepstakes. It cost me $24 and I'm throwing it out.",
