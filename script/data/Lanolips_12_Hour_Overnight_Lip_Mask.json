I use it every night alone, then during the day under the Lanolips tinted balm.  I have a medical condition that leaves my lips not just dry, but they peel and crack until they bleed.  It is very painful and I have tried everything to no avail.  For the last couple of years, I had been using Clinique moisture surge- but this is so much better!  I was in a pretty bad state- my lips hurt so darn bad.  I was nervous of trying this since it is lanolin and I am allergic to wool.  Surprisingly, I did not have a reaction.  Within days, the peeling, flaking, everything was gone!  I mean, I have had issues for years and this just magically healed everything!  I can't believe my lips are soft, nourished, and feel good! My husband was so impressed, he started using the 12 hour balm too- he has psoriasis and uses this everywhere- lips, elbows, wherever.  It is a miracle ointment in a tube.  It does not have a lip applicator, but I don't really mind since I am using this for multi-purpose.  This is a \"can't live without\" product for sure!!!",

From the first application I noticed a tingling sensation which I dismissed at first thinking it was possibly just transfer from a different product I dipped my finger into. After  applying it a second time I noticed it again and went to the Lano site to see if it is mentioned at all. The tingling can be caused by the vitamin C although I was not aware of that being an affect because it is not stated on the product or Ulta site at all. I would say the tingling for me at least lasts about 15 minutes so if you don't mind it's still a good product. In terms of performance it's alright if Im being honest I would say less is more and will just stick to my usual Lanolips ointment 101 tube (which is pure lanolin) in comparison to this product that has other ingredients listed. I will wait out and see if its any better as it has only been a day since I used it but for first impressions im not impressed.",
