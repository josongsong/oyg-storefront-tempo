        "comments": "I have type 4 hair with medium/coarse strands, curl pattern intact, and my go to style is a silk press. My right side is coarser than my left and requires higher heat to hold curls or it won't hold long at all. \n\n   I typically wear my hair straight until it starts to get a little weighed down and oily. Then, I'll add curls to revive it and get at least another week of wear. Sometimes I'll use dry shampoo, sometimes I don't. But I always use a hairspray. I'm not going to lie and act as if I've tried 100s of hairsprays. I've only used about 6 in total. But this is the best for wearable, long lasting curls that don't feel hard or crunchy. It really didn't seem like it was going to work when I sprayed it. Maybe because I'm so used to being able to feel the hairspray and this felt like nothing, so I assumed it was weak and wouldn't hold. I went to bed without putting my hair up and was shocked that I woke up to my wand curls still intact. Usually, when I fall asleep with my hair not in pin curls, the curls end up flat and greasy. I did that for 3 nights and it held up. I would have gone longer, but I was already a week past wash day. It doesn't flake when you brush through it and there's no residue. It washes out easily. Though, I am surprised that Kenra rates it a level 26 out of 30 for hold because this doesn't seem anywhere near THAT strong. And I'm kind of sad mine came with a clear top instead of the silver cap that the Platinum line is supposed to have, but that doesn't affect the product. Just how it looks... \n\n   I have a can of Sebastian Shaper Fierce from almost 10 years ago because I pretty much stopped needing hairspray right after getting it. But now that I'm using it again, it's way too strong. Nowhere near as strong as BB Spritz or Got2B hairspray, but too strong for flowing hair. Too hard to comb through and, when I did, the cast/hold would completely break and cause flaking hair and limp curls. Big Sexy added too much texture and volume and was also hard to comb. I tried Paul Mitchell Flexible Clean Spray on clean AND dirty hair, and it didn't do anything. I would spray more and more to see if the hold was buildable, but nothing happened. And when it did do something, it wasn't for long. I bought a travel size bottle of Kenra 13 spray at the same time I got this but haven't used it yet. But if I were to go by the rating, it might be nice to hold those soft curls for body on freshly washed hair.",
