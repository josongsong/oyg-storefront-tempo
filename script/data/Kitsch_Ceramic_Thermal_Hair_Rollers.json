I used Big Sexy Root Boost before blow drying and put the rollers in my hair dry. After that I did a little more heat to each roller. I did use clips. After I took them out there was a ton of volume. Of course it fell with time but if you want it to last longer add a little teasing. This is not for curling your hair, this is to add volume.",

        "comments": "Well, I have fine, thin hair. So, I started using volumizers which helps for about half the day. So I saw these at Ulta and thought those might be something I should try. So I have been experimenting with them. I used a good styling spray with different dampness of my hair. It was very full (fluffy) at first but within a couple hours it fell into a very straight style. BUT - the problem was the rollers had quite a few hair strands when I removed them. I would recommend these to people with thick hair!! I am 72 so these probably weren't the best option for me. My hair is long and maybe I simply need to get it cut short!",

I only manged to get tye very large one to stick on one small section. They also leave creases in your hair because of the way they lay. I wouldnt recommend these.",

        "comments": "For years I've struggled with getting my hair to hold a curl, volume, or any kind of shape. I've used curling irons, flat irons, and brush/blow dry. I've had varying degrees of success with the aforementioned, but NEVER consistent results. I knew rollers would be a good option for me, but I will admit -- I was lazy and never got them. Until about two weeks ago when I finally ordered these and let me tell you ... my hair has never looked better.   Here's how I use the rollers: I separate my damp hair into chunks, blow out individual sections, and roll + pin immediately. Then I let the rollers sit for about 1-2 hours depending on how much time I have. When I take the rollers out, my hair has wonderful curl and volume, and it lasts! And there aren't any weird \"marks\" from the curling iron or from a clip (my attempt at getting the curl to hold). Of course, it is winter so I'll be curious to see how they work in the summer, but I have high hopes based on the result so far.  For reference my hair is medium length, naturally straight and \"fine\" but I have a TON of it which makes it hard to do it myself PLUS, it's heavy, so holding a curl is always a struggle. I bought two packages and always use 3/4 of them.",

        "comments": "I am writing now after ten minutes of actual terror trying to get one of the eight rollers out of my hair. \n\nMy hair is long and fine, and seven of the eight rollers came out like a dream. However, there was one roller framing my face that refused to come out. Even though I had rolled it just like the others, there was no movement of any strand of hair, no matter what I tried. There was no \"correct\" direction to pull the hair... no \"correct\" angle... no \"good piece\" of hair to start with… no hair moved at all. It was very hard to hold back tears at this point because the only options I could imagine were either ripping out all this healthy hair or cutting out the roller about three inches from my scalp. \n\nWhen working on dry hair didn't work, I tried to use every \"slippery\" product I could think of: detangling spray, leave-in conditioner, and finally, Vaseline. I eventually got enough hair loose to begin to unroll the roller with my head still under running water in the sink.\n\nThis was the most traumatic hair issue I have ever experienced. I will be returning this product and issuing a serious warning to anyone interested in adding a little volume to their ends after heat styling. I had read reviews that Velcro rollers were generally difficult to remove, but I thought I was immune because I have straight, silky, fine hair. If anything, I thought they wouldn't stay in well!\n\nPlease do not try this product. I'm begging you. Not even once. Not even one roller. No product has EVER destroyed my hair like this. Please learn from me!",
