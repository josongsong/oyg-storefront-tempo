Gives a beautiful glow that's just enough.\nDefinitely my new favorite!\nYou won't be disappointed.",

I have sensitive, combo, acne prone skin and it's been so hard finding products that don't upset my skin one way or another, but they've made it very easy for me. Their products are extremely clean which I think allows my skin to handle them so well, ESPECIALLY the oil! Any type of oil ever has always broken me out so I was very nervous to try this and ruin any progress on my skin, but it truly blew me away with how it made my skin even CLEARER! This oil is extremely lightweight despite how hydrating it is, it was the extra push my skin needed to fully heal my skin barrier. My skin has genuinely never looked more beautiful and I'm so extremely pleased with this brand. I will alway recommend this brand to people, and now this product has made it to those recommendations!",

It was so freaking dry that every time I'd go outside I felt like the moisture in my skin was instantly gone. It made my skin tight and uncomfortable. So I went into an Ulta and found this and bought it because it was the most affordable product that emphasized it was \"ULTRA HYDRATING.\" \nI took it back to my hotel and put it on immediately. The rest of my trip I had no more problems with the atmosphere sucking my face dry. It was love at first use. \n\nHOWEVER, I CAN MAKE THIS MYSELF FOR 1/20th THE PRICE\n\nIt's 98% camellia oil, which is relatively affordable and 2% sea buckthorn oil, which also very affordable for a quality cold pressed oil. You don't even need to use a special technique to mix them together or keep the two oils from separating. Just add them together, shake and boom. Oil mixture is perfected. \n\nBut I love this product so much that I still buy it from Good Molecules every so often because I want to show my support for introducing me to the combo. \n\nFREAKING LOVE IT!",

Unfortunately my skin gets pink and feels irritated when I use this. I'm wondering if it actually only has just two oils in the product",
