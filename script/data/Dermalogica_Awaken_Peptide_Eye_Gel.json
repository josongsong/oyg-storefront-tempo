I've read the instructions for use of this product but it doesn't say that you should let it cure for a while before applying anything over it.  If I apply concealer over it within a few minutes the concealer gobs up then when I try an eye sponge to smooth it out it turns into shreds and will even get into my hair - then have to use a big dry sponge to remove the shreds.  Have tried different brands of concealers but the reaction is the same. It's infuriating!  I can't even say it does it's job because I can't leave it under my eyes AND apply makeup or even makeup primer after applicaion.  This stuff is not cheap!  and I would love to return it and get my money back.",

Rather than pay shipping to get it from dermalogica directly I picked this stuff up at my local Ulta to try instead. I've been using it 3 months now and honestly I feel like my dark circles and eye bags are more prominent now than they were with the other eye cream. This also does not feel hydrating at all. It absorbs quickly and makes the skin feel tight. I will definitely be switching to something else. Would not recommend and would not use again.",

        "comments": "I have been using this eye cream for a few weeks now, at least once a day, every day, and I love it. I have tried many different eye creams over the years to try and keep the area hydrated and have found most affordable creams do little and you have to get the high end cosmeceuticals to get a noticeable improvement. Then I tried this eye cream and it changed my opinion. My work is constantly stressful and hectic at the moment and with wearing PPE every shift you just cannot be kind to yourself (dehydrating, sweating profusely in the PPE, long hours etc). So you can imagine the delicate skin around the eyes really shows when you are tired and your face ends up in not great shape constantly. This cream has helped me not look so much like I have not slept properly since 2019 even though I am lucky to get 5hrs a night. It is light and absorbs quickly, whilst still giving an hydrated feeling to the skin all day. I cannot stand the feeling of any product lingering on my skin and I do not wear makeup so I notice immediately if products feel greasy or present on my face. The texture is a semi-opaque gel creme, that is not too firm or liquidy. You do not need heaps to get a good effect and it spreads well with fingertip tapping without feeling like you are dragging the skin. You can see it start to work on puffy, tired eyes within about 5-10 minutes but it does not give you that tightness of some de-puffing eye creams (hate that feeling). I wear contacts as well so having product that does not irritate, even if you get sweat into your eyes, taking the product with it, is vital for me. This does not irritate and has also gone well under the light matte type facial sun screens you can get now. Have not tried with makeup. Does not have any heavy fragrance to it. Definitely works to reduce the appearance of light fine lines and light-moderate darkness under eyes from normal lack of sleep. Packaging is lovely and you can easy dispense just the right amount, even if you keep it in the fridge, which makes it feel even more refreshing. The only tiny pilling I noticed was when I would try to reapply the cream without first cleansing my face (yes I know bad idea) and if I rubbed my eyes but other than that you could happily reapply a top up at end of hard day if needed in an emergency. Overall definitely recommend giving this a try morning or night it definitely worked for me and the amount in the tube is good value for the price",

        "comments": "I've been trying out many of the popular new eye care treatments on the market right now aimed to have immediate results at eliminating wrinkles, puffiness and bags. I was excited when Dermalogica gifted me their Awaken Peptide Eye Gel for my honest review. Unfortunately I was left unimpressed. I truly love Dermalogica and haven't ever had a product not have results for me so this took me by surprise. I am going to give it a try on my husband (when he returns from his long trip) as he has very noticeable bags. I did like the nice cooling affect I received from this gel. It felt great in the morning. I'm hoping over time to see more results and  will be sure to come back and share my thoughts at that time. I left this review on their other eye cream but the link I clicked on directed to the wrong product.",
