I had bleached my hair and became a ash blonde and bleaching my roots every other month to maintain the color completely fried my hair through out time i had to do a big chop and my hair was sooo damaged still i refused to chop it all off. Even when i would do rollers and blow dry my hair, my hair still felt rough like hay. After wearing my hair in a high bun for months my hair grew a inch or two and it feels less roughbut its still rough. I washed my hair and when it was ready to be styled i used a quarter amount rubbed it in with both palms\nAnd worked it into my hair mid hair to ends. I blow dried my hair and flat iron after and my hair feels so healthy no split ends or flying hairs. My hair feels strong, healthy and full. This hair cream is also a heat protector and i love the way it works with heat applied. I recommend this product to anyone that has damaged hair thats trying to grow their hair out or even looking for a good heat protector. This is it. This product has won me as a customer this will be part of my hair regimen for ever. I apply this on damp hair before styling with heat.",

It was up to bat against Redkens Oil For All and Kerastase products. It surpassed all of them. \nThis oil is VERY light weight and works perfectly with my very long fine hair. Usually i have issues with strands looking greasy from leave-in products, but the JVN Complete Nourishing Shine Drops add no stringy appearance, actually supported some bounce in days-old curls, and smoothed out frizz without adding weight. It smells amazing too, but isnt heavily perfumed.",

Its fluffy, its got some volume (i didn't use any volume products, which I usually do because I have a TON of fine, flat hair.) It dried relatively quickly, its got nice texture and it smells nice but very faint, which I appreciate. \n\nOverall will definitely keep buying. I tried to be constructive but I haven't found anything about it that I dislike. The price also seems reasonable given how little I had to use, and I have a lot of hair.",

I noticed that instant recovery serum come in a little glass jar. I've purchased that product before and I thibk it makes for easier to get last bits than this tube. The aluminum is great for being infinitly recycled. I just don't think it's super accessible. Once you have less of the product it get s hard and maybe even jagged. I cut into the tube to get the remaining bits (be super careful if you do this aluminum is sharp!!) and also noticed there was a plastic film on the inside. So maybe it's not the most sustainable option either. This is a plea to change the design of the tube to a glass jar like the recovery serum. I'm aware that might make it harder to tell which is which. You could change to color of the caps to make it easier to differentiate. As a customer who loves jvn I would love to see a more accessible container doe this product.",

I prefer to spray a tiny bit of leave-in conditioner (any brand) into my palm and apply with my hands so I can control the amount that actually goes into my hair. But the spray nozzle is useless even using it that way. It clogged after only about three uses. The sprayer gets more and more difficult to use, then it poops out altogether. I can't imagine trying to mist this onto my hair. It's definitely not a fine mist to start with. The spray nozzle has One Job and fails miserably at it. (It's possible to improve the spray a little by rinsing it in hot water and scrubbing in. But consumers shouldn't have to maintain the container a product comes in just to use the product!)\nTo JVN: I suggest either making the conditioner thinner (and charging less) or using a different kind of spray nozzle, such a a trigger sprayer. Or make it a different formulation altogether, such as a foam.",
