This one is perfect. I usually use eye shadow primer but even without primer these shades do not fade or crease much. Works great for my green hazel eyes. Sturdy palette too. Highly recommend.",

Higher end-wise, I've invested in brands like Pat McGrath, Urban Decay, Nars, and now MAC. Pat McGrath is lovely, but honestly, I just found the pricing unreasonable for the amount of product you get. This MAC palette is really beautiful, great application and staying power, and a really fair price for the amount of product, performance, and the name (let's face it - we are paying more for a \"high end\" name).

Unfortunately, every combination of shadows resulted in severe creasing within a few hours, and muddying of the colors so that I could no longer tell that multiple colors were applied.  Sadly, this is going back.  I have drug store and budget friendly shadows like Colourpop that don't do this on me.",

The shadows in this palette are incredibly pigmented, go on silky smooth for crease free all-day wear even in humid climates. There is a mix of matte nude shades and shimmers that allow endless combinations for natural, glam and smoky looks. For my everyday routine I am more of a neutral matte gal but I found myself reaching for the incredibly beautiful shimmer and glitter shades. I found them to be very versatile during my vacation when I misplaced my brushes and was able to achieve a great look just by blending shades with my fingers dry and then wet for a more intense smoky eye. I would definitely recommend the MAC connect Hi-Fi color palette to my friends that want high quality nude shades that are perfect for any occasion and flatters many skin tones",

Now when it comes to the eyeshadows itself the colors were beautiful. However, the formula is a bit sheer and I did have a bit of fallout. Because it was so sheer blending was a bit difficult and just made everything muddy. I was really hoping to love this product because I've never had anything MAC before but this wasn't the case. Hope to find something that will work for me.",
