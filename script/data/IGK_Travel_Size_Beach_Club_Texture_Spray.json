        "comments": "Now that i am re-reading the packaging, it says \"no crunch\" on it. The \"no crunch\" means no fresh out of the ocean texture. I was looking for a texture spray that gave tue super piecey, salt water-esq texture. This product is more soft to the touch and adds lots of volume but without the piecey, ocean hair feel. So, it does what it says. I just wanted that tough texture to my hair with a little bit of weigh-down. Its good. And it smells lovely. Like fresh from the salon scent. Not a beachy summery scent. Still nice. Ill try something else next time.",

        "comments": "*Completely* blown away. WOW!! I have very fine hair that is super sensitive to product and when I tell you I have tried everything, I mean it. I had given up on hair products altogether until a friend recommended IGK Beach Club. This stuff is incredible—it gives me volume, smells amazing, and doesn't cause any grease or shorten the life of my hair (I like to wash every 2-3 days). THANK YOU IGK I LOVE YOU.",

        "comments": "I have short, straight, soft hair which needs some grip and texture. This spray is okay. It's lightweight and comes out with the velocity of a firehose so it penetrates and doesn't just land on the surface of the hair. I don't think it's that different from an ordinary hairspray - ? -  and I really, really don't like the smell. My hair looks pretty good though, the spray doesn't dull the shine or anything. I probably won't repurchase just because of the smell.",
