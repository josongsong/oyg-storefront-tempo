I have sensitive skin,  a little on the oily side, never broke out from using or had any problems with this product. Money well spent! Also the swirl blush and cream bronzer BOTH blend like a dream and also have hardly any smell! In general I'm glad I revisited Morphe! So afordable too!",

It also perfectly matches Morphe Filter Soft-Focus Foundation in Filter Light 6. It's a neutral light shade with a slight hint of warmth. It's not as longwearing on acne scars  however  it wears nicely on the undereyes. It never looks patchy or dry  and it has buildable medium to full coverage without looking cakey. It's not transfer-proof as it does transfer onto face masks  however  it is transfer resistant. It has a skin-like natural satin finish. Also  it's infused with great ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and glycerin  which gives it a hydration and moisture boost. I can see this working on dry and sensitive skin. Moreover  I love that it has a flat flexible long doe foot applicator  which holds a lot of product  so you can conceal all the spots on the entire face without redipping. And the applicator is narrow and flexible  so it's easy to control how much you want to apply to a spot. And  it comes in 20 different shades.",

        "comments": "I received this concealer for free from Influenster and Morphe in exchange for my honest review.  I have dark skin and deal with dark spots due to hyperpigmentation so I was exited to try this new formula which included ingredients to brighten and care for skin while wearing - I'm conflicted with the fact it contain hyaluronic acid as if you are already using skincare that contains this is may be damaging in the long run so keep that in mind.  The packaging and containers were very nice and the consistency was very smooth and not heavy or sticky. I probably would have picked a darker colour but nonetheless this could still work especially when used for highlighting and contouring.  I also tried this with the foundation but I found they didn't sit well unfortunately not sure why that it is but I did find the foundation to be somewhat chalky so that could be why.  Overall I would recommend this concealer especially if you have oily skin such as myself.",
