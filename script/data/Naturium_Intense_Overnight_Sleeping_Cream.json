Naturium products a high quality clean products that actually deliver results. The proce point is very good and their products work just as well as higher price point products, so when I needed a nighttime moisturizer that was clean, result oriented, and reasonablly priced, I turned to Naturium. I was not disappointed! Their Intense overnight Cream is extremely hydrating and it sinks right into your skin. I have very dry skin and this product delivered real results for me. My skin does ot feel tight or look flakey when I wake up. It looks glowey andhydrated. Another great product from Naturium!",

        "comments": "I started buying Naturium products about 6 months ago and am growing to really love the brand. I have dry, very sensitive skin and appreciate all the options for my skin type. I have been using this cream for several months, every single night, and have gone through at least 5 jars. I loved it. I just started using my latest jar with the new vegan formula. The consistency is just…off. The old formula was rich and creamy. The new formula is clumpy, somewhat like homemade play-doh. It comes out of the jar in gelatinous clumps, nothing like the original creamy consistency. Product still performs ok, less hydrating than the original. I also have to take much more time working it in my skin since it is so clumpy, which then irritates my reactive skin. Just a very strange consistency unlike any other face cream, not in a good way. Original cream was 5 stars…",
