After using Dermalogica's Phyto-Nature Eye Cream extensively for a few weeks, I'm thrilled to share my experience. gifted by Dermalogica, from the first application, I noticed the cream's lightweight yet hydrating texture, which absorbs beautifully without leaving any greasy residue. It instantly gave my under-eye area a fresh, well-rested appearance. Over the past few weeks, I've seen some truly encouraging results. My fine lines have visibly softened, and the overall texture of my skin feels smoother and more supple. What impresses me the most is how this eye cream has brightened my under-eye area, reducing the appearance of dark circles that have been a constant concern for me. The natural ingredients in the formula seem to work wonders, providing a refreshing and rejuvenating effect that lasts throughout the day. Overall, Dermalogica's Phyto-Nature Eye Cream has become a staple in my skincare routine. It's effective, gentle, and delivers on its promises. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an eye cream that genuinely works, especially if you're in your 30s and want to maintain a youthful, vibrant look.",

        "comments": "First and foremost, I'll start by saying I have mixed feelings on this. Being in my forties, an eye cream is imperative. I need something that's going to hydrate, plump, brighten, and address signs of aging.  With that being said, I also need something that is affordable that I can replace when the time comes without breaking the bank. Unfortunately, although this one does work decent, it is not something that I would be able replace as needed- so it's a good thing  only a tiny bit is needed and this bottle will last for a little while. So, how does it work? It actually seems to work fairly well. It has a medium to thicker consistency that absorbs nicely into my under eye area. It is slightly sticky at first but that does dissipate, leaving my under eye looking and feeling hydrated, plumped, and smoothed now that I've been using it both a.m. and p.m. for a few weeks now. As far as the lifting effect, yes I think it does.. temporarily. I don't think it's a permanent solution by any means, so as long as I can continue to afford this eye cream, I'm good. This wears very nicely under my makeup. There's no pilling, no separating, just a nice hydrated base for my concealer to lie on. Now onto the ingredients. Considering this is vegan, it is made with a lot of different natural oils and extracts, one of which being peppermint. If you have sensitive skin or eye area, proceed with caution. I personally have have no adverse reactions, but I feel like it's worth noting.\n\nOverall, I do really enjoy this, but sadly it will not be able to repurchase once this is gone. Two stars removed for price point. Complimentary from Dermalogica",
