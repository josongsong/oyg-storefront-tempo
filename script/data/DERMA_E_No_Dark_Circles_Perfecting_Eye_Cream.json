I made sure I warmed the product in-between my fingers and when I dabbed it under my eyes before blending it all and it still was pilling on me.\nIf your skincare is mostly water-based serums, moisturizers and toners I say pass on this. This does not sit on the skin well with water based skincare products since it's a very oil-based product. A little goes a long way but a lot comes out when you squeeze it. Make sure to shake it before using it also because some separation happens in the tube.",

It smells like tumeric, and it will still smell that way all day. VERY, very liquidy. I would put a finger over the applicator so that it doesn't get all over your face, because if you try to apply it with the applicator, that might happen. Maybe it's because I took a trip in very high altitude with it, but one day (once I got back) it wouldn't stop coming out of the container, and it was so messy that I had to throw it away. I'm so glad it was on sale so that I didn't waste too much money on it.",

I have the habit of always using more then what you need. So naturally I over did it with the amount I applied the first time and it was a mess! I was very disappointed because I had high hopes for this product. The next morning I tried a pea size amount to cover both eyes and it absorbed beautifully into my skin! I tapped it onto my skin with my ringer finger and it went in nicely. Turmeric is yellow and stains, hence the color of the product, which is why a little goes a long way. Overall I have been using this product for 1 week both in the AM and PM and I have been noticing a difference, my dark circles are definitely lighter!",

It feels heavy, thick, smells like sun screen and is highly pigmented, just like a concealer.  The applicator is almost exactly like a tube of lip gloss.  You dont need much , but because its not creamy, it wont spread well, be-careful when dispensing because the applicator dispenses to much at once.  Since i am not that  light skinned, this product is not for me.  i was hoping for a serum or smooth cream, and what i got was more of a make-up product and a product that severely disappoints.",
