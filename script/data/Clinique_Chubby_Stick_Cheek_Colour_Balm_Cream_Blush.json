        "comments": "I bought the Roly Poly Rosy yesterday, and after using Clinique products for the past 40 years, I can't believe I never tried this chubby stick before! Although it hasn't been around for 40 years, I regret not trying it when it first came out. I love it! This particular color is such a pretty pink, which complements my fair skin and dark blondish-brown hair beautifully.\n\nI've found that applying it higher on my cheekbones instead of on the apples of my cheeks really enhances my facial structure. When I apply it to my apples, my face looks rounder and heavier, but when I focus on my cheekbones, it gives me a more angular look. I also dab it on my lips, and it looks stunning!\n\nWhile I've used powder blush forever and still love it, I appreciate how this chubby stick gives me a lovely dewy finish. I'm 57 and any dewiness does help with my look! I will definitely be trying a couple more colors! Highly recommend!",

It's a sheer berry tint and looks great. These are so easy to apply. You can put the color right where you want and it blends really nicely. I won't be going back to powder blush anytime soon.",

I was given the Chubby stick when I went to Nordstrom's Clinique counter and asked for 03 Rosy Blush. I was shocked when I got home to find what looked like a large crayon. I believe the diameter is smaller and it takes quite a few swiped to get color.\n\nI dont feel it blends well at all. This formula is not as creamy and smooth as the other blush. The 03 color isnt the same, and it takes a few swipes to get any color at all on my cheeks. It used to be a no brainer, swipe and blend and out the door. I understand the nice silver tube of old was probably more expensive to manufacture, but wish you kept the same color range and product formula and had and put it into the crayon tube you now have. I don't know if the good grades have come from customers who havent used the previous tube blush and maybe they dont know any better. I dont understand why, as they say \"if it aint broke, dont fix it.\" I always have bought Clinique cosmetics, but I wont frequent your counter any more. I see the old product sells online by rogue sellers for up to $59.00!!! For the price to go that high, customers are still clambering for it. Bring it back!",
