Along with other dietary changes and skin care products, this cleanser for has done an AMAZING job clearing out my pores, breaking up my post acne scars and smoothing my skin in only 1 month! I use this cleanser once daily at night since it exfoliates skin. I've tried using it 2x/day, but it felt drying. I can honestly say that this cleanser has completely enhanced the other products I use and has started giving me the skin of my dreams. Trust the process, don't over exfoliate, balance with a neutral cleanser for the AM and use SPF in the morning.\nAM:\nKopari marine cleanser\nThayer rose witch hazel toner\nFenty SPF moisturizer \nPM:\nELEMIS CLEANSER\nthayer rose witch hazel\nCaudalie Vinoperfect glycolic essence\nCaudalie Vinoperfect serum \nPonds Clarant B3 moisturizer",

I have KP on my face along my jaw and it completely smooths out my skin and rebalances the feel of my skin. It does not dry me out and it smells rich and luxurious. I refuse to use anything except Elemis face washes. The way this works compares to NOTHING I have ever used. It does everything it claims and more. This is the perfect facewash to use before makeup because it has your base so smooth and ready to go.",

I've only been using it for a week but wrinkles actually have softened. I highly recommend this product. BTW, it appears that it will last a really long time as well. I give it a 10 out of 10!!",

All those under the skin bumps are gone and complexion clear. I look forward to using it mostly due to the scent. It's so fresh.

I have semi-oily skin and need a quality cleaner that also tightens my pores. My skin is\nin excellent shape for my age. I found that the Elemis cleared up the oily patches and smoothed out the texture\nof my skin. I also use it on my neck and around my earlobes. It has always been a wonderful face cleaner for\nme to use. I recently purchased the Elemis Pump Face Wash and love it even more! For me it is more user friendly.\nIt is a well designed bottle and is also very attractive if you want to leave it sitting out. The face wash leaves my face\nfeeling clean and refreshed. It adds radiance to my skin after I rinse it off and pat dry. I noticed that the oily\npatches stay clean for hours after usage. I would recommend this Elemis face wash to any person of any age, \ngender or race.",

I really love Elemis products, I came off of them for awhile and now that I am back on - I doubt I'll change ever again.\r\n\r\nI do wish that Elemis came out with a line that helps skin recover after sever trauma, like an accident. My younger sister was in an accident and there's not much out there.\r\n\r\nI got her the Dynamic set to help prevent hyperpigmentation, however, if Elemis had like a face cooling gel mask or something that would help prevent swelling on the face (while reducing the risk of infection) or some skin healing promoting pills that would be awesome.\r\n\r\nI'm actually very surprised that Elemis hasn't come out with a proper skin, hair and nails vitamin yet that puts every one to shame. \r\n\r\nAll in all, this product is a MUST have and it will last you an incredible long time!",

        "comments": "I was really excited to try this cleanser and frankly I am a little disappointed. It leaves my skin feeling clean and not too dry, removes makeup well. I just don't feel like it's anything extraordinary for me. I don't see a difference in skin texture or overall tone. It is effective, but not any more than products that are a fraction of the price. It's just not worth the money to me. If you are a person who is searching for a good cleanser and money is not an object, then this would work great for you. I personally just can't justify spending so much on something that isn't doing anything long term for my skin. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",
