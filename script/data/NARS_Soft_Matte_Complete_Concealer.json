I have very very oily skin so this matte formula doesn't separate or mix badly with my other skin routine products.\n\nA little goes a long way, even though it is expensive for a small product it will definitely last awhile if not used in excess but it depends on how often you wear makeup.",

Its wonderful for my undereye area corrector but its a bit to dry for covering darkness around my nose so lll use Glossier concealer pot. It's much more creamy. Alittle goes a long way w/ the mac pot. The mac pot does almost completely set like most matte products so keep that in mind when you're deciding how to apply. But bc it on the matte side it will cause creasing on mature or dry skin maybe even make flaked skin will look highlighted. I'd probably will stop using this in my late 30s or when I start forming fine lines. Bobbi Bown's new line might peak your interest if you have mature/dry skin type.",

Looks great on the skin. Doesn't fade throughout the day. Not sure why some are calling it dry. I have super dry skin and this is nowhere close to dry on me. Nars makes great concealer, so really no surprise that this product is phenomenal. Worth the price. Will repurchase, one of the best concealers for covering blemishes I have tried.

        "comments": "Concealers are difficult to get right, especially matte ones, since the finish can tend to exaggerate problems with the texture and look cakey when set with powder.  But NARS definitely delivers with this gorgeous pot concealer.  It applies smoothly and evenly with a concealer brush, melts into the skin (and your foundation) when pressed and warmed with your fingers but maintains its coverage, layers well with color-correcting creams (if desired), and lasts all day without significant creasing or settling into fine lines.  More impressively, it covers hyperpigmentation or acne blemishes with less product than most liquid or mousse concealers and without sheering out.  And it's easy to work with for graphic eye looks as well (see image below), such as cut lid or cut crease.\n\nBut be clear, this is a truly matte finish product.  If you prefer more dewy or illuminated finishes under the eye, this probably isn't the product for you.  I'll also say that the color selection isn't necessarily intuitive next to their foundation selection.  I'm very fair and cool-toned, and I wear the shade Mont Blanc in both the NARS All Day Luminous Foundation and the Sheer Glow Foundation, and either Finland or Terre Neuve in the Radiant Tinted Moisturizer, but I'm shade Vanilla (not Chantilly) in the concealer.  Matching the undertone is probably more important than the depth of the shade.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a matte concealer, this is an excellent option.",

It's great if you're using foundation over it but I was hoping based on other reviews that it would blend better and it just doesn't. I was looking for a concealer I could use randomly or even every day without additional support makeup, but this just falls short. It's pretty cakey compared to others but it does work... you just need to really cover it and focus on blending (or plan to use it all over your face so you can just get that \"I used way too much powder\" kind of look). Definitely not the OMG miracle others seem to claim that it is. For reference, I'm a certified esthetician and former makeup artist so I know how to use it... and it is the proper color match - it just isn't the best formula in my opinion.",
