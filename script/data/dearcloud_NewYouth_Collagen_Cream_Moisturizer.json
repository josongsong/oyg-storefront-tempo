After a terrible experience with La Roche-Posay, I stumbled across Dear Cloud, and it has been an absolute dream!\n\nThis moisturizer is lightweight, non-greasy, and perfectly hydrates my skin without feeling heavy. I love how smooth and comfortable it feels—so much so that I actually look forward to applying it every day. It absorbs beautifully, leaving my skin feeling soft, nourished, and balanced. If you have normal to dry skin and want something gentle yet effective, I highly recommend Dear Cloud!",

I can't really fault this product, nor say whether I recommend it, because combination skin is so tricky (needs something lightweight, but not TOO lightweight, etc). In my case, other than not being moisturizing enough in certain sensitive areas of my face, I don't think I noticed any changes (like more or less breakouts, and things like that) while using this. For me, this product was really just OK. So, I won't be repurchasing, since I've tried other products that have actually shown positive changes on my skin (but they were pricier *sobs*). That being said, for the price, I think this moisturizer is worth checking out. You never know, it might be the one for you! :)",

Ingredients looked like a lot of hub bub but figured it be worth trying it out given the price point. When applying i initially thought I needed more than necessary but a little goes a long way. once on my skin, it gives a very mineral oil heavy feeling sitting on top which within minutes is absorbed & goes away… still dont like it initially & if i have any sensitive areas like i just plucked my brows or popped a zit, the product will burn & irritate that spot for a bit… i havent really seen much of an improvement in my skin in fact i recently broke out on my chin but could be bc i changed a couple diffrrent products in my regime… this is just not for me, but can see it being an okay moisturizer if youre on a budget. I typically opt for cerave pm moiturizer for night & pca skin moisturizers for day time…",
