I have used many makeup removers over the years including Clinique Take the Day Off in both the liquid and solid formulas but the wipes are the way to go!  No cotton rounds needed or rubbing into the skin as you would with the solid formula.  Simple, gentle, effective and one wipe does the job.  Yes, they are more costly than a drugstore makeup remover wipe but for the quality and effectiveness this product is worth every penny!",

The first few sheets tend to stick together and come out in clumps, where I have to stuff them back in to save until next time. Small problem to overcome. It resolved itself after the first five or so sheets  being used made more room inside the package. \n\nI would definitely buy again. The convenience of flying with a package of towelettes instead of a bottle of liquid is excellent.",

Skin feels fresh and clean after use and there really is no need to rinse your face. My only complaints are that it's impossible to remove just one towel at a time. and you need to be careful to close the container tightly with the foil in place to prevent the towels drying out.",

When Clinique came out with these I was so thrilled to order them that I bought two boxes. I am not really happy. They are barely moist and I ended up pouring some of my Clinique toner into the package to wet them enough to remove makeup. They are hard to dispense and the lid does not close fully tight. I am keeping the foil disk that sealed the package on top of the opening to retain what toner and cleanser is within the container. I so wanted to like this product, but so far a no go. Maybe the second package won't be so dry. I hope not, but will not be ordering this again.",
