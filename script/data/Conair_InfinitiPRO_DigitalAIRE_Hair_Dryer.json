It's like using hurricane winds to dry your hair. For me this was expensive and a waste of money. I've missed the return window and no longer have the box so I'm stuck with it. \n\nIt is lightweight and compact which I like.",

At first it seemed ok but the shape of the dryer and the powdr of the dryer are mot great if you are trying to dry your hair all over. It causes my long thick hair to tangle horribly. I have to constantly stop and brush my hair out otherwsie it becomes so knotted and frizzy. I ise leave in conditioner and blow dry heat protection as well as a hair oil but nothing helps when i ise this dryer. It also only dried in small sections so you constantly have to move hair around or section it of very thoroughly in order to get your hair dried evenly. Its just too much work. I had a dryson dryer and an amika dryer before this and neither of those dryers gave me tangles and frizz like this one. On the pro side the cool button actually works well and the dryer isnt super loud.",

        "comments": "I sprang for this dryer for several reasons.  First, it's small and extremely lightweight, easy to use and handle.  Second, I'm older and my hair is even finer now than it used to be, and thinner.  I wanted a dryer that had a very low heat option and very low air flow.  This dryer fits what I need perfectly, and I feel it doesn't dry out my hair like my other dryers do even when on their low settings.  I like the separate switch for on/off.  The other buttons can be accidentally pushed as others have said...seems like the manufacturers could figure out a better placement of buttons.  However, I'm used to where they are and rarely push the buttons by accident.  It also seems like my hair dries faster with this dryer, even on low air/low heat.  I hope this dryer holds up for a long time, and I would buy it again I like it so much.",

The cool mode button on the back of this dryer is a useful feature too.\nThat being said, who decided the speed and heat button placement on this thing? They are right under pressure points on my hands regardless of which hand I use. They press down easily, which makes the dryer change settings mid-style. It's annoying, but not a deal breaker.",

While using it, you can (and do) accidentally increase the heat and/or air speed - or dramatically reduce either or both!  Did Quality Control not test this dryer before releasing it for sale?  For the price of this dryer, I would think something so simple should not be such an issue.  It dries hair quickly (while blowing it all around, resulting in tangles), and is super light and quiet, for the amount of air volume.  Not sure I'll be keeping this dryer.",

I went beyond my usual dry time and my hair was still damp. \n\nThe air force was so powerful that it tangled my hair and gave me knots. I spent too much time pausing to fix, and also lost more hair. \n\nThe buttons are terrible considering they're where your hands hold thr dryer. Once again, I had to keep pausing to readjust the settings. \n\nThe weight is the same as my regular, basic hair dryer. \n\nIt's too long, especially with the attachments. Maybe it's because I have l long arms, but it's just too long to be able to maneuver well. \n\nI'd give it half a star if I could, just for the fact my hair was less frizzy, but other than that I hated it.",

It's very little to no heat so it just doesn't dry well. The buttons are also in a terrible place where you continuously hit them making the settings change. Also, you have to reset each setting every time you turn the dryer off and on, the cord is so short and it's not very quiet.  It  tangled my hair so tight that it was hard to get them out and also made my hair look frazzled and frizzy. There isn't one good thing I can say about this dryer.",

Its air preassure is amazing. It gets nice and hot- but not too hot. The settings and design are beautiful and easy to use. It's fairly quiet( for a blowdryer). It dried my thick frizzy hair FAST- I did a bombshell blowout on myself NOT a sleek blowdry so cannot confirm how smoothing it is, but can see the potential when paired with the right product:) if you're on the fence just do it.

Feels just like one of those hand blowers in the bathroom, that's how powerful this is!  I can dry my hair and dust the bathroom all in the same shot!  You can turn the speed and the heat down if you want.  My hair is shoulder length doesn't take long to dry with this hair dryer at all!  There is even a cool shot button to press and it stays on you don't have to hold it down like on other dryers.  I came in from sweating to death outdoors and used the cool shot on full blast and that was so wonderful!  Cord is super long so that is also a plus.  As far as the attachments go.  I am not a professional so I don't really know how to use them properly. Directions were not very helpful.  But this is the best hair dryer I have ever used!  Believe me I have used a lot in my lifetime!  I feel like I'm using a professional one like my hair stylist uses.   I do hope this lasts a very long time!  Easy to take apart and clean out the filter if need be.  Has a little brush as well to help with that job.  Defiantly would buy this again, and even give as a gift.  I was going to take my old dryer and leave it in my luggage to take on trips, but I think I just might want this one with me.  It's just that great and I don't want to leave home without it!  If a hair dryer could be my new best friend, this one is it!",

        "comments": "I received the dryer free of charge to product test. I was excited to test it out after seeing all the benefits it claimed I would see. Unfortunately not everything it promised came to fruition, but let's start with the overall look and feel of the dryer. The color is really appealing and it is very sleek and stylish. It is lighter than I expected weight wise which I really liked.  I really liked the way it fit into my hands and I had no issues with the buttons being in the way of my grip like I have with other dryers. The diffuser is big and does a great job for it's function, but it felt kind of \"clunky\" to me. The cool air shot is actually COOL!! Most dryers claim its \"cool\" but we all know it's lukewarm at best. This dryer actually follows through with the cold! When it came to dry time it definitely did cut it down...but not by much. I will say I have very long thick hair so drying takes forever anyway, but this dryer didn't speed up the process by anything I would consider remarkable or game changing. It also states it helps cut down on frizz, but I really didn't see much of a difference between this and my older conair hair dryer. I still had to use products to tame the wild beast that is my hair. I do believe someone with finer hair would see a difference in the frizz aspect though. Overall I would definitely continue to use it but it didn't live up to the hype in my head.",
