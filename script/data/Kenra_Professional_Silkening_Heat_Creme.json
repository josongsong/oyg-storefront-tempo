Left completely natural, it looks like worn out steel wool that has started to unravel, feels like very thin straw, and seems to shed more than my corgi in summer. When flat ironed without product, it kind of just lays flat with no movement. So naturally, I've decided to try and grow it out shoulder length. My reviews are based on how products have helped or hindered that effort, and may not be applicable to your hair type. This product has been a God send!!!! There are certainly other heat protection treatments that are effective, but this one has done miracles for my hair. It is softer, smoother, silkier, and stronger. I've noticed a massive reduction in breakage.",

I put this on just before my hair is completely dry.  I section my hair into 3 parts.... left, right and back.  3 to 4 pumps per section. I have fine hair but a lot of it,  below my shoulders.  I have 2C to 3A hair and blow it straight most of the time. This stuff is amazing! (Once you figure out how much to use.)  My hair is super soft, straight, shiny and beautiful. Doesn't feel like there is anything in my hair. No stiffness or product flaking. Helps with humidity. \nI definitely recommend trying this product.",

I always need a couple of products, starting with a heat protectant serum then a smoothing serum and sometimes a leave in conditioner. When I used this silkening heat creme I was able to cut a bunch of hair products down to one amazing product. I am super happy with the results and will continue to use this every time I blow dry my hair in the future.",

        "comments": "I have type 4 hair with medium-coarse strand thickness and this didn't do much for me. \nWas it softening? Yes. \nDid it add shine? A little, but it didn't add much more than any other creamy/oily heat protectant. I also always use a serum afterwards that does a better job of adding shine anyway. \nDoes it smell badly? Not to me. I actually like the scent. It's fruity, but I can see how it might not mix with the scents of other products. It disappears pretty quickly anyway. \n\nI've used this product about 5 times sporadically and my issue with it is how quickly my hair puffed up every time I used it. It would barely last a day inside the house before it started getting mega volume and puffiness. I like that look, but I also care about the longevity of the style and don't want frizz in the first week, let alone the first day. My hair is decently resistant because of the coarseness and the fact that I don't mess up its integrity by doing crazy stuff to it or my scalp (no crazy/unstable DIY hair products with pH imbalances; no tight styles; no leaving my hair wet all day because that weakens the strength of the hair strands; I prevent my hair from tangling/matting; I clarify and exfoliate my scalp every wash; I keep my scalp clear of product, etc). Because of this and knowing how to use heat properly, I have been able to do back to back silk presses every 2-4 weeks and heat touch ups in between for the past year and a half with no curl loosening, so I guess I need to stick with heat protectants that have hold. \n\nWith that being said, I've used heat protectants without hold before and never had puffy hair that quickly. I feel the issue with this is the glycerin. Glycerin is a humectant and pulls moisture from the air into the hair. And with glycerin being the second ingredient, I think it attracted humidity to my hair and facilitated the puffiness. I feel like this is for people with thinner and straighter hair so they can have hair that's straight but not flat. Maybe this wouldn't be as bad for me to use during the winter, but there are other no hold, alcohol free heat protectants on the market that are cheaper and don't have glycerin.",
