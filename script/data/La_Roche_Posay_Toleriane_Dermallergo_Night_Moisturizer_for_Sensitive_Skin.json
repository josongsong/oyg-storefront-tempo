It is more of a gel moisturizer which may come off as sticky at first but absorbs quickly and moisturizes so well. I have the most sensitive skin on the planet and this mousturizer doesnt cause any flares or acne. I have been repurchasing for over 5 years and will continue to do so. Ive tried the day time version of this and its more of a lotion that doesnt act the same on my skin.  The bottle is effective as it squeezes the product like a vacuum seal as you use it. Please dont ever stop making this!!!",

My skin is pretty dry, but this seems to make a difference. I just wish it wasn't so expensive, and also the pump requires you to really shake it to get product out, even on the first pump of a brand new bottle. Not sure if I got a faulty pump on mine, but after shaking, I can get enough out.",
