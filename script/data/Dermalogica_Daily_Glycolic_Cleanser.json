This cleanser was a game changer. I got it on sale for half price and wish I had bought the bigger bottle. I use it daily, morning and night and find it doesn't dry out my skin (paired with a good lotion after of course), and reduces my breakouts remarkably. A year ago I was too self conscious of my acne to leave the house without makeup, now I love that I can. It has also helped to tighten my pores, brighten dark spots/scarring from acne, and generally just make my skin look and feel fresh and radiant.",

I struggle with adult acne and recently have been breaking out more than usual after returning home from traveling (likely a combination of changing temps + wearing a mask on a plane and in Ubers). This cleanser has been SO helpful in rebalancing my skin. I love that it's gentle enough to use daily, and it helps exfoliate and purge my skin of all the harsh environmental factors. In just a week or two I have seen a marked difference in the brightness, tone, and texture of my skin. The ONLY thing I dislike about this product is the pump - if you push even a bit too hard you will end up with way more product than needed, which can lead to waste. But if you push gently you can likely get the right amount out. Other than that, excellent product and I love the results!",

I agree that this is gentle enough for daily use but I don't find that it makes a noticeable difference in the brightness of my skin. It's an OK cleanser but probably not one I would gravitate towards again. I also wish the spout of the dispenser was a bit longer because it can be hard to dispense the product properly unless I tilt the bottle.",
