When my previous dryer finally died on me, I was super bummed. I was so surprised when this same model was available, I immediately snatched it up! I love the different heat levels, love the cooling feature, superior air flow, it really is the perfect dryer. Especially for the price point. HIGHLY recommend!",

Ridiculous to pay this much for something untrustworthy.",

It stopped working last week. For a dryer of this price to break in under a year is ridiculous. While I did like it better than the cheaper Conair dryer I used to use, it's not justifiable at this price point, especially considering my cheap Conair dryer lasted 5 years while this didn't even last one. I've used BabyLiss for straighteners as well, which seem to hold up just fine, but I would not recommend their dryers.",

I tried the Dyson Supersonic for a few years until it stopped working and I never liked how my hair looked while using it. I figured that the reason I disliked how my hair looked was due to my aging hair (I'm 62 with a lot of hair that is also frizzy and wavy, in a butterfly cut) along with my chosen round brush and products. I use Aveda haircare products. I even tried the SRI DryQ dryer for about 10 months til that stopped working. I decided to give this dryer another try after researching dryers and reviews and I am so happy I did!! I love my hair again!!! Same products, same round brush and technique. With this dryer, my hair is smooth, soft, shiny and straight and dried so quickly. I will never switch to a different dryer again. This is the one! And I no longer have to plan around freshly washed and styled hair days, since it now looks great on day1 not having to wait for that 2nd/3rd day good hair day.",

I was overwhelmed when that one broke and I needed to find a replacement. There are so many on the market now! Since I know the difference in quality of hair appliances DOES make the hair healthier and save time, I decided to go a step higher in the hairdryer options this time. I initially bought a T3. Not a bad dryer but I didn't see the $200 difference. I read that brand's reviews to find it had durability and warranty issues so I returned it. On to the next option...\n\nThe 'salon' I go to is a high end beauty school. They not only sell Babyliss appliances but all the students are taught with their entry level model dryer. I saw this one on special with much better reviews so I gave it a try. I picked this one over their other model with a Ferrari motor, no joke! A new Ulta store has a tester section for hair appliances in their store and compared to even more expensive dryers, it seems the most powerful and easy to use of Ulta's dryer choices. \n\nAll I can say is I am pleased! Money well spent and my hair looks great in top drytime speed, even a couple days after initially styling. And I can forgo the 'secondary' appliance styling--that is the real test! I hope this one lives up to its durability because it is a great dryer worth every single penny.\n\nOne note is that the diffusers could fit a bit more snug. Not an issue to affect the quality but I am rough on my equipment and like to store mine in the drawer ready for use and it might come off or loosen more than I'd like.",

I unpacked it from my suitcase and saw the rear filter screen is missing. The plastic frame is still attached to the dryer but the filter screen is gone and I have no idea where it is. This is a huge disappointment to me because I have never paid so much money for a hair dryer before and I really do love the power of it and how my hair looks afterward. Even though I have taken very good care of this dryer and it is almost brand new, I would even be willing to buy a replacement rear filter, but there is no replacement filter for this model on the Babyliss website. Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed that I spent so much money on a hair dryer and it is already falling apart.",
