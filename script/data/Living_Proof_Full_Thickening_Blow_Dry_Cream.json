I love that there's a heat protectant in this product so that cuts down the need to use an additional product. I applied a small amount (I have very long hair and was surprised at how far the small amount I used went) to damp, towel dried hair. I used a blow dry brush to give myself a blow out, my hair looked so much more full when I was done. It kept its great body all day! The next day I curled my hair as I normally do and my curls had a nice bounce to them! My favorite thing about this product was it didn't weight my hair down at all. Now I get why my mom is so obsessed with this line! I received this product complimentary from living proof in exchange for my honest review.",

The Thickening Blow-Dry Cream was not a good match for my hair type.\n\nThe product did not work well with my hair—it left it feeling weighed down. \nIt wasn't appealing to me; it smelled terrible to me. This is something that might be more of a personal preference than a flaw in the product itself, but I wasn't a fan of it either way.\n\nI would not recommend this product if you have thin, fine hair like mine because it will probably leave your hair feeling weighed down, and not at all volumized. If you have thicker or curlier hair types, then it might work better for you!",
