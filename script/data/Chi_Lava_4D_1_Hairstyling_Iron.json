        "headline": "First Flat Iron I've liked in 15 years",
        "comments": "I was hesitant at first to try this since there was barely any reviews and there were two not so positive on this site. I'm glad I purchased it because it's been my first positive experience with a flat iron in 15 years. I purchased two within that time. One being 200+ and the other around the same price range. Both different brands. Each left me frustrated with poor results, snagging, and the dreaded hair straightener smell from the 00's. I stopped using each after a week and quickly gave them away. \n\nI have 2B/2C curls. I am absolutely not a flat iron person. I learned how to round brush 15 years ago and I've gone that route for straightening and most of my styling since. In addition, I love curling irons and wands, but I've always admired a certain type of curl people got from flat irons. I could never replicate this until I used this.\n\n This flat iron has made it a simple task for me to curl my hair. I've tried different types of curls with it and it has all been a pretty seamless, easy process. \n\nAs for straightening, it works well when you section off your hair. I had flat, shiny hair with lots of movement. The first time I tried it, I lazily did it by not sectioning and just went at it. I got decent results - it was straight and not poofy but my hair did not enough movement. \n\nThe smell. So far, I've been pleasantly surprised to achieve the results by not maxing out the heat and not getting that crazy hair straightner smell. It's one thing I do not miss.\n\nWeight. I saw someone mention this. Yes, it is a little heavier than other straighteners but tbh, it's no heavier than your average long barrel wand or curl iron. Definitely not as heavy as most hair dryers. I personally find it comfortable and not bulky. If you've ever held a GHD flat iron, it is basically the same weight and bulk. \n\nHair snag. NONE. I have had none! I'm very happy about this.\n\nThe outer plates? I'm not sure how much help they provide. Possibly they do since I can curl my hair? They don't seem to be heated plates like the inner plates, so do not worry about accidentally melting your skin off. They do get hot. To add, the lock is very nice for storage and curling.\n\nAll in all, I'm very happy with this purchase! I would recommend trying this.",

It straightens super smooth, but I also love that I can use it to curl my hair too. My hair looks shiny and feels soft every time I use it. Definitely one of the best flat irons I've owned!",
