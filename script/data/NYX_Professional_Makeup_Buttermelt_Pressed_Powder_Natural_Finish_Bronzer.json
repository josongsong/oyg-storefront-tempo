After a couple of days of using this, my cheekbones and forehead began to break out and become incredibly bumpy. Another con about this product is its smell. For me, I could deal with the smell, but was not the biggest fan, as it smelled very chemically.\n\nOverall, if you are a acne prone girly like me, I would stay away from this product, or try another bronzer before trying this.",

When choosing your shade, don't go by how it looks in the pan. The container's color is actually a more accurate representation if you can't swatch it and are struggling to decide which one is for you. I would definitely recommend these as a budget-friendly option for bronzer.",

I wanted golden glow, not \"I forgot to put my sunscreen on.\" I hope other ladies have a better time than I did. But as far as I can tell, these are blushes and not bronzers.",
