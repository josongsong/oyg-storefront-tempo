        "comments": "I should have written this review a long time ago, but here it is.  My son was struggling with acne that covered most of his face.  We went to see a dermatologist, and of course, they recommended and put him on a certain medication that starts with the letter A( that the filter will not allow me to type in this review. ) After 2 months of seeing what that medication was doing to my son (please research warnings/side effects before putting your child on this) I stopped the medication and searched for a new skin care line to try.  I purchased this cleanser and the face moisturizer to go with it.  I made sure my son used both products morning and night every single day.  Literally, within a couple weeks, his skin was clearing up beautifully.  After a month of use, he had a completely clear, beautiful complexion.  He received complements regularly on how great his skin looked.  It's been 2 years since I purchased our first Jack Black facial products and to this day, my son's skin is flawless. My husband and other son also use JB products.  In my opinion, Jack black products are very cost effective, considering how long they last and how well they work.  I'm not saying it works for everyone, just saying that if you are at the point of considering Acc-----, give this a try first!",

My husband is not one to use anything on his face or hands.Once he tried the cleanser after encouragement as I love skin care products, he was hooked. Within in a short period of time, his skin was brighter and he really enjoyed washing his face in the morning, said it was refreshing. He has now expanded his Jack Black products to about everything they offer. He is 69 and his skin looks 10 years younger. He uses his products faithfully now taking a little time for himself and everyone in the family can see the results. Now when special holidays come along, we know what he wants and there are many things to choose from.",

So, I decided to buy this product and so far his skin looks clearer and has a clearer complexion compared to before, he has oily and combination skin so for those that have the same skin type might need to follow up with a good moisturizer in the chin area because he says he tends to get more dryer there, probably because that area is more sensitive from the shaving. But, overall it is a good product and I have no complaints about it.",
