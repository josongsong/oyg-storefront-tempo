I only give it four stars because it has a slight sunscreen smell. It doesn't bother me too much, but it's definitely there. Also it sits perfectly under makeup and makes it look FLAWLESS!!",

I often mix it with a couple drops of foundation and it creates an amazing glowy base. I can layer concealer under or over it without pilling, my main issue with other products. In the summer I do find I have to set my T zone with powder, but I would do that with any foundation. also the packaging is great at getting out every drop. Im turning 30 soon and I think my skin looks great for my age and has very few fine lines, I largely credit the SPF in this product.",

I liked it so much I ordered a full size and will likely keep it as my AM moisturizer of choice! It has good skincare benefits in addition to the spf, and i find it goes on nicely and absorbs well without any white cast or pilling. Its also very hydrating. Its true that you need to use a lot to get the full spf benefits, but this is true for any spf. It is a heavier moisturizer, and i do find that if i dont follow it with a healthy amount of setting powder, ill look greasy. I imagine if you have dry skin, though, this would look very nice and dewy. For me, the setting powder does the trick, and the moisturizer wears nicely under my powder foundation too. Ive also has no irritation or breakouts from it. Overall, its a win for me!",

At first I was worried that this would leave a white cast on my dark skin but I just took about 30 minutes to blend it in and it looked great! The cap feature is pretty cool too. As I learn more about sunscreen I realized the likelihood that I'm using less than the effective amount. The cap actually measures out to the perfect amount! I love it!",

I purchased this based on reviews but found it to be too thick for my skin type and no matter what foundation I applied afterwards, my makeup always broke down from using this moisturizer. The dew factor is definitely there, but even a light application of this moisturizer caused my makeup to become an oily, slick mess. There were days I would apply the moisturizer just on its own when I didn't want to wear makeup and needed some SPF but I could still sense the smell of this product on me. It's not heavily fragranced, but just has an SPF smell to it. Personally, I didn't find it to suit my skin needs and will not repurchase or can recommend from my experience.",
