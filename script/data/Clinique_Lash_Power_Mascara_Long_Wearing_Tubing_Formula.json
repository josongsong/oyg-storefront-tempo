I have very oily skin and am very sweaty, so I always used waterproof mascara. But even that would smudge and smear by the end of a work day or night out. I never have that problem with tubing mascara. It's seriously like a miracle. The ONLY downside is that if you have straight lashes (which I do), you will have to curl them before AND after application. However, I have tried several tubing mascaras now, and Lash Power is by far the best at holding a curl! Even Clinique's High Impact Curling Mascara (also a tubing formula) doesn't hold the curl as well as this one does. They pulled Lash Power out of stores a few months ago to do a reformulation and I entered full on panic mode. I have been stalking their instagram and harassing them on Twitter to get a re-release date AND IT'S FINALLY BACK. Get this mascara. You won't regret it.",

This is probably the saddest formula I have ever used in a mascara. The brush is so delicate it basically does nothing to apply the mascara to the lashes. It coars them, however offers zero benefit. You may as well go get a lash tint and walk out of the house sans mascara.  That is all this does. Tint. The wand and brush are cheap and it has zero weight making it feel strange applying the product- usually the handle has some sort of weight. There is no traction on the brush when applying. No lift, no seperation... Nada.  Not a tubing mascara either as the girls in the store suggested it is. All around fail.",
