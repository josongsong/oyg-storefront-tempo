The balm has a very natural looking, it has a  hint of color that looks like the color of baby lips. Not a dark or overly bright. I did however notice that with one application it looks very natural but if i do more layers it definitely builds up to a more visible color of the balm color you choose. You cant go wrong with this lip balm. Packaging is feel like quality, has a magnetic closer and the tube feel heavy and fancy. Its a win win in every way.",

My 1st thoughts were how pretty the color was and 2nd it's a little pricey. Aren't they basically all the same? I was actually wrong and ended up falling for this stuff. The magnetic cap is so addictive and satisfying. And when you put it on it's not sticky feeling at all. I wore it daily for last couple weeks to give it a real test and discovered that when it wears off you're not left with that tight dry lip feeling you get from most other lip products even some chapsticks can leave you with. And your lips just feel well.... nice! Even my 6 year old tried it a few times and kept trying to take off with it lol. I can see treating myself and buying it when I'm out and can def say I recommend it. I rely on reviews so much when buying stuff so I really hope this helps someone out even just a little bit. Thanks and best wishes!",

I really wish I loved this item, but at best I give it 2.5 stars, it's just really nothing special. I tried this balm in 002 cosmic crystal and on my lips this balm has zero color/pigment, it does look beautiful in the tube and I like the slight sparkle it leaves on the lips (which is really only visible up close, but does give your lips a nice look even from far away). My biggest issue with this product is that it wasn't really moisturizing at all for me, the photos on the site show a very glossy look and this balm was not glossy at all on my lips or when swatched on my hand.\nI feel like maybe these balms are better in the deeper shades, so you at least get some color payoff. These very much feel and smell like lipstick to me without the color payoff, so for a balm I just didn't think it held up to expectations. I will say the case is beautiful, it has a nice heft to me and I like the color/shape of the tube. I wish I could rate this higher but it just wasn't for me, there are better balms out their on the market in all price ranges. \n\nI did receive this item free of charge in exchange for my honest review; my opinions and views of this product are my own and we're not incentivized.",
