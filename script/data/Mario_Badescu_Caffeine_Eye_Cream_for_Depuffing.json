        "comments": "Pros: a tiny amount of product goes a long way, it works well on my super-sensitive skin, moisturizes well\nCons: after a month of daily use, my opinion is that it doesn't de-puff the under eye area at all. I even tried only applying under one eye a few times just to compare results. No difference! Also the jar design is misleading, inside has a false bottom so you're not getting as much product as the outer appearance of the jar might lead you to believe. Will I use this product up? Yes, because it does moisturize nicely. Would I buy it again? No, because it doesn't de-puff at all. And that's what I really want - a product to de-puff and firm my under eye area.",

However, I know a couple of people who say they can't use it because it burns their eyelids, which really surprised me! For me personally, it is the only eye cream that my eyelids have actually been able to stand. I cannot comment on the puffiness reduction because that is not an issue of mine.",

I use it every morning and sometimes mid-day when I'm feeling tired. It's more of a cooling sensation than a tingling for me. It's very refreshing, and a little goes a long way.",

I even tried only applying under one eye a few times just to compare results. No difference! Also the jar design is misleading, inside has a false bottom so you're not getting as much product as the outer appearance of the jar might lead you to believe. Will I use this product up? Yes, because it does moisturize nicely. Would I buy it again? No, because it doesn't de-puff at all. And that's what I really want - a product to de-puff and firm my under eye area.",
