  "details": "DetailsBenefitsHelps accelerate skin cell turnoverAssists in plumping and firming the skinImproves the appearance of fine lines and wrinklesHelps to regulate sebum productionEWG VERIFIEDKey IngredientsBakuchiol: A natural alternative to retinol derived from the Psoralea Corylifolia (Babchi) plant. It has been shown to have similar effects as retinol, without irritation. Helps to reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and uneven skin tone.Apple Fruit Stem Cell Extract (Malus Domestica Fruit Stem Cell Extract): Signals your own skin stem cells. It also combats the appearance of aging and deep wrinkles. Topical application has been shown to reduce the appearance of crow's feet wrinkles with daily use.Formulated WithoutSulfates: DIME products never contain skin irritating ingredients such as sulfates. Sulfate-free products are gentle on the skin, and can help decrease the chances of an allergic reaction.Parabens: Certain parabens have been linked to hormone disruption. DIME prohibits all parabens, including Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Isopropylparaben, Methylparaben, and Propylparaben.Fragrance: DIME never uses any form of fragrance, natural or synthetic, in any facial skincare products.Phthalates: Certain phthalates (like Dibutyl Phthalate, aka DBP, or DEHP, and DEP) appear on product labels, but most typically remain unlisted, hiding under the term “fragrance.” Since some phthalates have been linked to hormone disruption, DIME avoids them.Item 2603233How To UseDue to its exfoliation blend and high hydrational and repair properties, it is best to work through the night vs being disrupted by the day's free radicals.

My skin kept getting worse, but I hoped it'd turn around. After almost a year of using their products my skin is dryer and has more wrinkles. It also made me breakout and I rarely have breakouts. I have dry/sensitive skin. This wasn't for me.",

        "comments": "I recently purchased Dime DBT Cream, but I'm quite disappointed with the changes in its ingredients. After comparing the product's box and the website, it's clear that the ingredients listed are significantly different. One notable change is that Bakuchiol, which used to be a key ingredient, is now listed near the bottom of the ingredients list. Meanwhile, VP Copolymer, which was previously much lower, is now near the top. This shift raises concerns about the formulation and effectiveness of the product. I'm a little frustrated that the ingredients have changed without clear communication or transparency. If you're someone who trusted the original formulation, be cautious and do your research before purch",
