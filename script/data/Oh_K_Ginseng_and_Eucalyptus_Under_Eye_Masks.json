I keep them in a mini fridge which made them feel absolutely amazing when i put them on. These are very comfortable to wear and don't slide around. I almost forgot I was wearing them. Besides being cold from the fridge, there was a colling sensation from I'm guessing the eucalyptus in these. It immediately calmed down the itchiness and swelling under my eyes. I am going to stock up on these for sure!",
