Maybe it has helped prevent more age spots but with nothing to compare it to, I don't notice it.   It has really helped with wrinkles.   The fine wrinkles at the corner of my eyes and above my lip are much less obvious and the deep wrinkles can be seen but they feel so much less deep.   I think it works great on wounds that are slow in healing as well.   Keep in mind that it takes years to see a big difference.   I didn't see any major change in my deep wrinkles for at least a year, I could feel a difference but not really see a difference.   I will continue to use it as I really believe in it and the impact it as on my aging skin.  I am in my 60s and have fair skin.",

I go to the dermatologist, and have everything from Retina, Tazorac, special cleansers, and sulfar-based lotions (for those of you familiar with dermatologist products). I was so desperate to get rid of my scarring, that I decided to try this to even my skin tone and lighten my scars. WOW! Im only on DAY 4, and my scars are already 35% better! Everyone around me, after DAY 2, started complimenting me on how good my skin looked! (and I wasnt wearing any makeup)\n\nThe routine I started:(NIGHTLY, after evening cleanse)\nI get a facecloth and soak it under hot water. I ring out the excess water, then place the towel on my face to open my pores. I quickly pat my face dry with a seperate towel, and then apply the oil generously. I resoak the towel in steaming hot water, squeeze out all the excess water again, and place it on my face (now that the oil is on) and let it steam my face and open my pores to let the oil seep into my skin. When the towel has lost its heat, I do this a second time. Then, I leave my skin AS IS. Let it dry naturally, so that as my pores close up and any leftover oil on the surface remains on the surface or closes into my pores.",

The first 3 days was fine, smell was a little strong for me but I was determined to use this 2 times a day and see awesome results like everyone seems to be saying. Well about the 4th day I noticed a rash on my stomach and 5th day noticed it spread brown on the front of my legs and all the way down to feet. Rash also spread around to back of legs and back of knees, & HOLY COW !!!!  I had no idea what it was and it kept getting worse and itchy and spreading. The only thing different I could figure out was the oil, and the rash is only in the spots where I applied the oil. I thought... huh, no way! Well, upon further reviews I found a huge group of people describing red itchy bumps that appeared after a few days of use also. So user beware, try on a patch of skin for 4 days or so and see how your skin reacts to the oil. So disappointed people didn't even comment on some of these major sites about some negative things. So please test before using on a large area, especially since I normally never have sensitive or problem skin. Have not used in about 4 days and the rash is still really red, bumpy and spreading, hoping it goes away quickly.",
