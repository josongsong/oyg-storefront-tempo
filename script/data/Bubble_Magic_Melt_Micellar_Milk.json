It doesn't have an offensive odor, and initially I liked that it has a pump. However, the pump top broke about 60% of the way through the bottle. It does remove makeup, but not with fingers and water alone. I have to wet a cotton pad or use a cloth to remove it or my makeup won't come off all the way. I know I'm using it properly, so it's not user error. I don't appreciate the extra steps or the broken pump. I'll stick with my garnier water pink cap.",

The micellar milk effectively melts away makeup and impurities without the need for harsh rubbing. Its creamy, milky texture feels soothing on the skin, and it effortlessly lifts dirt and makeup, including waterproof mascara. After application, my skin feels clean, refreshed, and surprisingly hydrated, with no tightness or residue left behind. The gentle, nourishing formula is ideal for my sensitive skin, leaving it calm and balanced. Incorporating this micellar milk into my daily regimen has made makeup removal a much more pleasant and efficient process.",

        "comments": "This is an oily milk with a medium runny consistency that kinda reminds me of white school glue, but with more slip. It doesn't have an offensive odor, and initially I liked that it has a pump. However, the pump top broke about 60% of the way through the bottle. It does remove makeup, but not with fingers and water alone. I have to wet a cotton pad or use a cloth to remove it or my makeup won't come off all the way. I know I'm using it properly, so it's not user error. I don't appreciate the extra steps or the broken pump. I'll stick with my garnier water pink cap.",
