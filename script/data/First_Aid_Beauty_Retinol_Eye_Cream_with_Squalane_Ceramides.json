I will say the product burned the first & second time using it, like a tingling sensation, but it didn't cause any redness or irritation besides that feeling.

I only used it that one time and put it back in the box.  Hoping I can return it. I'm back to using the little bit I have left of their old formula and have NO issues with that one.",

        "comments": "I can't get enough of eye creams, especially the older I get. Recently I was able to try a First Aid Beauty Retinol Eye Cream With Squalane and Ceramides complimentary from First Aid Beauty for my honest review. I already was a huge fan of FAB and am now even more so! This retinol eye cream is designed for sensitive skin, so it's great for all skin types! I love this as retinol can be harsh, so having one for sensitive skin, you know it's gentle! ⛑️\n\nI'm an avid retinol user who has really dry skin, so I have to be careful and watch my skin as many can make my dry skin worse. This FAB Retinol Eye Cream is so gentle, yet powerful and not only hydrates but also smooths my fine lines, wrinkles and crows feet. I don't deal with any flaking, irritation or dryness. It contains encapsulated retinol which slowly releases the retinol, making it less harsh for skin. ⛑️\n\nThe squalane and ceramides help to hydrate, soothe, calm and strengthen my skins moisture barrier. I've always been a fan of First Aid Beauty for their cruelty free, clean and dermatologist tested skincare. As always I am impressed with this retinol eye cream as it not only battles my fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes, but also hydrated and soothes my skin so well at the same time. ⛑️\n\nMy skin soaks this right up and stays hydrated. I'm really loving using this during these colder months as usually this is when retinols can irritate my eyes more. This eye cream is the perfect addition to my all FAB skincare routine! ⛑️",
