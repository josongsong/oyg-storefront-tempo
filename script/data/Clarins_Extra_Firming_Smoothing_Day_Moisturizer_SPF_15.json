Though there was an adjustment period for my skin (combination/slightly sensitive & acne prone/huge pores). During this adjustment period I did get a blemish or two but I'm also prone to that anyway when trying a new product. However after I was adjusted, I can use it whenever without any issue. It makes my skin SO SOFT and my skin feels hydrated but not greasy. A little goes a long way. The smell is fantastic and not overwhelming. Be sure to learn the correct way to apply this product and you'll have no disappointment.",

        "comments": "I am a skincare junkie and have had a regular skincare routine for probably the last 15 years. I am very particular about the products I use and if I don't see my skin reaping the benefits, out goes the product. So in comes @Clarins, a brand known for having great ingredients with great products. I have never used any of their moisturizers though, until now. Just like many other products I have tried in the name of skincare, I will review it in hopes that it will help others make that important purchase to keep their skin looking years younger!\r\n\r\nAs many of you already know (and if you don't, you should), your moisturizer is the final step in your skincare routine, but before primer, if you use one. Today, and for the next 3 weeks, Clarins #Extra-Firming #Day #Cream is that final step for me. \r\n\r\nDay 1: It felt pretty thick going on but it spread out very nicely and soaked right in. I always wait a few minutes to let it soak in before putting on primer. Had no issues at all with feeling it on my face. That's a good thing because I'm not a woman who likes to put on moisturizer during my morning skincare routine. I don't like them generally because I usually feel them on my face. I did put a majority of the lotion on my cheeks, where I'm the most dry, and spread it more thinly around the rest of my face. The next day I can honestly say my face look brighter, smoother and tighter.\r\n\r\nDay 3: Put on a little too much. Don't know why I thought I needed to try a little more than the first time. A little too much is shown in the Photo. All it takes is a pea sized amount. A little goes a long way.\r\n\r\nI went to their website to look at the creams and found some videos about how to apply their lotion, #ClarinsApplicationMethod, and I have been using their method from about Day 5 until now. It helps it to sink in and is a good reminder to get your neck and to be gentle. \r\n\r\nI waited as long as I could to review this moisturizer because I really wanted to know how well it works. I have had absolutely no adverse reactions, only good looking skin. I am not kidding when I say that by the next day of using this moisturizer, my skin was more even toned and brighter. After 2 weeks of using my skin was noticeably smoother. Impressed is an understatement. I have stopped using foundation. I have just been using my favorite primer with a little blush. I am truly impressed and give this product a definite 5 stars. This moisturizer is a staple that I don't want to be without. If one of my friends wanted to bet on this product, with me betting they could change their skin for the better, making it brighter, more even toned and smoother, I would definitely take them up on it. \r\n\r\n#gotitfree #complimentary #sample #review #skincare #Clarins #moisturizer #firming #smoothskin",

        "comments": "I was given a free  sample of this cream to trial as part of a contest in term for an honest and unbiased review. \r\nNow that that's out of the way...I managed to squeeze out enough of the Clarins Cream for a full 2 week trial.  I feel this is an ample amount of time to test the effects of skin care products realistically.  I liked some aspects of the cream,  namely the SPF 15 factor of it as well as the richness of the cream itself,  although I did find that repeat application was necessary in the course of the day.  For all those wondering about SPF, it's the stuff more commonly found in your sunscreen products and its what helps to minimize sun damage (wrinkles) on your skin.  Any worthy skin care product contains this,  so Clarins Extra Firming Day Cream scores points for that. \r\nWhat I didn't like,  and found very hard to get past,  is the smell.  It was very off putting to me and almost caused me to stop the trial.  After a couple days I started using my normal skin serum first,  which cut down on the smell and made it tolerable.  I would much rather see an unscented line of this cream than subject myself to the smell again. The other thing I really didn't like was that it seemed to wear off quickly.  I started having dry patches of skin a couple hours after applying and had to reapply,  something I don't normally do unless I'm working out and sweating it off. \r\nI have to say that,  for the money this cream costs,  it's just not worth it.  It was okay,  but so is Olay at a quarter of the cost.  I would not purchase or recommend purchase at the current price.",
