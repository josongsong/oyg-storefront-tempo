It does break easily after a couple tries but the most frustrating part is that the entire pencil comes out!! I came out multiple times if I turned it upside down. Before you say \"Well don't turn it upside down\" even if i titled it slighty the entire pencil falls. Compact and packing is terrible! Back to the lab!",

        "comments": "Would have given this five stars but I wish the texture was a little harder/more waxy. It's way too soft and too easy to apply too much and it's impossible to get fine hair like strokes out of this. Having the spoolie on one end does help to blend it out but it's hard to be precise because this pencil just smears. It also feels like either it retracts a lot when I use it or I'm using it up that fast. The color is a perfect cool dark tone that is great on black/brown brows. I don't need much but this would be great if you need to draw on brows.",

I like to research reviews when it comes to the beauty and skincare industry …..while I've used Morphe plenty of times  I've never used their eye pencil.  Through trial and error I fell in  love with a drugstore brand and I've been using it for 3 years.  I had no problem with this product  I loved it….   So   on a whim  whilst killing time before a movie  I was giving myself a mini makeover at Ulta  when I tried on Morphe's micro eyebrow pencil in Chocolate Mousse.  The  thing that drew me to the display was the color options you all offer for eyebrows.  That's something you don't see with the drugstore brands. Anyway  my eyebrows had never looked so natural  the color was just right. I have black hair  so I use black eye pencil  because the  dark brown option was too light.  This Morphe shade  the precision of the pencil  and the brands reputation were all factors when I decided this would be my new eyebrow pencil…Unfortunately  like with all great products  the masses beat me too it  they were sold out of my color ….   As soon as I got home I ordered  a few of them from your website  I can't wait to receive it. Oh yes and it's reasonably priced  I'd  have no problem paying double for this brand and these results.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",

This is brown. There is no ifs, ands or buts about it. BROWN. I'm so disappointed since I thought it would be the perfect eyebrow pencil. I do like the formula for creating more realistic feathery brows but it's so clearly the wrong color for black hair that there's really no using it.",
