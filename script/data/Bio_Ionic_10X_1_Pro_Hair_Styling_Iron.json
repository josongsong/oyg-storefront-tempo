        "comments": "[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I have long, straight hair to about the middle of my back. Color and heat damage make it frizzy and not hold curl very well without high heat. Even though I wear my hair straight, I like to use a flat iron to smooth the frizzies. This tool heats up very quickly. 0 to 450 in about 47 seconds. I used on 3 different temp settings to see best results. Anything under 450 did not seem to make any difference to my hair. Using it to smooth at 450 and give a slight under curl, took a few swipes per 1 inch chunk. I have slightly thick hair so I can say, it was slightly time consuming to continously swipe each stand multiple times. It did come with a heat glove which made it easy to handle the product and the hair while styling. I don't like to use much product, so without the use of smoothing or glossing products with this iron, I don't think it did much to my hair. I do believe thinner hair with less color or heat damage may have better results. I tried to do curls and waves with the tool and they did not come out nicely. They were kinky and didn't last. While it didn't work for my hair, I cannot say it wouldn't for other styles or lengths.",

It's incredibly lightweight and ergonomically designed, making it super comfortable to use especially during longer styling sessions. It heats up quickly and offers a wide range of temperature settings, which is perfect for customizing based on your hair type. One of my favorite features is the auto shutoff. As someone who constantly second-guesses whether I've turned off my styling tools, this gives me serious peace of mind. I have naturally wavy, thin, fine, and color-treated hair, so I typically stick to lower heat settings. This styler handles that beautifully. It's versatile enough to straighten or curl, which adds so much value. The vibrating plates were a new experience for me—while they don't glide quite as smoothly on my hair as the non-vibrating mode, the results are still impressive.",

There's even a thumb indent for better grip—small touch, big difference.\nIt heats up in under 60 seconds (yes, really!) and automatically shuts off after an hour. As someone who constantly panics about leaving my styler on and burning the house down, this feature is a lifesaver.\nBut what truly sets it apart? The Sonic Vibrating Pads. They evenly distribute heat, smooth the hair in fewer passes, and leave a high-shine finish that looks like I just stepped out of a salon. It's fast, safe, and leaves my hair looking healthy—not fried",

I love that I can adjust the temperature to suit my hair, giving me full control over the heat I need. My hair feels so smooth, sleek, and perfectly straight after using it, and it works just as beautifully for soft waves too. The sonic vibrating plates glide effortlessly through my hair, leaving it polished and shiny in no time. Plus, I appreciate that it protects my hair's natural moisture while styling. It truly a game-changer for smooth, healthy-looking hair!",

This 10x styler is my favorite because it has the perfect size for reaching some areas of my hair that wouldn't be possible with a thicker straightener. I love the vibrating feature and also that it has a long cord.",

Honestly, is my new favorite iron.\nFirst off, I love how quickly it heats up, in just 60 seconds, it's ready to go, which is a huge time saver on those rushed mornings. \nMy hair doesn't just go straight it comes out super soft, with incredible shine, and feels way more hydrated than with other flat irons. \nNow, the frizz, it's basically non-existent! The sonic vibrating plates smooth my hair in a much more even way, so I don't have to go over the same section multiple times. This results in a polished, frizz-free finish that looks super pretty.\nWhat's also impressive is that despite the high heat (up to 400°F), it doesn't leave my hair dry or damaged, on the contrary, it actually helps keep my hair hydrated thanks to the Ion Generating Mineral Complex while I style.\nAnd let's not forget how easy it is to handle with its 9ft swivel cord and curved design, it's perfect for both sleek straight styles and soft waves. It's like having a professional-quality tool right at home, definitely this is a must.",

Color and heat damage make it frizzy and not hold curl very well without high heat. Even though I wear my hair straight, I like to use a flat iron to smooth the frizzies. This tool heats up very quickly. 0 to 450 in about 47 seconds. I used on 3 different temp settings to see best results. Anything under 450 did not seem to make any difference to my hair. Using it to smooth at 450 and give a slight under curl, took a few swipes per 1 inch chunk. I have slightly thick hair so I can say, it was slightly time consuming to continously swipe each stand multiple times. It did come with a heat glove which made it easy to handle the product and the hair while styling. I don't like to use much product, so without the use of smoothing or glossing products with this iron, I don't think it did much to my hair. I do believe thinner hair with less color or heat damage may have better results. I tried to do curls and waves with the tool and they did not come out nicely. They were kinky and didn't last. While it didn't work for my hair, I cannot say it wouldn't for other styles or lengths.",
