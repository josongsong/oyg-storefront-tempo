I thought the shade was darker when I saw it because it says terracota but it looks just perfect!! As you can see, it has an amazing pigmentation, you only need a little bit of product and application is so easy🥰 It has a pleasant scent which I enjoyed, it is very light so don't worry about strong fragrances\n\nIt has a glowing finish, I didn't need to apply highlighter afterwards, it looks BEAUTIFUL✨ and the best part, lasted all day long looking pretty and without looking cakey or cracked ✅\n\nI need more shades!

        "comments": "The NYX Cosmetics Buttermelt Blush has made a splash in the beauty community, promising a \"buttery soft\" powder formula with high pigmentation and long-lasting wear. As a staple in the affordable makeup category, it's a product that has generated a lot of buzz. But does it live up to the hype? Here's a comprehensive review to help you decide.\n​Texture & Application\n​One of the most notable features of this blush is its unique texture. Despite being a powder, it feels incredibly creamy and smooth to the touch, which is likely due to its formulation with mango, almond, and shea butters. This buttery feel translates to a product that glides effortlessly onto the skin.\n​However, this is where the experience can be a bit of a learning curve. Because of the high pigment and soft texture, a very light hand is essential. Many users have noted that tapping the brush once or twice into the pan is more than enough for both cheeks. Using a dense or angled brush seems to work best for picking up and blending the product without it becoming patchy. Some reviewers have even found that a damp beauty sponge gives a more airbrushed, dewy finish.\n​Pigmentation & Longevity\n​True to its claims, the Buttermelt Blush is exceptionally pigmented. The color payoff is instant and vibrant, so a little product goes a very long way. This is great for achieving a bold look, but it can be challenging for those who prefer a more subtle flush. This intense pigmentation also means a single pan of blush could last for a very long time.\n​As for longevity, the blush generally receives positive feedback. It is marketed as fade and transfer-resistant with up to 12 hours of wear, and many users agree that the color holds up well throughout the day. It maintains a healthy, fresh-looking glow for several hours without needing a touch-up.\n​Pros and Cons\n​Pros:\n​High Pigmentation: A little goes a long way, making the product a great value.\n​Unique Texture: The creamy, buttery formula blends smoothly and doesn't emphasize texture or pores.\n​Long-lasting: It has good staying power, often lasting for most of the day.\n​Affordable: It offers high-end quality at a drugstore price point.\n​Great Shade Range: Available in a variety of shades with both soft matte and glowy finishes to suit many skin tones.\n​Cons:\n​Fragile Formula: Due to its soft, \"buttery\" consistency, the blush is very delicate and prone to cracking or breaking, especially if dropped.\n​Learning Curve: The intense pigmentation can be difficult to work with initially, and it requires a light hand to avoid a \"clown-like\" look.\n​Strong Scent: Some users are sensitive to the strong, sweet, and candy-like scent of the product.\n​Expiration: Some reports indicate a relatively short expiration period of six months, which can be an issue given how little product is needed for each use.\n​Final Verdict\n​The NYX Cosmetics Buttermelt Blush is a high-impact, high-value product that offers a stunning, long-lasting flush. While its intense pigmentation and fragile formula may present a challenge, the beautiful finish and affordable price make it a worthwhile addition to any makeup collection. It's perfect for those who want a vibrant blush that lasts all day and are willing to take a little extra care with its application and handling.",

I was/am so excited to have been selected for this product to be sent to me. Unfortunately, I am met with disappointment as well due to Talc being in the ingredients. After learning how unhealthy it is I got rid of a ton of my cosmetics (I am a collector) because it is in so many,high end included! BUT I will say I'll be hanging on to this one for special occasions because it is just too pretty! It's a buttery smooth feel, almost like a cream but it's not. Super good pigmentation and also has a dewy sheen to it like a highlight. I rated it low because of the risk talc poses. If they can remove that I would buy every color and rate it much higher.",
