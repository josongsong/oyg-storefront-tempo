And not only did it work, it's basically saved my skin!\nMy mum has been in and out of hospital the last few weeks and I've been consistently masked up for that, even sleeping overnight in heavy duty N95 masks and have experienced zero breakouts, even in the places where the seams are pressing against my face! This has definitely helped my barrier be more resilient and is my go-to cleanser now.",

I also have KP, that mostly develops in my \"stache\" area, but can develop on the sides of my face and neck without regular care. \nFor my oily areas (primarily my nose) and eye/brow area, this worked wonderfully, but for everywhere else it worsened the dryness, and also increased acne. I had to use two different cleansers for it to be of any use, which somewhat defeats the purpose for me. My summertime and autumn experiences with it were more positive, but the acne problem still stuck around too. \nTo be clear, I don't feel it contributed to worsening acne, just that it doesnt work well enough to get rid of it or prevent it. \nEven during autoimmune flares ive had, and while using using trentinoin, it did not cause irritation. It was actually a bit soothing!! For this reason I give it three stars.",

It took me several uses to figure out I could take less again than the previous uses.\nI love how this feels on my skin.  This is so rich, creamy and luxurious feeling on my skin; purely soothing. The richness of this cleanser is evident while I am massaging into my skin as it feels just velvety.  This rinses off completely and makes my skin feel renewed is the closest I can come to describe it. It doesn't feel just clean and moisturized; it feels balanced!!  It's truly unlike and incomparable to any cleanser I've ever used.\nI have oily, somewhat problematic skin and this has been a dream for my skin. My skin has been almost totally free of any blemishes since I started using this. I used to wake up with shiny, oily skin every morning but no more!! This definitely has balanced out my skin in the most amazing way! I've found I need less moisturizer since using this too. THIS has become my FAVORITE CLEANSER!!\nI highly recommend this as more than just a cleanser, BUT, a protective, balancing cleanser! And, just and fyi, I rarely give a product 5 stars. These are well earned!!",

It would not get me excited to wash my face. There are some face cleansers that gives one feels of excitement, more wake, just happier feeling, Feel the cleanness. Not this cleanser. This product would not be for the ones who want that feeling during and after.  I used the product and can't really tell if it really did anything better than my other face cleanser. This product suppose to have MicroSliverBG, that is suppose to get rid of germs, viruses, and other toxins on the skin. Unsure if my skin is cleaner or if it had germs, viruses and other toxins. So that part is unknown. The product did clean my skin, my face didn't feel dirty. Did not feel like I needed to rewash my face.  I don't think I will be buying this product again. It wasn't for me.  Someone might like this product, others might not. I think its hard to get into the product. Its ok. its a product you don't fall in love with. its very replaceable and forgettable. Its kinda feels like a product one might use for a short time (like for medical) and then go back to your normal product.  Just doesn't feel like an everyday product. Something one uses for life. I am not into this product. Someone else might be. I think males might like this product more than females would. For me, when cleaning my skin, I want that feeling that makes me feel alive afterwards. I can start the day feeling, and then use at night to feel fresh and relaxed for bed. This product does not make me feel that way. Its a blah feeling. I just have clean skin but nothing makes me feel like it would boost my day and make me feel relaxed and fresh for bed. If you are looking for that feeling, then this product is not for you.",
