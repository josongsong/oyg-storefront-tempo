However, I only used for a quick wash and my face turned red, warm, and splotchy in several areas. I wonder if this is a reaction that would subside or worsen with continued use?",

I immediately ordered this size as I had previously used a sample. After using this plus the moisturizer that goes with it for a few days my oiliness was back to it's usual oiliness. After using it for 2-3 weeks, my skin was incredibly dried out. I also had 5 NEW MILIA SPOTS. So I do not recommend for oily or combination  skin. (I'm 37 years old if this helps)",

        "comments": "I have used the Nutritious cleanser for many years. It had become my favorite cleanser. In fact, I have gifted it to family (and vice versa), and I always keep a  few extra tubes on hand. While I understand that Estee Lauder is trying to connect to a new generation of users, by changing its packaging, it should have never changed the formula. The old formula, which contained pomegranate was absolutely heavenly and I would leave on as a mask on occasion. Conversely, this new formula is just terrible. In just a few uses, my skin feels like sandpaper and stripped. I am now stuck with three extra tubes, which is money poured down the drain. Not only would I not recommend to a friend, I would not recommend to an enemy.",

I had never tested out skincare products so was ready to see what they had to offer! \n\nI wasn't exactly sure what to expect when opening the box, but the sample size was quite small. However, I have gotten a weeks worth of product out by using a small amount and lathering it with my hands first before using it on my face which has worked quite well! The product has minimal smell, it just smells clean. \n\nI have combination skin and this cleanser has helped me look more glowy and healthy looking just over the span of a week! I had a few spots of acne here and there and it didn't seem to completely remove them but didn't make them worse either. \n\nI usually double cleanse to really get the oil and makeup off of my face after a long day, but wanted to give this product the full review and only used this. It seemed to work really well at removing all the \"grime\" from my face! It lathered really well and was easy to keep scrubbing to get more effect! It was more of a creamy cleanser in my opinion than foaming (similar in texture to the Tula one) but still worked well! \n\nI am a BIG fan of the packing! It was adorable and so bright for spring!! Loved the pink! Overall rate this product highly and would love the opportunity to continue testing with a larger sample! Thank you Influenster for this VoxBox opportunity!!!",

        "comments": "I love Estée Lauder products so I was excited when I learned I'd be receiving this in exchange for my review. The Nutritious 2-in-1 Foam Cleanser is infused with Sweet Kelp, Red Algae Ferment and coconut water ferment and claims to purify pores and leave you with glowy skin. It's a 2 in 1 product, as you can use this simply as a foaming cleanser or leave it on for a 1 minute mask. It is EWG certified although it is not entirely free of comedogenic ingredients. The packaging is bright and pretty and the grapefruit ombré color reminds me of the summer. I decided to try it out as both a cleanser and mask and I wasn't blown away. I have combination skin that can be sensitive and coming right out of the winter season my skin is on the drier side. This did not pair well with this cleanser. I had a difficult time getting it to foam but it definitely felt like a foaming cleanser —when I washed it off, my skin felt stripped and \"squeaky clean\". I didn't notice a glow to my skin nor did it give me what my skin is currently looking for in a cleanser: moisture and glow. At first my skin felt clean but no matter how much moisture I tried to aid my skin with, it was still extremely dry. On the plus side, it isn't scented or fragranced and it didn't break out my sensitive skin. As a mask, it seemed to give me the same results as a cleanser and dried out my skin. Since I'm on the combo side, maybe this product would be more effective to those with normal to oily skin that need to clean away that excess oil. \nKeep in mind, I received a small travel sample size so this review does not reflect my opinion of its affects on my skin over a long period of time. Overall, this didn't suit my skin needs as a combination skin type and I would not recommend to those with dry/combo skin to try this cleanser. It's \"foaming\", drying and I didn't see my skin glow. The market is oversaturated with glow products that are more affordable and give results but those with oily skin might benefit",
