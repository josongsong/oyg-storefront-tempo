It blends easily with clean hands and coverage is moderate - just enough to camouflage my dark spots, without being too thick.  It is buildable if you want more coverage.  I was worried that it would be to 'glowy' for my combination skin, especially in my oily t-zone, but it's not.  I would call the finish dewy without being too shiny or oily.  The only thing to watch out for is the color matching.  In the elf camo cc cream, I am a light neutral (which is what I usually am with most foundations in other brands), however, in halo glow skin tint mineral SPF 50, I was a light, warm.  Wasn't a big deal since I exchange it, but something to consider when selecting your shade.  I would recommend this product.",

        "comments": "Disclaimer: Long Review. I went into a lot of detail in the hopes of helping others considering buying this product. Please also remember that every single review posted is simply a matter of opinion and circumstance, and only you can decide what products suit your needs at the given price point :)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I am currently a senior in college. I spent 1.5 hours of labor at my meager wage to purchase this product, and in no way is this sponsored. I saw that people were skeptical about the incentivized reviews, as was I.\n\nBackstory: I enter my hometown Ulta while out on Summer break to use a coupon that was about to expire. As a broke college student, I headed straight for the \"non-prestige\" section. Enter this product. Initially, I was not expecting anything incredible. Though e.l.f. and I have a long track record, I never went out of my way to buy any of their foundations. My skin tone is apparently very hard to match, as most shades are either too warm or dark, and due to this I refuse to purchase any foundations online. Additionally, I have very oily skin, and it is VERY sensitive. I also hate the FEELING of makeup, and this is why I rarely wear any. I cannot stand the \"heavy, cemented\" feeling of most foundations, and avoid mascara and lashes all together.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about this product was the packaging. Pink-- which appeals to my \"girly\" aesthetic. (I will mention, though, that you cannot just sit the bottle down in the middle of use like you can with most others. I have no idea why they decided to make the opening face downwards...)\n\nI pick it up, thinking that the shade will be too yellow/warm like always. I put a little drop on the back of my hand and... the shade match is PERFECT. When I tell y'all this is the first time I have ever had a foundation do this... I teared up on the spot. I realize this is a rare occasion and might not happen for everyone, which is why I vouch for always trying on bases in store. The formula was very liquid-y, in the best way possible. It quite literally feels like a serum and is exactly what I was looking for. I researched the poor reviews and was concerned that what I was reading was not lining up with the product I had in hand. I decided to purchase it anyway, and I am so glad that I did.\n\nDo not get me wrong, this product is no Shape Tape. It's no Double Wear. It is a very lightweight, low-medium coverage serum like foundation that evens skin tone. As someone with very sensitive skin, I love how I can put this product on and have the look of makeup but the feeling of a bare face. It is INCREDIBLE. You do have to put a generoud amount on for heavier coverage, but it is so worth it imo. Before this product, I was using Morphe Skin Tint, which is similar but with a thicker consistency and subpar shade match (it tended to oxidize and turn too warm after application).\n\nIt blends nicely, is not cakey at all, and stays pretty well. I tested it several times in different conditions. It stayed on during my apartment move-in day in southern LA (110 heat index), a 20 minute shower, and an 8 hour shift at work. In my opinion, this is the best foundation I have tried, and I will be a repeat customer. \n\nWhile I am no make-up guru, I wanted to share a small list of the products I use for other girlies out there who like the look of make-up but not the feeling:\n\n- Tatcha The Silk Canvas Filter Primer (goes on sale 50% off around Black Friday/Prime Day)\n- This foundation\n- Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush (\"a dot is a lot\" rule from elementary school applies nicely here)\n- e.l.f. Halo Glow Contour Beauty Wand\n- NYX Professional Makeup Pro Fix Stick Color Correcting Concealer\n- Clinique Stay Matte Sheer Pressed Powder\n\nFor $18, I highly recommend this product. I am genuinely confused by the negative reviews, and encourage you to check this out in store if possible :)",

I have tried many elf products some of which I use very often (hydrogrip primer, and glowscreen dupe). I dont know if its just because I got to light of a shade or what but I did not like it! I have primarily dry skin and that probably was part of the problem and i did use skin prep but when I put it on it was very cakey and dry lokking.I would not recommend this product!!",

At the time I received the offer, I went with something more along the lines of my winter shade. As a neutral medium deep girl that prefers to match to her neck/chest, it's hard to find shades that hit both my undertone and shade. I didn't realize however this would have zinc oxide (known to leave a white cast on darker skin tones). I would recommend that a) you match to your face if you typically match your foundation to somewhere else and b) consider trying a shade darker than you think. Based on the swatches, I assumed I would be a 10N but it seems I should have gone with the tan cool/deep neutral. It's hard to tell in the pictures but I had a pretty bad white cast when I used the amount recommended for sunscreen application. I suspect that the white cast would still be the case even if I was using this at my palest in the middle of winter. The only other thing is that you should wait to apply this after your skincare. The product seemed to separate weird when I applied it almost immediately after my moisturizer. It also seemed to struggle under makeup unless I really waited a good bit. It's a big shame because this feels nice on the skin when worn alone! I enjoyed wearing it out when I wanted a little bit of coverage but didn't have time to do a heavier makeup look. The skin tint definitely gives skin when it's blended out. I will note that it lasts but not necessarily all day if you're an oily skin girl like me. I'd recommend this for a quick on the go look if you can find your right shade.",
