        "headline": "Caused Me Months of Breakouts + Irritation",
        "comments": "Let me preface this review by stating that I like Corsrx as a brand and have had success with many of their other products in the past. I first tried them out back in 2015 when they were only available for purchase through a few Korean skin care importers such as Soko Glam ect. and thus I felt some level of confidence when picking out this cleanser. \n\nI have dry/combination skin that tends to lean on the sensitive side, but nothing about this cleanser gave me any indication that it would irritate my skin. Within a week or so my skin started to feel dry and my overall skin texture started to worsen. I started to get small white heads all over my forehead and hairline, and eventually started to get cystic breakouts on my forehead as well. At the time I attributed this to stress and poor diet, but even after making significant changes in an attempt to improve my skin nothing was changing. I have always had relatively clear skin and when I do breakout it's almost always hormonal and pops up around my period. This was very different. The breakouts were near constant and my skin seemingly worsened no matter what I tried externally or internally. \n\nAbout a week ago I started to really reflect on my routine, products, and any lifestyle changes that could have been causing my breakouts. I was exhausted and frustrated and was even considering seeing a doctor to see if I was suffering from some kind of hormone imbalance. I had a gut feeling that this cleanser could be the root cause of my problems, and immediately threw it away and purchased the cleanser I was using prior to this one. In a matter of DAYS it became abundantly clear to me that my gut instinct was correct. My active breakouts started to clear up. The painful cystic spot on the middle of my forehead has shrunk by nearly 80%. The scarring from old breakouts over the months have started to fade. I have had no new white heads pop up. My skin feels HYDRATED again. This cleanser may work for some people, but after reading other reviews it seems to me that if you have dry, sensitive, or even combination skin you need to stay away from this. I have never had a product cause my skin to react this way and I only wish I would have realized it sooner.",

I use it night (i know its meant for morning) AFTER removing my makeup with micellar water, i wouldn't recommend just cleansing your face with this, make sure you get all the makeup off first. it leaves my skin feeling smooth, evens out the tone, and has seriously reduced acne so well. i highly recommend giving it a try if youve had persistent, full face acne.",

        "comments": "Skin 'profile':  aged, reaction prone/allergic, oily/dehydrated, with  2 medical skin conditions that this does not irritate.  IMO, it is suitable for all skin types.  Cosdna ingredients list is totally clean.  If you want in depth info on this product, intragoogle it on Snow White and the Asian Pear, which fully tests/compares/ evaluates AB/KB products.  Cleansers wash away, fact.  The bha in this is not sufficient to exfoliate...but it does restore the acid mantle, so that the rest of the routine is most effective.  Your exfoliation comes from the leave-on products, like Cosrx blackhead power liquid. (Available on Ulta.) This cleanses effectively without stripping, leaves no residue, and softens mildly.  Its core benefit is as a phenomenal prep for other products.  Cosrx tends to be consonant with 'Paula principles,' that is no irritating fragrance and no alcohol.  The 'Good morning' does not mean it is only an AM cleanser, but you will wish to use micellar or oil cleanse for the m/u at night.  Just received a 24 piece anniversary goody bag.  None of the cleansers (Bliss, Badescue, Dermalogica) remotely compare to the Cosrx.  Another key point is that the size lasts forever, so it is incredibly cost effective.  If you are adventurous or easily bored with skincare, and want to be on to the next best thing, this may be too much product for you. My first tube was from Memebox, which Ulta is now partially representing, and I had to get the second tube elsewhere online...but Ulta listens (I have touted this product in other user reviews) and now carries this first rate and cost effective product. Thrilled that Ulta is expanding Cosrx.  This will be a forever repurchase.",

        "comments": "I was really excited to try this cleanser after I researched the ingredients, and I gave it the stars I did because of all the good ingredients, but I've found myself very disappointed with the result. When I used this for the first week, i found my skin feeling uncomfortable (a little bit stripped in a way that felt sticky, but when i touched my skin it felt soft and clean) until I used my toner. The next week I started to feel my skin getting drier and drier in my t zone, mainly on my cheeks near my nose and in between my eye brows. Most recently, when I used the cleanser before a clay mask, I had a severe reaction and those areas completely dried out. That made me decide to stop using the cleanser. This cleanser also lathers very intensely and at times is even foaming, which I didn't expect. I think this contributes to the drying and it makes washing the cleanser off very difficult. With more moisturizing cleansers I'm able to use a good amount and be able to wash it off just fine, but with this even when I used less pea sized amount it took me a very long time to get rid of all of the bubbles.",
