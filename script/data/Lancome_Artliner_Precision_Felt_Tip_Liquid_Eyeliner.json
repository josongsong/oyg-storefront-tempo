I was a die hard Stila girl for a ling time, I branched out + tried a few other brands as well. \n\nI think what makes this so great is that the ink flows smoothly + evenly, creating a flawless line. I suspect they add more ink, and higher quality ink than other liners. Using traditional liquid eyeliners from other brands, I find its patchy with the liquid unevenly dispersing. So i have to go over it again in certain spots. \n\nKeep in mind I only use brown eyeliners. So I believe its easier to notice consistency vs inconsistency in browns which are not as opaque as black. \n\nI purchased the shade in metallic brown and honedtly, its perfect! It's a great everyday shade in a warm yummy brown, and you can only tell its metallic close up! \n\nI highly recommend this product and think all the brands should know this is the move!!!",

I was shocked when I opened it for the first time to apply it and there was hardly any product on a tiny, uneven looking brush. The first swipe of the eyeliner onto my eyelid didn't even make it halfway across before I needed to get more eyeliner on the brush, and the line that WAS produced was watery and uneven. I dipped the brush back into the eyeliner and had to screw it back on and shake it repeatedly to get a tiny modicum of color on the brush! I had to do that 5-6 times just to get both eyes lined and the end result was just depressing. I've never encountered  a liner that smudges this easily. I've been doing my eyeliner for 30 years, and I've never taken the time to write a negative review, so that should tell you something. \nBuyer beware.",

I shook the bottle like you're supposed to and when I was applying it.  Some of it comes out black and then it gets weird and watery.  Once the product dried, it started flashing off in patches.  \nI smelled it since it was acting off, and it smells like mildew and moldy. \nThis has to be a bad or expired product.  I want to return it but Ulta said I couldn't without its original packaging.  I threw it out because I have never had any issues with lancome before.  I really want to return this since it obviously has something wrong with it.  Even the girl at ulta agreed it smelled weird but she wouldn't help me.",

I have a little oily skin, so even when I put the eyelid primer, these eye liners got smudged. Also, these were not easy to apply. However, ARTLINER from LANCOME is an absolute winner!! I finally found the one that really works!! I've been using it for over a week now. * It stays on for the whole 9 hrs while I left home, went to work, and came home!! * It does not smudge. * Color stays the same as well -- it does not fade away. * It dries faster than I expected, so it's nice especially when I don't have much time in the morning before I go to work. * Also, it is easier to apply than I thought. A little tip for you -- When the color gets lighter, just put the pen back into the tube, shake a little (which makes some clicking sound), and the liquid is on again. I hesitated for a month or so to purchase this eye liner because this isn't cheap for me, but...I highly recommend this eye liner! Totally worth it :-) This was my 1st Lancome purchase.",
