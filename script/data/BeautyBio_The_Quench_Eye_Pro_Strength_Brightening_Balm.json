That's how fast and amazing this stuff works. Nothing will make your skins feel this soft and supple. And no breakouts! (a few moisturizers make me break out for some reason but not this) The only downside is the price; it's horrendously expensive so I hafta wait until my bday & xmas gift cards and rewards points to buy it so I only buy it about once a year. A little goes along way so I can make it last a few months. I'm 56 with normal to dry skin.",

After getting the product, I realized right away why and it's nothing to do with the cream itself and more with the horrible packaging. I wish this company would get rid of the ridiculous tube looking pot that is completely useless, wasteful and doesn't even do a good job of keeping the product in and instead, gave the customer more product. It's so beyond extra in a very bad way. I was so disappointed the cream itself it's only 1.7 oz! That's $73.50 per oz.

My skin is very sensitive and also am dealing with hormonal acne around my jawline, this moisturizer feels so buttery yet quenches my skin.  Best when used after i micro needle. I can definitely feel how supple and moisturized my skin looks and feels. I wish it was cheaper, because i honestly don't think i could afford purchasing it every month.. the only downside to this AMAZING moisturizer.",

After getting the product, I realized right away why and it's nothing to do with the cream itself and more with the horrible packaging. I wish this company would get rid of the ridiculous tube looking pot that is completely useless, wasteful and doesn't even do a good job of keeping the product in and instead, gave the customer more product. It's so beyond extra in a very bad way. I was so disappointed the cream itself it's only 1.7 oz! That's $73.50 per oz. If someone like me loves this cream but hates the pkg and price, please let us know if you have found a dupe for it.",
