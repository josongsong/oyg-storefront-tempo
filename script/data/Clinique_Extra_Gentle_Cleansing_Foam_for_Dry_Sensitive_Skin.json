I can't think of any face product I've EVER used that smells like it came from my husbands garage! I does a wonderful job of removing makeup but I wouldn't feel comfortable using it daily. I'm rather shocked that its labeled a gentle cleanser since it smells like it would take the paint off a car or furniture, lol!",

I specifically bought this product for the purpose of 1-2 days a week use for oily days and I have a non foaming cleanser for everyday use. (I have dry skin and mild eczema) if you have bad eczema and very sensitive skin this product may irritate your skin and dry it out.",

This cleanser does not leave my skin dry or tight, but does a great job of cleaning; when I follow it up with micellar water there is never any makeup or residue left. It does not lead to any stinging, even on the most irritated areas of skin. It's a good follow-up for oil cleansing as well, but it does such a good job cleansing on its own that I don't bother double cleansing on days I don't wear makeup. I would recommend this to anyone with dry or sensitive skin who wants to be sure their skin is clean but not stripped.",

Everything that I put on my face caused a new breakout or furthered the problem. The only thing I could tolerate was Vaseline. My hair stylist recommend this cleanser because she said so needed to clean any bacteria on my skin to resolve the problem. I tired this cleanser and it truly help saved my skin! Using it twice daily along with Vaseline at first and later Clinique moisture surge overnight mask, I was able to resolve my contact dermatitis and get my skin back to normal. I still use this cleanse daily to keep my skin clean it has kept any further contact dermatitis from developing and has never caused my dry sensitive skin any issues, thank you Clinique!",

I can't think of any face product I've EVER used that smells like it came from my husbands garage! I does a wonderful job of removing makeup but I wouldn't feel comfortable using it daily. I'm rather shocked that its labeled a gentle cleanser since it smells like it would take the paint off a car or furniture, lol!",
