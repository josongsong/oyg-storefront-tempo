        "comments": "Umm Cliniques been coming in hard lately with every launch. I'm a big fan of their skincare, and honestly their makeup is just as amazing. This concealer really really surprised me and I'm extremely impressed. It's sooo smooth and creamy, doesn't crease or settle into any fine lines, you also don't need to use a powder because it pretty much sets itself which is nice. I also use it to spot conceal my blemishes and even my dark spots from my \"Maskne\". I work 9-10 hour days with my mask on, so that's really been making me break out. I stopped wearing face makeup to work because first of all, there's no point nobody can see my skin underneath the mask. And second of all, makeup under my mask just creates a mess with transfer and oily ness from sweating. BUT this concealer changed that for me!!!! It's sweat and oil resistant, and it doesn't make me breakout and I'm extremely extremely acne prone! It literally covered all of my blemishes and dark scars, and it didn't budge the entire work day!!! No transferring and it stayed put. It's basically my dream concealer it does it all. Also it really does cancel out my dark circles, I usually have to use a color corrector prior to my concealers but with this one I don't need to use a corrector. One less step in my makeup routine. \n\nNote: I own every concealer you could think of. Armani, Charlotte Tilbury, Pat McGrath, tarte shape tape, both of Estée Lauder's, I also have all the other Clinique concealers, I have smashbox, urban decay, all of NARS concealers, Fenty, too faced, hourglass, and so much more (I think you get the point I'm making) I'm a makeup hoarder. So just to give you an idea of what kind of products I'm comparing this Clinique concealer too, I think that says a lot because I love a lot of my high end concealers that I own. But this one just takes the cake. I find myself reaching for this everyday lately. It's so lightweight too. Im so impressed and pleased. The price point is just right!!!",

The color (CN 90) was a bit warm for my complexion despite being a cool undertone. I'm bi-racial with medium skin & cool/neutral undertones. It applied nicely, but it oxidize to a more warm color quickly. I was able to use it in spots that I don't typically lighten and it does have very decent coverage (completely got rid of my dark chin scars). Sadly the orange undertone really limits where it can be put. I might try CN 74 at some point because the formula is light weight and coverage is still very full, but i wasn't so wow'd by it that I'll purchase it in a hurry. \nAlso the sponge at the top is kind of a waste because it doesn't come out, so there's no way to wash it.",
