It doesn't play will with other skin care products but that's because it takes time to sink in. I use this every night before bed and my skin feels pillow soft in the morning.

I'm not sure about these reviews that talk about it burning their skin…maybe they are allergic to lavender? For my super sensitive skin, this stuff has been great! I've not used it long enough to see any real results from it, but I will say that my skin does feel pretty amazing after a week of use.",

Locks in moisture overnight, my skin always felt hydrated in the morning. \n- Works well with other products. I have used with an eye cream and sometimes over a layer of hyaluronic acid serum for extra hydration and have never had any pilling or weird reactions. \n- Lavendar scent is light and pleasant. Strongest when first applying then fades away. \n\nCons:\n- Expensive! Lasts a long time but there are more economical options out there. \n- Irritates dry eyes. I noticed I would have some tearing and burning after removing my contact lenses and then applying this product on days my eyes were dry. I attribute this to the lavendar scent since similar frangrace free products did not have the same effects. Not a deal breaker but something to be aware of. \n- Didn't always want the lavender scent. It was nice, but personally I got tired of it and more often than not wished it was fragrance free.",

It improves fine lines, dry, dull skin, loss of firmness and tired looking skin. .\n\nIt's Proprietary Rest & Restore Technology works overnight when your skin cell turnover peaks. It's made with ceramides to help repair and restore the natural skin barrier and Infused with a soothing lavender scent.\n.\n\nThis is a thicker moisturizer and does leave a tacky feel to your skin. I use it before bed and when I wake up my skin feels soft, but greasy. My skin looks less dull and more vibrant. I really love the lavender scent it's perfect for bed time. .\n\n@itcosmetics @powerofreviews \n#skincare #skincareroutine #antiaging #skincream #gotitfree #wrinklesbegone #skincareaddict #skincareproducts #beauty #beautybloggers #beautyinfluencer",

Well, even after the first application I was very disappointed. While the lavender smell doesn't bother me, the consistency of the product, and how it applied were awful. Per someone else's experience/review from 6 months ago, I ran into the same issue of the product becoming rather waxy and rolled up into little sticky splodges when I was simply trying to massage the product into my face. Not only that, but those little gluey blobs ended up coming off onto my pillow case (pictured), the product just wouldn't absorb into my skin. \r\nThe consistency of the product was also odd, compared to the Confidence in a Cream moisturizer, which I thought was strange. Along with that, I felt that even after giving it a second try, it started to really irritate my skin, so I simply ended up throwing the product out. I'll be sticking with Confidence in Cream from here on out...",
