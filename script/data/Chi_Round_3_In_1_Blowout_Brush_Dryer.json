Piece that is supposed to hold attachments on will break cause its flimsy plastic. Pass on this product",

The dryer itself is good, light weight, temperatures not too hot and handles well.  But, it left my hair SO frizzy. My hair is somewhat wavy, not very thick and normally easy to dry.  But the bristles on the brush are both nylon and hard plastic.  I believe this is why it made my hair so frizzy.  The bristles pulled the hair more than a normal nylon bristle brush would have.  I tried it a couple of times just to make sure and results were the same both times. So I would have to give the dryer a thumbs down.  Sorry.",

        "comments": "Tbh, I just purchased this product and had low expectations. I don't particularly like Chi products. \nI have very curly/ corkscrew/ coily, somewhat fine hair but a lot of it and blowing drying it takes time and can be a hassle. That being said this blow drying brush was better than expected. Overall, my results were good and took about 30 mins in total to do my whole head which is an improvement from the 1 hr it takes with manual brush/ blowdryer duo. It left my hair very soft and initially was very smooth with minimal frizz and sleek at the root. \nI would recommend using while hair is about 60- 80% dry and working in smaller sections. The larger and less detangled my sections were as I got \"lazier\", the frizzier my ends would be. The attachments are easy to change and I like that the on- off -cool- low- high switch requires two hands as to not accidentally change the settings mid-use.\n\nI read reviews about the attachments not staying and that the product gets too hot or not hot enough.\n\n1. This is my first time using but the attachments stayed well even when I accidentally pressed the button so my advice would be make sure you're matching the arrows and securing them correctly.\n2. The attachments do get hot but not right away, as you start to use the brush more throughout the style they will heat up but nothing more surprising than using a hot tool on high so keep that in mind. I think the heat is nothing more than a normal blow dryer being used on high setting.\n\nI cant speak on the product malfunctioning after a few uses and not turning on but I have high hopes and will do research into warranty plans",

        "comments": "Chi loses 2 stars because of poor design which makes using this otherwise really nice tool a hassle. This tool works really well. Dries my hair super fast and leaves it bouncy and shiny. As other reviewers have stated, the handle is huge at the bottom and impossible to hold there. I can see why, I suppose the motor has to go somewhere. But that makes your hand naturally move up the handle closer to the brush. That's where the problem is. There are two quick release buttons so you can swap out the different brushes. I cannot tell you how many times I've accidentally pressed a button and popped the brush off mid-use. Very annoying. The top of the tool is also very small so it's tough to hold onto to stabilize the tool as you are turning it. Also, it requires two hands to turn on/off or change the speed. Chi people, come on. A one-handed mechanism is better for changing speed, which you may want to do periodically as you are using it. Conversely, NO ONE needs a one handed button to swap out the heads. We'd never do this mid-use. Overall I like this tool and the price was good, but I likely will replace it with something else when the time comes and not get another one of these. Gonna give a \"not recommend\" for this one because you should've done better, Chi.",
