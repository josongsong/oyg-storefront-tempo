This makes it perfect for minimalist and \"no-makeup\" makeup days.  It gives a beautiful, natural-looking finish that nevertheless provides a comfortable blendable surface for powder  face products (like blush, bronzer or highlighter).  The range of shades is somewhat limited in comparison to full-coverage foundations, but it melts so seamlessly into the skin that it adjusts to match the wearer's tone.  (I am very fair with very cool undertones, but Finland is plenty fair enough and its neutral undertones even out my own complexion and make it more friendly to all colors without looking unnatural.)\n\nAlthough the coverage is sheer, it does an excellent job evening out the complexion, minimizing the look of hyperpigmentation and blemishes.  I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for this tier of coverage and skincare, and I'm thrilled that Ulta is now carrying a limited collection of NARS staples.",

Annapurna was perfect for it and now they have replaced this with new tones. I've been purchasing this product for years. Since i could wear makeup. The new colours don't even compare to Annapurna. It makes me look washed out or it's too dark. There's nothing in between. For people with skin tones like mine why couldn't they leave the colours that works!!! It's so disappointing because i went to top up on my product but it was gone, we were not informed of this new range coming in. I have tried replacements but nothing compares to consistency and type of coverage. Bring back Annapurna!!",
