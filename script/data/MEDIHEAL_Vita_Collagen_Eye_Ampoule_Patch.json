        "comments": "I LOVE these things! They're a nice, large size so I can position them to cover both my undereye and my crows' feet. I choose to wear them overnight and when I wake up I don't have creases and wrinkles from side sleeping. I've noticed a reduction in the fine lines under my eyes. In regards to the reviewed who mentioned pilling, I personally haven't found a collagen product that doesn't do that (including famous brands) I would suggest using them at night and not before makeup. I hope that helps!",
