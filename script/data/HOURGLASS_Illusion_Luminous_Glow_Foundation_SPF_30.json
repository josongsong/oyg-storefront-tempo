Was able to find my shade. The Ulta I went to was in full stock. I used it today, and the foundation is the PERFECT match to my skin tone. The formula itself made me question if it will work but further blending with my sponge made it more easily blendable. I've now worn this for 9 hours and not one touch up, not patchy, not greasy. My skin took this product very well. This is my new favorite product!!! My skin is combo. Like, its not greasy but also not dry.",

This foundation is definitely medium coverage, but doesn't feel too cakey.  As many other users said, a little goes a long way, and it is easy to apply evenly.  My only \"complaint\" is that the finish is a bit more dewy/oily than I would prefer.  I don't love using a setting powder because I have dry/mature skin, but I find that I need to use some powder to cover the shiny appearance from this foundation.",

Spf is foundation is nice in theory but I'd rather apply sunscreen all over my face, ears and neck and then do my foundation. I had sworn off Hourglass because it's trash but their packaging sucked me in. As usual, their shades are horrendous. My closest match is 5 but it was still too dark and I'm not even fair. Their warm shades are always too yellow. The foundation is thick, doesn't apply well and there is no glow. In fact, it looked dry. I returned and bought myself a bottle of a Chanel foundation.",

A little goes a long way and it applies beautifully with a brush plus I love that it has spf. It has a nice thick yet creamy texture and doesnt cling to my drier patches. The real reason I fell in love is because my t zone wasnt super oily at the end of the day, something that happens with every other foundation I've used. It stayed beautiful and didn't crease. I also love that the coverage is buildable from a true medium coverage all the way to full coverage in the areas I need it. This is my new holy grail and I'll be recommending it to all my friends.

I will say because of the spf you probably don't want to be putting it too close to your eyes if they are sensitive like mine but that's literally the only thing I could even \"criticize\" about this foundation which really isn't even a criticisms but more so something to consider. What's interesting is I often struggle with finding foundations that are actually light enough to match my neck but this foundation was actually my perfect match! Although this foundation is more full coverage than I was expecting I meant that for an spf it's SUPRISINGLY full coverage but also it still will allow some of my freckles to show which I like and the thing is that if I want more coverage one day I can always just build this foundation up anyways so it's very versatile. I love how it neutralizes my redness but also still shows my freckles because my aim isn't to cover those but just the redness and usually when you cover one you have to cover the other. This is by far my favorite foundation out of my collection! I highly recommend it especially to my super pale girls! Another thing to note is this does have a scent that just smells like spf so if that bothers you just know that! Gifted by hourglasscosmetics",

        "comments": "⭐️I received this Illusion Luminous Glow Foundation with SPF 30 Complimentary from HourGlass Cosmetics in exchange for my honest review. \n\nI unfortunately was not a big fan of this product. First the shade I chose that would normally be a perfect match was too orange. I do like makeup that adds skincare benefits in it, but it didn't feel very hydrating on my face. It felt very thick and was actually hard to blend in. I had to use a damp beauty blender just to get it to fully blend. It left it kind of patchy, and not smooth. Has the day went on, I noticed creasing, even with using a primer and setting spray. This could also be due to the fact that my combo skin has been leaning very dry lately due to the cold weather. It does have a sunscreen smell to it, but that didn't bother me. I did like that it has SPF in it, so it took out the extra step of having to apply it before my makeup application. It is described as a foundation that reduces fine lines & wrinkles. I personally wouldn't consider this a foundation as it didn't cover up any imperfections. I'd consider this more of a skin tint. I was a huge fan of the previous HourGlass skin tint that is discontinued. I thought this would be comparable, but it wasn't as good, and wish they brought that back. I will say it is in very nice packaging, that makes it easy to apply. And the gold color is very pretty. This may work for you if you have oily/combo skin. I'm going to try again when it's warmer outside & my skin isn't as dry.",
