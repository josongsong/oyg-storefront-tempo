Last time I ordered, I received one bottle of the Hard Hold and one bottle of the Flash Freeze because they were reformulating it and the sku had not changed. \n\nThis week I had multiple bad wash days in a row, with really stringy and frizzy hair. The only thing that changed in my routine was that my Hard Hold bottle ran out and I started on the Flash Freeze bottle.\n\nI'm disappointed that I need to find something new. I recommended the previous formulation to all my curly friends!",

I have been committed to a certain brand for a long time and their mousse for curly hair. I was excited to try this and a little nervous because I prefer the mousse texture over a gel texture. I LOVED this product!!! I have been using it in conjunction with their hair oil as well for extra moisture. The one standout quality of this product is that it dries quickly and holds the curls as they dry. My mousse takes forever to dry and sometimes by then I've gotten hot and my hair gets frizzy and it dries funny. This product makes my hair perfectly curled with just a scrunch with your hands. The one thing to be aware of is, it is super hard hold so you only need a SMALL amount like dime size or smaller, and be sure to really spread it out, and do not get it heavily concentrated in any one area because it will be crunchy and stay looking wet! Overall, LOVE this product and will be sharing this info with my curly haired friends!!!",

I  have been using the mousse for a  couple of years with outstanding results for my wash and gos. I  decided to add the two not your moms' products to change it up. Usually, my hair curls up into beautiful ringlets but this time my hair turned into a  dry tight afro.   My hair went from 2C to beyond 4C. My hair was so dry and tangled that I  had to completely rewash my hair to detangle and get it remoisturize . I  could not even get a  comb through it. I  have never had this bad of an experience with any other brand  so I  will never use this brand ever again. I  had high hopes for this product line because it is cheaper than a  lot of the other brands, but  I  guess you get what you pay for. I  am so very grateful that I  saved my receipt.",
