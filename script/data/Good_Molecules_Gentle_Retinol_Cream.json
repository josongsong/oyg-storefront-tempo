        "comments": "I used this retinol cream for nearly a year (and swore by it) and it worked well for my skin—until recently, when i could swear GM quietly changed the formula and packaging. Not only does the new version smell HORRIBLE, but it caused me to have a severe breakout and what I believe was an allergic reaction. My skin has never reacted this badly to a skincare product before and I know for a fact it is directly linked to using this cream.\n\nIt's really disappointing that such a reliable product was altered without any clear notice. The new tube looks different, the texture feels off, (and you can definitely tell by the smell) and unfortunately, the results are the complete opposite of what I experienced before. I won't be repurchasing, and I'd caution others who had success with the old formula to be very careful with this new one!!",

I use azaleic acid in the morning, and this at night, and it keeps my skin acne free! I have had many two pimples in the last 6 months. Genuinely can't recommend this product enough!",

Each time I tried my skin would break out into an irritated rash and become super damaged in just one or two uses. I saw this one claimed to be gentle and it was super affordable so I gave it a try and its worked great! I had to incorporate it very slowly over a few weeks into my skincare routine but now I can apply it almost nightly with no problems. And my skin definitely looks brighter and I've noticed some of my fine lines and scars have faded a bit after using it now for about 6 months. At such an affordable price point, this product is definitely worth a shot for people trying to use retinol for the first time or people with ultra sensitive skin like me.",

This would be an amazing beginner retinol, especially for the price, and IT WORKS. When it says it's gentle, it's not lying. It doesn't burn, break me out, irritate, strip, or dry out my skin. I tried a stronger retinol serum/emulsion, and it completely broke me out in one use and nearly ruined my hard work I've put into my skin over the last couple years. Learned my lesson and immediately went back to this, and I don't plan on straying ever again! Loooove it and Good Molecules!",

        "comments": "I want to start this by saying everyone has different skin so what works for me might not necessarily work for someons else. I'm 25 going on 26 come November, and I have very dry, sensitive skin. I recently stopped taking birth control and had a cystic acne breakout the likes of which I havent seen since I was 15. I had huge, deep, painful cystic zits all over my chin, forehead, and cheeks. I kept with my regular skin routine and powerful zit cream for weeks to know avail. I made an appointment with a dermatologist but they couldn't see me for another 2 weeks. At this point I was using so many salicylic acid products that my face was dry and flaky and burned at the touch of even my sensitive skin moisturizer, without the zits so much as shrinking even a little. In a last ditch effort I read up on skincare a bit and decided to try retinol. I read that it can help with acne by purging skin of gunk, meaning it forces you to break out. I figured it cant be any worse than what I got now so I purchased this retinol cream and used it in combination with my regular face wash and toner, the Good Molecules Niacinamide serum, Super Peptide serum, Squalane oil (I read that these go well with retinol), and my regular  moisturizer. The retinol has thin creamg texture making it easy to spread around the skin. I honestly braced myself on first application, expecting it to burn, but I was pleasantly surprised when I didnt feel anything. I noticed a difference in my acne immediately the next morning. The deep cyst like blemishes all had white heads. It has now been a only week of using this routine and my skin is almost totally clear save for the few bigger blemishes on my chin that have now significantly shrunk in size. I am in awe that it worked so well. My dermatologist appointment is now in a few days and i dont even know what Im going to say since the deep what im assuming was hormonal acne, is almost completely gone. My skin feels amazing and has even stopped flaking and burning. I definitely recommend this product, but keep in mind I used it in combination with other products and retinol is more than likely going to cause you to breakout when you first use it because it's bringing gunk to the surface. I used to be a big The Ordinary fan but after this week I think Good Molecules might be my go to from now on!",

        "comments": "I have fallen in love with Good Molecules skincare products since receiving some of their products as a birthday gift. So when I went to place my first ever order I decided to go ahead and give the \"Gentle\" retinol a try as I've tried a vegan retinol from a different brand that I loved but it's just so expensive and Good Molecules is amazing and affordable skincare.   So I've been using this \"Gentle\" retinol for the past 3 days and certain areas of my face itch and then my neck is so red and extremely itchy and I've also had a really bad acne breakout on my jawline, cheeks, and forehead.   My nighttime routine consists of a nourishing cleansing balm, a nourishing/plumping mushroom toner, a skin essence, hyaluronic acid serum, then the \"Gentle\" retinol, a rich moisturizing cream, the good molecules Bakuchiol oil, and then a moisturizing face mist.   I always use sunscreen in the daytime. I tried to use a very very small amount of the \"Gentle\" retinol on the 3rd day but that did not help at all.   I'm discontinuing using this in my nighttime routine but I'm so so disappointed because it's so affordable and has amazing ingredients.  It just sucks to pay for something even if it didn't cost much and it cause this bad reaction and it's suppose to be \"Gentle.\"",
