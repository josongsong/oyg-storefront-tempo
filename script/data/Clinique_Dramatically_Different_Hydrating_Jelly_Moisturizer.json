I do not have to rush to work in the mornings anymore, so I take this out of the fridge where I store it and pat the jelly under and around my eyes and face and even apply it to my forearms. Then I sit in front of my fan and enjoy perfect cooling and moisturization. As an older woman, this gel formula may not be designed for me in particular, but I find it to be a joy in the morning.",

It even minimized the look of any texture on my hand. So I bought it and tried it for several days before returning it. When I put it on my face, it never seemed to actually absorb. It dried on top of my skin causing almost a cast-like feeling. If I used it under a liquid foundation, it caused crazy amount of pilling. When I used it under powered foundation (Bare Minerals), it gave me some very unsightly texture that I don't usually have. When I returned it, the woman working at the desk said a lot of other people had returned it for the same issues. I ended up going back to my tried and true Moisture Surge",

It feels a bit like I splashed some water on my face right after application!\n\nI'm a huge fan of the Moisture Surge Supercharged Concentrate and I was wondering what the difference would be. Obviously the ingredients are different, but I just put them both on my skin (DD on left, MS on right) and I'd say the MS feels slightly more \"potent\" and a little tacky. I definitely like it better than the yellow DDML gel formula, which was just not hydrating enough for me.\n\nThis is a \"win\" and I hope it stays around! Especially because it's clear and fragrance free... hopefully great for people who are super sensitive.",

I have used moisture surge mask, moisture surge \"super charged concentrate\", dramatically different lotion and gel. Purchased the dramatically different clear \"jelly\" and was not impressed at all. Honestly, I think you could get the same results from a $5 tube of KY Jelly.\n\nI was not paid, or given free samples to try this product. An honest review from a long time user of Clinique products. Save your money ladies and use one of their other products.",
