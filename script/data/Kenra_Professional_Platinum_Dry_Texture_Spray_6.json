I sometimes touch up the bedhead back…ya know…because it got slept on…but the front and mid look amazing. I always come back to this product. My stylist's product doesn't even hold my hair 4 hours. Because my hair just wants to be straw straight…until it met this Kenra product. Oh, I live in low humidity, but when I travel to high humidity regions, it still does the job.",

        "comments": "I found this while shopping for Kenra volume hairspray at my local Ulta store. I've been looking for a product that controls oil at the roots and still give volume. My hair is platinum blonde and many products make my hair look greasy or dull. This product doesn't do that! I can go 2 days without having to wash my hair if I use a little of this product every day. I'm not a morning person but my job requires me to be at work at 7am and this saves at least an hour of styling time on my hair every morning! I put my hair in a shower cap, take my shower, brush out my hair after, style it, and spray this and the volume spray on and it looks great. I always get compliments on my hair. This smells good too! I'll keep using this.",

        "comments": "I have fairly thick, straight hair so I mainly use volumizing products for my everyday hair style. I bought this to use with the Kenra Root Lifting Spray 13 and well as Paul Mitchell volumizing mousse. Perhaps its overkill? Because by noon everyday my hair feels and looks nice but is so flat. When I use this spray in the morning, I feel like I'm straight out of 1984 with the volume it gives me. I love it! But a couple hours into work, it looks like I have no product in. If I reapply during the day (I also got a free, travel size sample of this product), it does perk up.",
