        "comments": "One day I made the brave decision to actually invest my money in good skincare products. After spending days upon days of researching great skin care products that are affordable, Dermalogica came to my rescue. I was done and tired of emptying out my wallet so many times for continuous drugstore products that never work.I have severely dry skin, also which is oily at times, and is prone to breakouts as well. I first bought the beginners kit for dry skin, which worked very well for my skin. I did notice a difference in the look, texture, and clearity in my skin after a couple of weeks. What I mostly needed out of this kit was the moisturizer, as said before I have very dry skin so it is completely vital I use it morning and night. I've tried many moisturizers before this product, and yes they did moisturize my face, but that's it. They weren't long-lasting at all. The Intensive Moisture Balance is such a great product. It's more than a moisturizer to me. To put into words it's like my \"bodyguard\" for my skin. Whenever my skin is dry or very oily, I cleanse my face and put some of this moisture on, it does wonders. My skin never feels like a desert and most importantly is not oily or greasy. I can wear it under my makeup, mix it in with my foundation (as a tinted moisturizer) and I no longer have worries. Another great thing also is that a little, tiny amount goes a long way and it will last all day and not wear off. I totally recommend this product to anyone looking for a great moisturizer. I know everyone's skin is different, but it's worth a shot. Thanks Dermalogica!",

Still a good lotion but if I wanted a lighter lotion I would order one...now there doesn't seem to be a truly \"intensive moisturizing\" one on the dermalogica line...hope they will change back to their old formula!",
