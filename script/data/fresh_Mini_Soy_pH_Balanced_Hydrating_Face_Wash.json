It doesn't remove spf effectively, and you still end up with a significant amount of makeup on your face. They also changed the smell from that lovely, distinct Fresh smell to something almost…plastic like. It doesn't even work as a stand alone face wash. I've used it by itself in the morning, and when I take a cotton pad with miceller water to my skin, i still have residue on the pad. It certainly isn't worth the money, and Fresh destroyed a wonderful product.",

This cleanser specifically had been opened (the sticker they use to seal it was ripped). I sent customer service an email, they sent back emails through multiple threads instead of one asking all different things (what's your address, send us more pictures, etc,..). One email apologized and said they would send me a replacement if I respond with my address. When I did, they didn't respond for 5 days. When I FINALLY was able to reach customer service by calling them, I was told that I would need to return everything in order to receive either a refund or an exchange. At first, I was extremely upset about the condition the package arrived in, but I had hoped customer service would resolve the issue. When they initially promised a replacement and then backtracked on that offer, it only made the situation worse.",
