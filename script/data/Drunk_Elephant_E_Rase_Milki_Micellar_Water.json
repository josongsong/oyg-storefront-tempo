This is seriously the perfect way to freshen up my skin throughout the day, especially when I'm going makeup-free. It's super easy to use - just a quick shake and then smooth it over my face with a cotton pad. Plus, the milky texture feels so nourishing on my skin, and gives me an extra boost of hydration. I'm totally obsessed with how soft and cool my skin feels after using it. I received this product complimentary from Drunk Elephant in exchange for my honest review.",

It doesn't leave my skin feeling stripped, but I do have to say that it didn't feel like I was getting as deep of a clean as when I use my usual micellar water (I use both with the same cotton pads). It didn't irritate my eyes or make my contacts blurry, but I felt like I either needed to use more product or spend extra time to totally remove my relatively light eye makeup. Maybe it's just a learning curve as to how much to use or it would work better with a denser, less fluffy cotton pad. Gifted by Drunk Elephant",

The scent reminds me of rice ferment, which I actually don't dislike. This product is definitely not bad.\nI cannot justify the price though. I use it after working out before I shower, so I cannot speak to its makeup removal properties bc all it removes is my sunscreen and sweat before I shower. It's definitely meant to be a leave-on treatment bc the runoff stings my eyes in the shower if I don't cleanse right away. i cannot recommend bc I could arguably get the same results from a lower priced micellar water (and have, from Vichy's micellar for sensitive skin). As someone that is willing to invest into higher end products (I am a big fan of Dr Jart, Fresh, Dear Klairs, Josie Maran, Typology, and Sunday Riley leave-on products and use Dermalogica pre-cleanse and daily microfoliant) but especially since I wash this off almost immediately after use when it is meant to be left on it's just not a good fit for me.\na\nArguably, I could save money by using my Dermalogica cleansing oil in the morning, too, but I prefer the no-fuss of using micellar in the morning, especially since I'm only removing residue from my night routine, sunscreen, and sweat.",

I tried this out as my first step in my nightly regimen and found myself going through so much cotton to get my makeup off compared to other brands (La Roche Posay and IT Cosmetics). The texture was goopy and extremely heavy even for a dry skin person like myself. It left an uncomfortable texture behind so I wouldn't recommend this for people who want a no-rinse cleanser either. Also was not a fan of the scent. Smells like stale Play-Doh.",
