I needed something for moisture and fine lines. This 100% worked for me! There was a huge difference after a short time and I will definitely buy another tube. If you're using this for dark circles, this won't help because you need a cream with different ingredients that are made for that problem.",

My lips don't have wrinkles nor fine lines.\n\nI am finishing up my 2nd tube & will be purchasing a 3rd.  It has been already over 1 year of nightly use, so a little goes a long way.\n\nI never had dark circles & really don't have issues with puffiness.
