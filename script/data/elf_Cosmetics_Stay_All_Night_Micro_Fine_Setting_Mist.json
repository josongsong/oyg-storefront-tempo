        "comments": "I got this based on all the praise for its staying power and I'm genuinely confused. Are the good reviews for an older formulation?\n\nI have combo skin and haven't struggled with oil taking off my makeup in YEARS. This is alright for blending, hence the stars (though I think the alcohol separates concealer/foundation/etc., but that's nothing that can't be fixed with blending and powder). However, it doesn't do anything anything special for the way your makeup looks when you spray at the end (which is fine, cause it doesn't claim to). But after a few hours, my dry spots get dryer; and my makeup gets so oily that it literally transfers to ANY touch, even accidental brushes with my fingers (AND on areas where I don't usually get oily, like my cheeks). I tried using it several times, with different techniques to make sure I was giving it a chance, but I don't like it. \n\nTwo more cons, which aren't big deals to me: 1) the spray is super fine, maybe too fine, and 2) strong scents don't bother me but the alcohol is def present (high alc content may be what made my makeup disappear/thin out/separate when I was blending??).\n\nOverall, there's def better drugstore setting sprays out there, like Milani Make It Last or LA Girl Pro Perfect.",

The negative reviews about the packaging are bringing this product down when on the bottle it CLEARLY says due to the nature of the product and the ingredients, clogging will occur. Run it over hot water to clear the sprayer and remove residue and it'll be back to normal. I swear the population gets simpler and simpler as the years go on...anywho, for me this product is GREAT!! I have oily skin and I'm always looking for products to not necessarily keep me from being oily (sometimes that's inevitable) but to keep my makeup looking just applied, fresh and have it be longwearing (after blotting the oil away) This product does just that. I like to spray it in between my makeup steps for longevity and to keep my makeup from transferring so much in my mask. It does all that for me and keeps me looking great until I decide to take my makeup off. Nice cheaper alternative for the all nighter spray which I have used for years",

        "comments": "I got this based on all the praise for its staying power and I'm genuinely confused. Are the good reviews for an older formulation?\n\nI have combo skin and haven't struggled with oil taking off my makeup in YEARS. This is alright for blending, hence the stars (though I think the alcohol separates concealer/foundation/etc., but that's nothing that can't be fixed with blending and powder). However, it doesn't do anything anything special for the way your makeup looks when you spray at the end (which is fine, cause it doesn't claim to). But after a few hours, my dry spots get dryer; and my makeup gets so oily that it literally transfers to ANY touch, even accidental brushes with my fingers (AND on areas where I don't usually get oily, like my cheeks). I tried using it several times, with different techniques to make sure I was giving it a chance, but I don't like it. \n\nTwo more cons, which aren't big deals to me: 1) the spray is super fine, maybe too fine, and 2) strong scents don't bother me but the alcohol is def present (high alc content may be what made my makeup disappear/thin out/separate when I was blending??).\n\nOverall, there's def better drugstore setting sprays out there, like Milani Make It Last or LA Girl Pro Perfect.",
