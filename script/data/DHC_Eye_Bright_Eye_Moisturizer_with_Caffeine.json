After a few uses, I started to notice some slight irritation. A day after noticing this, my eyelids are on fire. Typically I wouldn't put the product on my eyelid but \"all around eyes\", in my opinion, means to the browbone. My eyes are irritated and burning, and there are small bumps around the eyelid. This might just be my skin reacting negatively, but I wouldn't take the chance if you hace sensitive skin.",
