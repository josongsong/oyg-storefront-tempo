        "headline": "Made me look sweaty, not glowy",
        "comments": "So this product is great, however it wasn't quite the result I wanted. I did find it worked to a certain extent and it does most of the things it claims to do, but since its not a translucent powder, i found that if i didn't meticulously blend out every crevice of my face, it would look cakey. Like you can't just use a brush like you would with any other powder and be done. It left the colored patches on my skin. And i felt like it didn't last. I would do my makeup and it would look good, then no more than 10 minutes later my skin was greasy, not glowy. I'm aware its supposed to leave a glow, but for people who have more oily or combination skin (i have combination) it doesn't work great. I would come home and look in the mirror for the first time in hours and something like my nose would be so oily that if you touched it with your finger it would leave the oiliness on your finger. That would happen even if i baked my face with it. Its just not for me but if you have dry skin it would probably work great, but it ended up just making my face look sweaty 90% of the time. But i will say it never felt heavy on my face and initially when i would put it on it made my makeup perfect. Its just not a long term product, you would have to reaplly a lot (at least i would have to). Hope this helps! (Im a teen by the way, so this is a teens perspective i dont know if that helps your opinion in any way, but i just thought id mention it)",

I actually ended up accidentally placing 2 of the halo glow powders in my cart (one pink and the other in light) and will be returning both promptly. The Halo Glow loose powder is super shimmery (almost frosted) and it exaggerated the heck out of any texture on my skin. It also has an almost clumpy/cakey looking texture and left a gummy (???) residue on my skin that felt tacky and seemed to leave me looking at least 14 yrs older. I tried both the pink and light colors with multiple combinations of sunscreens/moisturizers/primers with the same unpleasant results. I cannot get it to work for me. Maybe it's just my 42 year old skin that's the problem, but I will be exchanging both of these for the HD powder immediately!",

This product is so so so dry and cakey no matter what you do! I always prime and moisturize my eyes before adding makeup and this has kept my undereyes looking smooth. It doesn't matter with this powder. In my T-zone it doesnt asorb oil at all, it looks greasy and separates in a way that makes it look like small globs. Under the eyes it clings to every small crevice and looks so dry even straight after application. In short it looks terrible on application and even worse throughout the day! I've tried using a puff, sponge and brush and it doesn't matter. Waste of money.",
