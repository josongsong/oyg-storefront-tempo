        "comments": "Gifted by Moroccanoil in exchange for my honest review. The Moroccanoil Dry Texture Spray is such a versatile styling product that instantly elevates my hair routine. From the first spritz, it adds effortless volume and a perfectly tousled texture without making my hair feel stiff or sticky. I love how it gives that \"undone but polished\" look — like natural body with a touch of glamour. What really stands out is how lightweight it feels. Unlike some texture sprays that can leave a heavy or gritty residue, this one keeps my hair soft and touchable while still holding the style. It also helps refresh my hair on days I skip washing, giving it more life and movement. And of course, it carries the signature Moroccanoil scent — fresh, slightly sweet, and luxurious — which makes using it an enjoyable part of my styling routine. The 60ml size is perfect for on-the-go touch-ups or travel, yet still lasts a long time since a little goes a long way. Overall, this spray delivers the perfect balance of texture, volume, and flexibility. It's ideal for creating everyday waves, adding body before an updo, or just giving hair that effortless boost of style.",
