From the moment I placed them under my eyes they started to slide down. Every ten to twenty seconds I had to slide them back up. Blinking made them slide down even faster. After a few minutes of this I finally gave up and just held them in place. In my opinion these are definitely not worth the frustration.",

These eye gels are a lifesaver, especially on those mornings when I need a quick pick-me-up. The cooling sensation is incredibly refreshing, and they instantly make my under-eye area feel more awake and hydrated.\n\nWhat I love most is how they visibly reduce puffiness and soften the appearance of dark circles after just one use. The hydrogel material adheres perfectly to my skin without slipping, so I can pop them on while I'm getting ready or just relaxing. Plus, they're infused with a blend of nourishing ingredients that leave my under-eyes feeling smooth and plump.",

        "comments": "I was gifted these Floating Under the Eyes Depuffing Gel pads as part of the #florencepanel by Florence By Mills in exchange for my honest review. I love me a good under eye mask / pad and these were no exception! Packaged adorably and the gel pads themselves are cuter than cute which is something I noticed immediately and was tickled with how cute they were. They feel incredibly soothing and cooling when applied to the skin and had a lot of product which did make them slide a little a first. It was an easy fix though as I just scooped off the excess product and rubbed it into my skin and put the pads back in place under my eyes and they worked fine for the rest of the time I wore them. Designed to soothe, hydrate and depuff using caffeine, green tea and cactus extract, these pads definitely helped improve the appearance of my under eyes. It helped smoothed and hydrate the skin, noticeably decreased puffiness and just made me look more awake and renewed! I am excited to try some other products from the range and appreciate that these are also silicone, sulfate and paraben free.",

        "comments": "I'm very happy I got these as a sample and didn't pay for them. They wouldn't stay in place no matter how many times I put them back. From the moment I placed them under my eyes they started to slide down. Every ten to twenty seconds I had to slide them back up. Blinking made them slide down even faster. After a few minutes of this I finally gave up and just held them in place. In my opinion these are definitely not worth the frustration.",
