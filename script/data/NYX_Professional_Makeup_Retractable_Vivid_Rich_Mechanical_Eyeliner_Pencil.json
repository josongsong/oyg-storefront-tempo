        "comments": "Bought 3 during a buy 2 get 1 free promo. I purchased the shades Always Onyx, Truffle Diamond, and Quartz Queen. Quartz Queen is the perfect shade for tightlining along the bottom waterline to open up the eye. Because it's a pretty light nude, it's more subtle for us pale girlies, but would obviously be a more dramatic highlighting shade for dark skin, so keep that in mind. All three shades are very creamy and pigmented, and they glide on softly and smoothly. Because they are so soft, be extra careful during application, as the pencil can slip around a bit.\n\nThe liner stays in place very well, but it also dries very fast, meaning that it is harder to smudge (although it can be done if you're smudging WITH an eyeshadow). Because of this, mistakes are harder to fix.\n\nI haven't tested its longevity much, so I can't testify to that. Overall, it's a nice, creamy liner, but I wouldn't recommend it as a base color if you're looking to smudge it out for a smokier look.",

But this one day i guess i didnt clip the top fully and i lost the tube of liner in it. Lol. But im gonna repurchase this for sure",

        "comments": "Calling all blue lovers! The Vivid Rich Mechanical Pencil in Blue is the perfect pencil for you. It's bold, pigmented, and long-wearing, and it stays put all day long.\n\nI have oily skin, so I know what it's like to have makeup fade away after a few hours. But the Vivid Rich Mechanical Pencil is different. It's waterproof and smudge-proof, so it stays looking fresh and fierce all day long.\n\nI love using this pencil to line my eyes and waterline. The color is a dark but vibrant blue that makes my eyes pop. I've also been using it to create bold, graphic eyeliner looks, and it's perfect for that too.\n\nIf you're looking for a blue pencil that is truly bluetiful, then the Vivid Rich Mechanical Pencil in Blue is the one for you. It's a must-have for a great price! I'm already looking to purchase a few other colors, I'm very happy with this eyeliner! \n\nThanks to Influenster and NYX for allowing me to test this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. New fan!",

        "comments": "I had high hopes for this product based on the name of the line and the swatches￼, alas the shade I got, Deep Blue, looks neither rich, nor vivid on me. The application is super smooth without tugging, however, I am getting very sheer color in one pass, so I have to do two or three passes just to get the look I want and at that point, quite frankly, you would have to look very closely to tell it's the dark blue and not a grayish black. For some reason the pretty sparkle, you see when looking at the product itself does not come through for me when I have this eyeliner on - it just looks dull and not particularly exciting. Perhaps some other shades from this line produce better results, but I am definitely finding of this shade to be rather underwhelming. ￼ I do like the twist-up pencil format of this product,and it has decent staying power, but that's about it on the positives of this shade.",
