Personally, the way I help with the pilling is to apply the moisturizer on a damp face, not a dry one. I also like to mix the product on my hands really nicely and apply it, not just put some on my hand and apply. I like to mix it up really good, and I have noticed it helps a lot to almost completely rid of the problem.",

I was happy with how this moisturizer made my skin look (matte but not dull) and that it worked well on both the dry and oily parts of my face.\nThe unfortunate thing is that it pills a LOT, to the point that it bothers me enough that I don't want to wear it. I usually go barefaced and it still pills very badly. Putting sunscreen on top of it doesn't go very well and I imagine it would be worse with makeup. I'm really sad that it does this because I loved the product otherwise but now I have a nearly full tube of it that I can't wear which is a huge waste of money :(",

I thought will have since it's for oily skin.\r\nBesides that, the formula feels nice on my skin, I have no bad reactions to it. I do see some oils coming through on my T-zone, but not criminal. \r\nI'll use it every day and update my review if results change with every day use. \r\n\r\nPS: when I received the shipment, the box where moisturizer goes was broken (like in the picture) but the item was not damaged. Just want to mention so the company is more careful when shipping, to avoid any losses or angry customers.",

I then noticed that I suppose I'm not the only customer who this has happened to :(",
