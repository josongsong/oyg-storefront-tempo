I've tried $40 mascaras that are positively horrendous, and $10 mascaras that are completely amazing!  The first time I tried BeneFit's BadGal Bang! I got it as a sample in my BirchBox.  It sounded like so much fun I just had to try it.  I am in my early 50's now, but I actually look 29.  I'm genetically blessed.  I still have a full set of lashes on each eye, and they are naturally long and curly, so eyelash curlers are foreign to me.  The only drawback?  My eyelashes are blonde tipped, so they look shorter than they really are.  BadGal Bang! not only makes my lashes look their natural long length, they make me look like I'm wearing falsies, hee hee!  I've actually had a number of Ulta assistants come up to me while I've been browsing and ask me which brand of falsies I was using.  Imagine their astonishment when I informed them they were my natural lashes!  Ooo, were there some green eyed monsters!  BadGalBang is evrything as advertised, and then some!  Must have more!",

I will use a mascara for a little bit but always will want to try something when it comes out and it's new. I bought the small mini size of this because the store raved about it as well as some reviews I read online the brush looked like it would be something I liked. Mind you I have very long eyelashes however I need them to separate most importantly. My lashes never seem to say curled and less I use a curler which is fine. This mascara not only did not separate but was so clumpy it literally gave me three lashes. I tried brushing it out with a separate comb and that did not help.  I had to actually wipe this mascara off and ruin my eye make up because I could not go out and look that way. Although weekend I decided to try it again and a ply it with a different technique and I had the same outcome. This is the worst mascara I have used in sometime and usually with a comb I can make stuff work but this I could not. I'm not sure if it's the formula or the brush or both but you are much better spending money on even a drugstore products before buying this .",
