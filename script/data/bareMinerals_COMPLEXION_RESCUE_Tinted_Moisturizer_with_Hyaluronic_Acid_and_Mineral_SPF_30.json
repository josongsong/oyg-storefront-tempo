        "comments": "I used to the old formula daily...the one without the Hyaluronic acid in it!   However, my skin cannot tolerate this acid. I now have had puffy eyes, especially underneath. My eyelids have been covered with tiny dry flakes of skin; it is awful. I am not typically sensitive to any products, but my allergist and I have narrowed it down to the Hyaluronic acid. I have to find an alternative without this. The former formulas was the best, and I had used it for years!!",

It leaves you with a nice dewy, natural glow that is amazing. Very light and easy to apply. Its also buildable up to medium coverage. One layer is enough for me though. I applied with the Real Techniques Miracle Sponge. It does transfer somewhat, but it doesn't bother me. It leaves a weird rusty smell after it sets into the skin, but it goes away soon after. I will purchase again! ♥",

        "comments": "I really, really wanted to love this product.  I've worn BM powder (original) for years and years, and it's the only makeup that doesn't cause breakouts.  Full disclosure, I have very acne prone skin, and I can tell within just a few days if a product is going to exacerbate my acne. This product did just that---it happened fast, and it was oh so bad.  Big, cystic-like acne, even in spots where I don't normally break out (temples, next to nose, etc). I've discontinued using it, and my face is getting better after 3 weeks, but still has lingering pimples and red marks.  \n\nThis product was icky on it's own---it settles in any dry spots or flaky skin and seems to highlight them.  If you have an existing blemish, get ready for that to seem magnified with this product.\n\nI suspect that this is a great formulation for people with great skin.  If you don't need much coverage, if you have no blemishes, are not acne prone, etc., this might be for you. But if you like some coverage and a natural-appearance to your makeup, skip this one.  It's bad, and it's going back.",
