It also smells nice and I like the foaming action. A little goes a long way, so I think the size is fine. Because of how much it foams up, you need less than a pea sized amount.",

I had to use it for a couple of weeks to start to see a difference. I hope they never stop making it. Simply wonderful!! :)",

LET ME TELL YOU, this stuff *points with thumb and a smug look* this stuff is great. I've been using it for 3 weeks, and although i still have minor acnes shenanigans once in a while, for te most part my skin is clear, moisturized and overall the best for my skin. Which, my skin, is combination, super sensitve and prone to blackheads and the like. gross right? but, i havent had any of these problems since using this product. and you use so little of it... So if you're THAT girl, that's like hemming and hawing over whether or not to slap down the money for this miracle worker and get the results you want, well here is my suggestion, DONT BE THAT GIRL. just buy it. trust me.",

LET ME TELL YOU, this stuff *points with thumb and a smug look* this stuff is great. I've been using it for 3 weeks, and although i still have minor acnes shenanigans once in a while, for te most part my skin is clear, moisturized and overall the best for my skin. Which, my skin, is combination, super sensitve and prone to blackheads and the like. gross right? but, i havent had any of these problems since using this product. and you use so little of it... So if you're THAT girl, that's like hemming and hawing over whether or not to slap down the money for this miracle worker and get the results you want, well here is my suggestion, DONT BE THAT GIRL. just buy it. trust me.",

I really like the scent of this, but I also wish it was scented at the same time as fragrance isn't good for the skin. If you like foaming cleansers and want a cleanser that leaves your skin squeaky clean, then I guess this one is right for you, but is just isn't for me.",
