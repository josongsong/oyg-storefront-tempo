Why were they useless? Mostly because I am very sensitive - and they contained harsh products - so I tried charcoal and banana skin and honey and they all calmed but didn't cure and I tried other stronger Effaclar products but they were too strong but the amazing Clariyling solution is fantastic - it is only 0.5 salysilic and that is just the amount my skin can bear and you have no idea how the improvement in my skin is uplifting me - I can look at myself again and see the pretty girl I used to be - thankyou so much.",

Because of this I was sooo happy and thought I'd *finally* found a toner I can tolerate. However, I was using this on my chest, neck, and face maybe 2-3 times a week and I noticed that I was developing little acne breakouts after using this product, and I think it could be because of the hydrogenated castor oil included in the formula. Bummer. I really liked the strength of the glycolic acid and the low salicylic acid content, but I'll have to keep looking for a suitable toner.",
