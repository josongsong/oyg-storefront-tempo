Dont know if that's a real thing lol) but it comes off mostly in chunks, but if allowed to sit wet for a while it can bleed. Its buildable which is important becausd i like to curl, put a coat on, curl again, another coat, and repeat until im satisfied. I have thin and straight eyelashes and this is one of the only current mascaras that hot these suckers up long term without being impossible to remove. The quality does vary slightly among the color selection, and i usually forget which is the best when im buying another go figure, but i believe 'very black' is the most buildable, least clumpy and most durable for curl hold.",

There is no clumping, no smudging, just absolutely perfectly curled, defined lashes. They make my eyes the definite focal point of my face, and my eyes look totally amazing now.    If they are ever going to take it off the market, i'd love to know, so I could get all ............its that good!!!!  AMAZING PRODUCT!!!",

It definitely does what it says... after 2 coats, my lashes look fabulous! I don't care for waterproof, as I feel that it is too harsh on my lashes when trying to remove it. So I always buy regular. Well I don't know if they have changed the formula since the last time I bought it or what... but I've used it twice now and both times I've gone to remove it (VERY gently with makeup remover) I've noticed my eyelashes falling out! Like, way more than normal. Probably about 6 from each eye. It sucks because I love the effect it gives me, but it's not worth having my eyelashes fall out! I even wanted to like it so much, that I googled to see if anyone else is having the same issue. And it appears that I am not the only one. I think that's worth noting.",
