It's disappointing especially when i had such full hair, & now its so thin & no volume. If it wasnt past the 60 days i would return every Olaplex product I bought in March.",

I shampoo'd late and my hubby was already in bed. I didn't want to disturb him w/my dryer, so I let my hair dry naturally. \nFor reference my hair is dry, frizzy, thick, coarse, wavy, color treated, highlighted, and cut in a pixie / shag combo. \nI'm on day 3 and LOVING my hair!!! I used my normal routine: Alterna Caviar Replenishing Moisture Shampoo, Color Wow Coco-Motion Conditioner, followed by Color Wow Money Mask (LUV the $$$ Mask SCENT - YUM!!!). After towel dry: Olaplex Bonding Oil No. 7, Color Wow Dream Cocktail Coconut Infused Hydrating Leave In, and Color Wow Dream Coat.  \nAfter letting it dry a little bit longer, while still barely damp, I sprayed the Olaplex Volumizing Blow Dry Mist thru my roots and crown … and did NOT blow dry it! The SOFTNESS, SHINE, LIFT and SWELLING of my hair was instant … and amazing! I could not believe it … I've never experienced that before! And - day 3 - it has NOT deflated or flattened out! The body, lift, shine, softness, and bounce is beautiful! I've even doused it a few more times, and used the dryer for a little more \"oomph\" and it just gets MORE amazing!!! I am so fussy about NOT having my hair FEEL like it has \"stuff\" in it! It doesn't FEEL \"producty,\" crunchy, or dirty AT ALL. Thx, OLAPLEX! THIS ONE's a HIT!!!",

I could tell a difference in such a short amount of time. By spraying a little small amount and working it through my hair and blow drying it. It gave me instant volume. My hair is a lot healthier, shiner, and softer. My hair is a lot more manageable as well. I love that it is an protectant and provides transformation to my hair. I definitely recommend trying it.",

        "comments": "I recently purchased the OLAPLEX bundle with high hopes for transforming my hair. However, after consistently following the instructions and using the products as directed, I am extremely disappointed with the lack of results.\n\nFirst and foremost, the price of the bundle was quite steep, and I expected noticeable improvements in my hair's health and appearance. Regrettably, I didn't see any significant change after using the products for an extended period.\n\nFurthermore, I had anticipated a considerable difference in the overall condition of my hair, especially given the product's claims to repair and strengthen damaged strands. Unfortunately, my hair felt just as lackluster and dry as before, with no visible improvement in its texture or shine.\n\nOverall, I must admit that OLAPLEX did not live up to the hype for me. Considering the hefty price tag, I expected a noticeable transformation, but the results were underwhelming and certainly not worth the investment. I would advise potential buyers to carefully consider other options before purchasing the OLAPLEX bundle.",
