This cream does a very good job at moisturizing my eye area and softening the fine lines. It does a pretty decent job with puffiness, as well. I wish that it was a bit more brightening, but for what it is and the price, it's definitely hard to beat.",

I use the COSRX Snail Mucin Cleanser, Power Essence Serum, Eye Cream, and All In One Cream, combined with a Mario Badescu toner and a multitude of The Ordinary treatments to form a personalized and highly effective skin care regimen that has made my skin look and feel tighter, firmer, healthier, and younger. On days when I'm in a rush, the Snail Mucin line is my go-to and is effective on its own, but combined with a few Ordinary products, it's the most amazing skin care regimen I have ever used. I have had bags and wrinkles around my eyes since I was a teenager and this is the first product since the Arbonne RE9 eye cream (ridiculously expensive and hard to find) which has given me any noticeable results. Frankly, this is better than Arbonne. I look years younger.",

Depressing the pump gently provides a tiny amount… Way less than you would use. Needing to do that several times per eye. \n\nIf you press it a little harder, it goes crazy and gives you more than you would need for your whole face. \nWhat a mess!",

        "comments": "I received this product for free, in exchange for my unbiased opinion. I am a huge fan! The Advanced Snail Peptide Eye Cream is one of the newest additions to CosRx's lineup, and as always CosRx didn't disappoint. The main ingredient in this product is snail secretion filtrate constituting 72% of the formula. Snail secretion filtrate is mainly known for its skin-rejuvenating properties; it calms the skin, takes away redness, and helps with wrinkles. We can also find excellent antioxidants such as and allantoin, arginine, niacinamide, panthenol, and vitamin E. All help calm and improve the condition of the skin. There are also peptides which strengthen the skin and assist it to function better. On top of that, the formula includes a lot of humectants & emollients, and it's fragrance-& dye-free.\n\nFew words on snail mucin (snail secretion filtrate) production, it isn't as gruesome as media and bloggers portrayed it a few years ago. Actually, no animals are tortured for harvesting snail slime as stressed out snails produce low-quality slime. A few months ago, I read an article in a local newspaper about snail mucin production, as Italy is one of the biggest producers of the ingredient in the world. Snail mucin from Italian snails is in many Asian skincare products as the demand for the component is small in Europe, and it is mostly produced for export. In the article, it was explained how the animals are used for the production of snail mucin. Technically, snails live in a zoo-type of setting; they are placed in dome-shaped, glass terrariums with an absorbent mesh on the bottom. As the snails slither, the mesh gathers their slime. One in a while, their ooze is collected and turned into snail secretion filtrate. So, no torture or harm is involved; the snails are like bees that live in beehives and make honey. \n\nThe cream has a consistency of a bouncy gel. When applied, it stays on the skin and creates a protective layer which takes a bit of time to soak in. Does it work? Absolutely, this eye cream mended the damage that had been caused by Iope's cream. It helps me to control eczema around my eyes, and it keeps my eye area hydrated and fresh-looking. I have some small lines around my eyes, and this product did not vanish them but made them look less prominent. It's understandable as it's not a product intended for erasing lines, but for improving the look of your skin. Overall, the skin around my eyes looks much better when I use the product, and when I don't. I would say that the effects are not cumulative, so you have to use the eye cream consistently; like with any other product of this sort. \n\nThis is a great choice if you want to incorporate a specific product for your eye area, also for people who begin using eye creams. It's perfect for all skin types, there are no particularly irritating ingredients. If you look for a product that improves the look of your skin and moisturises well, then this one is worth a go. Though be aware that this eye cream is not an intensive anti-wrinkle treatment, CosRx suggest it for people in their 20s and 30s.",

They definitely feel more moisturized, but as for brightening and de-piuffing, I cant see a difference at all.\nIt may be hard to brighten, due to my dark tan complexion, but overall I dont think I would recommend the product. It has a pleasant smell and texture, and is hydrating, but as for the other claims, I would so far say it is lackluster.",
