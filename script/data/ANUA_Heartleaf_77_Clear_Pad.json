I've tried so many different toners and find that most have been so stripping or ineffective on my skin type. Having had success with other Korean skincare brands for serums and moisturizers, I decided to pick up ANUA's toning pads for another try at toners. I love the packaging, the tweezers have a dedicated spot so you can grab a pad without dirtying the lot or resting the tweezers on the product. I really appreciate that there are 70 pads in here so I feel less wasteful using them morning and night without having to repurchase frequently. I think I noticed a difference in my skin after a week of using so I'm also happy that this is effective in addition to just being a nice product.",

I have been using these pads for a month or so and I can say that I see and feel a huge difference in my skin! It tightens my pores without it feeling dry, it leaves my skin ready to absorb my serums, creams and sunscreen. It is a fragrance free product and so gentle for an exfoliating product, which makes it great for all skin types! This product is great because it uses natural, yet effective ingredients loved the fact that it came with small tweezers to pick up the pads without contamination to the other pads that sit in the jar!",

        "comments": "I've been hearing so much buzz about ANUA, and the Heartleaf 77 Clear Pad was the first product I've had the pleasure of trying and it did not disappoint!\n\nFirst off, the packaging is brilliant. The built-in tweezers are a game-changer for sanitary product dispensing. No more dipping my fingers into the jar! This small detail shows the brand's commitment to hygiene, which I really appreciate.\n\nAs for the pads themselves, they're fantastic. The heartleaf extract is incredibly soothing and calming. I love the gentle exfoliation the pads provide. It's not harsh or irritating, but just enough to slough away dead skin cells and leave my skin feeling smoother and brighter.\n\nUsing these pads has become a relaxing part of my skincare routine. My skin feels refreshed, hydrated, and noticeably clearer. I've noticed a reduction in redness and irritation, and my pores seem less visible.\n\nIf you're looking for a gentle exfoliating toner pad that's both effective and soothing, the ANUA Heartleaf 77 Clear Pad is definitely worth trying. It's living up to all the hype, and I can't wait to explore more of ANUA's products!",

It got Pha which exfoliates your face and neck, give them a nice and radiant looking glow and control the oil from your face. This product not only exfoliates your skin but also you a glowey and brighter look. It brightens your complexion out and make you look radiant and beautiful. Also it hydrates your face and not like any other exfoliating product, it strips everything out of you and make your skin dry like a desert. Also it clears out the complexion and make your pores looks smaller than before. Like I have seen on my face, that the bigger pores were more invisible and the other pores were gone. Moreover the packaging was convenient as well as easy to carry around while traveling.",

        "comments": "After using the ANUA Heartleaf 77 Toner Pads every night for a week, I'm genuinely impressed by how they've transformed my skin. These pads balance soothing hydration and gentle exfoliation, making them a delightfully easy addition to my routine.\nWhat sets these apart is their versatility. The 70 generously soaked pads are perfect for my face, neck, and even elbows, leaving my skin feeling smoother and cared for. It's a little extra pampering that makes a big difference.\nFrom the very first use, I could feel the gentle exfoliation working to lift away dead skin cells without a hint of irritation. After seven days, my skin is noticeably softer, with rough patches smoothed out and my complexion looking more refined. Even my T-zone, which often feels oily, has improved—fewer blackheads, tighter pores, and an overall fresher feel.\nThe star ingredient, 77% Heartleaf Extract, has been a breakthrough for my sensitive skin. It calms redness and irritation while delivering lightweight hydration that never feels greasy or heavy. The alcohol-free formula relieves anyone who worries about drying or stripping their skin.\nBut these pads don't stop at exfoliation and hydration—they also provide antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits that support long-term skin health. Knowing that every swipe contributes to a calmer, healthier complexion makes them feel like a luxurious yet practical choice.\nIf you're looking for an all-in-one skincare product that gently exfoliates, hydrates, and balances your skin, the ANUA Heartleaf 77 Toner Pads are worth trying. In just one week, I've seen my skin transform, and I'm excited to see if continued use will help me achieve that coveted glass-skin glow.\n \n***This review was collected as part of a promotion ***",

        "comments": "The ANUA Heartleaf Toner pad was a great way for me to include a toner into my routine without the fuss. The target of this Toner + Pad duo was to combine the benefits of both a hydrating Toner & Exfoliation by effectively trying to make possible that more reactive skin types get the benefits of exfoliation. The key ingredients of PHAs(PolyHydroxy Acids), Heartleaf, and Madecassoside aimed to give a gentle but effective exfoliating experience. The pads themselves don't carry a lot of product; but if you tip the container upside down then they'll be an even distribution of product on the most immediate pads. I used this every two days, because while the molecular weight of the exfoliating agents are larger than say your more known BHAs & AHAs. You can still overdo it especially with the added element of the physical property of the pad itself if you don't rub gently enough. The product on application leaves a tacky feel that I disliked, even so it doesn't interfere with follow up skin care steps. I'm using this my skin did get a reduction of redness from a new pimple. It immediately soothed the inflammation around my pimple and the texture (from old pitted scars/pores) was still there but slightly less obvious. I've been using this on my cheeks/neck/hands for the last week. In doing so I did notice I got Closed Comedones on my chin + cheeks. So I would say if you're prone to that test this out as there are fatty alcohols in here.",
