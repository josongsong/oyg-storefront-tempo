        "comments": "I have a love hate relationship with the mascara. When you first apply the mascara it gives a lifted look but over time this mascara has lots of fall out. You know those black specks that end up under your eyes or on your cheeks. I tend to get lots of that after 2-3 hours of having the mascara on. I also feel like the applictor is great for the top lashes but I feel like the big applicator makes it annoying to put on the bottom lashes. I will say for the price point this mascara is pretty good when it comes to lifting the lashes the biggest con for me is the fall out.",

        "comments": "I wanted to love this product, as ive always heard good things about this brand ans i love brown mascaras at a budget friendly price. Within just a few hours my eyes were tearing and absolutely burning. When i went to look in the mirror, the mascara had flaked and transferred a ton. It also made my eye lashes pull down as if the product was too heavy, i have never had with any other mascaras and have a natural curl to my lashes, so this was a big surprise. With how badly it made my eyes burn im hesitant to try again. As a disclaimer, I do have sensitive eyes, but have never had a mascara bother them so quick and have the irritation stick around after removing and using drops.",
