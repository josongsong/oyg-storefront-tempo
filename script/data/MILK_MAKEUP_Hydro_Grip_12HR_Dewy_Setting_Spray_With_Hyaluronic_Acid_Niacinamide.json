First off, I had to purchase it twice - the nozzle broke immediately the first time and I couldn't figure out how to get the product out without breaking the bottle; it AGAIN broke immediately the second time but I was able to pour the product into an empty spray bottle this time. Now, I get that it's supposed to be hydrating and \"dewy,\" but as soon as I first sprayed it I noticed it NEVER seemed to set - it just stayed wet and tacky, which I HATED. My face feels greasy rather than freshly made up, and sure enough, within a few hours my makeup is a total mess and looks completely melted off like it would on a humid, sweaty day. It just looks and feels so gross. I know everyone is different but I genuinely can't imagine how it has such a high rating when even someone whose skin is on the dry side ends up a greaseball.",

I got this complimentary from Influenster in my Clean Beauty VoxBox this month for my honest review and was super excited to try it as I've heard nothing but great things about it! The hype is real and I definitely recommend getting this! I used it as a primer and setting spray. It has a very light tacky feel to it when used as a primer so it adheres your makeup to your skin really well. As a setting spray, it melts your powder into your skin so it looks like your skin to make the powder seamless! It's so lightweight and a little goes a long way. I like the finish and it kept my skin looking flawless all day even with wearing a mask and sweating while exercising at physical therapy. There's no strong scent so it's great to use and not have to worry about sensitivity to scent or coughing up a lung because it's too strong. The spray nozzle on the bottle is phenomenal which was one of the first things I noticed. I definitely would recommend this spray!",
