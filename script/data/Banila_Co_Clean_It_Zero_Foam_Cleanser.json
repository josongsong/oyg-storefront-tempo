The foam texture is very luxurious feeling compared to other cleansers in a similar price range - my fiancé likes it so much that he now washes his face every night with this. My only complaint is this isn't great at removing waterproof or heavy makeup, but it doesn't claim to be able to do so unlike their cleansing balms, so I'm not going to dock a star for that.",

I know, might be weird, but I like having a face cleaner that foams a bit. I have also used the cleansing balm this company makes and it works effectively, but this cleaner is great. I love that you have to use the smallest amount and it goes a long way and lathers up and cleans effectively. It has a nice smell as well. I always wet my face before applying. I apply a peanut amount and lather in my hands slightly before applying. Also, I have somewhat dry skin and this is not over-drying.",

It smells like a freshly cleaned public restroom or diaper-ish smell. Rating this a 3 (1 for the smell and a 5 for effectiveness). Got a sample and would not buy, but would use if free.",

It foams really well and really fast but in a thick consistency so it doesn't feel like that satisying bubbly type of foam. Just thick and /almost/ tough to lather all around the skin. I wish I knew someone who loves it so I can give my bottle to. I don't want it to go to waste.",

I've purchased this at least 4 times now and will continue to do so. I've tried other face washes but none of them works as well as this one. A little bit goes a very long way so you're definitely getting your moneys worth (probably even more). No need for double cleansing with this. When I use a toner pad afterwards, there's no dirt on it like there would be with other cleanser. I was actually very surprised. Highly HIGHLY recommend.",

Now I will be the first to admit that cleansing my face is probably the step in my skincare routine that I enjoy the least. I've heard about the double cleanse method for awhile, and tried different variations of it, but they were just too much of a hassle. Since trying banila's products, I actually look forward to cleansing my face. It has become a time to relax and remove the impurities of the day. This cleanser is perfect to follow up with after using a cleansing balm. You only need the smallest amount and it works into a creamy lather that rinses away easily to reveal soft, clean, supple skin. Most foaming cleansers I have tried leave my skin feeling stripped of all moisture. More recently I have been using a hydrating cleanser that doesn't lather at all, but although it is gentle, I don't feel like it is as effective at actually cleaning away dirt, makeup, and whatever impurities have collected on my face throughout the day. \n\nI was just super impressed with this cleanser and will consider purchasing in the future, after I've used up all of the other cleansers I have in my line up. My skin is combination, so I think this would be a good cleanser for most skin types.",

Because of this, I stay away from cleansers with fragrance because as tend to be irritating. I didn't see a fragrance listed on the ingredients for this cleanser but it did have a soft powdery scent that I actually really liked, not overpowering at all. The problem I had with this cleaner actually has nothing to do with my skin, which it left soft and well-hydrated, but my EYES. Every single time I used it, it stung my eyes like crazy! There is an ingredient in there that is irritating to my very resilient eyeballs (I'm a contact lens wearer and have high tolerance for things touching my eyes). It's not like I'm washing my face with my eyes wide open or anything—I have them shut tightly just like I do with all the other cleansers I've used in my life! Something in there migrates and stings my eyes in a way other cleansers have not done before. Such a shame because I love everything else about it. If you're interested in trying out this cleanser I recommend you get a sample of it first to make sure your eyeballs will vibe with it.",
