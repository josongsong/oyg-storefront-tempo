It's kind of frothy when mixed with water, and it comes out of the container in the perfect amount, which I think is great no guess work needed. I need to purchase the toner to try with this. Great price too. Skin is soft and smooth. Overall clarity is bright. Pores look smaller and smoother. Highly recommend, ladies. Lee A",

Once you get the powder wet it then dissolves and becomes a more foamy type of cleanser. It leaves skin feeling instantly softer, due to the exfoliating properties it has, and makes skin instantly brighter and more glowing!\nIt quickly and easily removes any and all makeup, dirt, etc from the skin while cleansing. It even removes waterproof mascara easily!\nI do want to note, that although this face cleanser does not irritate my skin (which is prone to being sensitive with certain products) , if I don't use some kind of moisturizer afterwards my skin does end up being pretty dry the following day! So DONT forget to use your moisturizers afterwards!",

Once mixed with water it reminds me of bean essence. I let it sit on my face for five minutes like a face mask. It gives your skin a slip and shine. I love the instant brightness and that it has a nice lather especially for my combination skin type. I like the compact packaging and that Anua products are reasonably priced. This cleanser pairs nicely with the Anua cleansing oil. Plus it's great to see the benefits of using rice on my skin as opposed to hair products. Using this is beneficial for evening out your skin tone. Overall, I would recommend this rice cleanser and give it five out of five stars.",

The powder formula was very unique as it served as a cleanser and exfoliator in one. It has many great benefits for the skin. My skin felt a lot more smoother because of the exfoliating rice enzymes. It felt squeaky clean especially after a long day of wearing makeup. What I loved most is that it didn't dry out my skin. My skin actually felt more hydrated and soft after use. It's gentle enough for daily use or on days when your skin is feeling dull. I dispensed about a half teaspoon into my hands and it was the perfect amount to get a good lather and thoroughly cleanse my skin. And can I just say it gives me the perfect smooth skin for makeup application? No more dry patches of skin. This is definitely something I will be keeping in my routine.",

        "comments": "It's out with the old and in with the new with this one. This compact product is glowness on the go! I love how the packaging is perfect for travel. I tend to overindulge when it comes to cleansing but a little bit of powder goes a long way. It emulsifies on impact and the product reminds me of dermalogica's microfoliant except the particles are sized bigger and the texture can feel a little bit more grainy on impact like a scrub. Making it the perfect dupe for a $60 product. Even though it is the same price as Dermalogica's Microfoliant mini, you are still getting more powder with Anua.\n\nFrom the first use, my skin immideately looked less dull. I have been dealing with texture, acne flares, and added dryness thanks to the season, but using this cleanser allowed the rest of my products absorb easier. When pairing powder with the hydrating barrier serum I noticed an acne scar I had has been slowing fading. By adding an oil cleanser, radiance masks like Tata Harper or detox masks like Malin + Goetz, moisturizer i.e. La Roche Posay, and a sunscreen when needed; my skin has evened out significantly. I usually would add an undereye retinol alternative treatment to lighten the dark circles but I don't necessarily need it with this regimen.\n\nI would recommend not using this product every day to avoid overexfoilating and overcleansing because it can disrupt your moisture barrier. I tested using this product everyday for a week and by day four, I noticed light irritation bumps. So this can be used as a midweek (3 days max) cleanser. To my understanding, if you plan on using this daily PLEASE be consistent with sunscreen as your skin will be more sensitive to sunlight. They even warn you on the box. Also, try double cleansing with this product for a deeper clean and luxuriously lush feel; your skin will feel like butter. There is not scent and if you are like me trying to fade hyperpigmentation and ingredients like Vitamin C causes heavy irritation, this is a product for you. \n\nAfter cleansing, I like that my skin doesn't feel tight or dehydrated instead it becomes the perfect bouncy base for my following products. My pores are also tighter.\n\nStart the year off fresh with this Rice Enzyme Brightening Cleansing Powder!",

        "comments": "I have likes and dislikes with the Anua Rice Enzyme Brightening Cleansing Powder. I love the rice enzyme base and the fact that it comes in a powder form. I like the brightening effect on my skin and the Ceramide complex. It also contains papain to help lightly exfoliate, my skin needs a light exfoliation every day so I thought this cleanser would be perfect for me. This cleanser is very hydrating and easy to use. I simply shake a little powder into my damp hands and lightly rub my hands together. If I need more water I will add a bit more to a few fingertips. I don't like that this product doesn't get very foamy like it claims. I've tried adding more water and less water and even whipping it with a fan brush. It just doesn't get foamy. It does get slimy. It felt like I was using a slimy cleanser on my skin. My skin did feel nice and clean after rinsing with water, but I don't think this is a cleanser I'd use often. Working in the beauty industry for over 20 years, I would recommend it to someone without texture issues and someone with drier skin. I like that this cleanser really isn't scented and I like the simplicity of the bottle it comes in. I also think it would be great for travel or in the gym/overnight bag.",
