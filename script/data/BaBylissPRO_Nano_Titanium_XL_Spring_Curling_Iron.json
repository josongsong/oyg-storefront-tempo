The curls from the BioIonic lasted 5 minutes and my hair is the kind of hair that will hold a curl for days on end. I have thick, coarse, wavy, frizzy hair and was able to curl all my hair with the BabyBliss in 30 minutes on the 355 degrees setting. Brushed out to waves beautifully. So happy with my purchase.",

        "comments": "I purchased this product after noting it is the brand my hair stylist uses. I have stubbornly straight hair any many other curling irons do not put a lasting curl in my hair. This iron has me stunned I have curls that hold for days now. \n\nThe longer barrel makes curling my hair when it was longer much easier and now with shorter hair, it goes so quickly. I like that it has a temperature gauge instead of odd arbitrary numbers. The button is recessed and requires a long press to turn on and off  so no accidental shut offs while it is in operation. The clamp is strong and holds my thin hair in place securely without pulling or being difficult to press or operate. The kick stand is small and flimsy but I just make sure to set it on something with a bit of grip when heated up to prevent any burns.",

I lowered it to the first setting (285°F), but the issue persisted. Even after turning it off, the curling iron remained extremely hot 20 minutes later.",

My hair holds curl very well, with other curling irons and even straighteners. When I curl my hair with the Babyliss, the curls do not even stay until my whole head it done. Within an hour my hair has zero curl. This has NEVER happened curling other brands. I have used multiple different methods and all different products to try and make this curling iron work well. I am so upset I missed the window to return this item.",

Unfortunately, there are a couple of what I would consider design flaws. \n1) The way the clamp is designed, the part where you press to open the clamp is very close to metal that gets very hot from the curling iron, and both she and I keep missing the right spot to put our finger and kept burning ourselves. \n2) There is a portion at the top of the barrel where it's not metal, and there is a small protrusion on it for some reason, and that snags the hair as we unwind the curling iron. See picture for a better understanding of what I mean.\nWe really wanted to love this, but it was a miss for us.",

One of the things I love about it is the multiple temperature settings which make it easy to use on my thick and dense hair. The curls come out perfectly every time and the iron heats up quickly and maintains a consistent temperature, preventing any heat damage to my hair.\n\nThe curling iron is also very user-friendly and easy to use, with a comfortable grip and a long swivel cord that allows for flexibility while styling. Another feature I appreciate is the automatic shut-off function, which gives me peace of mind knowing that the iron won't stay on and potentially cause any damage.\n\nOverall, the Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium XL Spring Curling Iron is an amazing product that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a reliable and versatile curling iron. Its multiple temperature settings, ease of use, and safety features make it a must-have for anyone who wants to achieve salon-quality curls at home.",

There are five temperature settings up to 430 degrees.  It has a cool tip to grip and help handle the curling iron without getting burned. I was given this curling iron for free in exchange for my honest review.  I really wanted to like it.\n\nI was very disappointed in the curl and hold.  My hair typically is easy to curl and holds curls for a long time.  I had trouble getting much curl at all even though I wound it up all the way to my scalp on the hottest setting and held it until my hair was heated through very well.  Only the ends were slightly curled.  And as soon as I fingered through the curls they were gone. This just will not do.  I spent a lot of time trying to get my hair to curl and with this curling iron, it seems impossible. Afterwards my hair looks stringy.  I cannot recommend this to anyone.",
