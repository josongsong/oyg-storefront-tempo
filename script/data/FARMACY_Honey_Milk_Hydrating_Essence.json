        "comments": "I was gifted by Farmacybeauty in exchange for an honest review, but this is actually my second bottle. I've already used up an entire Honey Milk from when it first was released.\n\nThey've made some changes since then---the label on the bottle is now transparent instead of white, which is a nice plus because you can actually see how much is left! The glass bottle and the white plastic cap feel a little bit lighter/cheaper IMO, but not significantly so. The little plastic drip mechanism in the top seems to be about the same as before or maybe a bit better, not sure if it is actually slightly easier than before or if I'm just used to it at this point.\n\nThat said, the drip mechanism is still the worst part of the product. I guess as a positive it's literally impossible to spill it without breaking the bottle, but it's a bit annoying that you can't just pour a small amount into your hands, you have to tap each single drop out against your finger/hand/cotton round. You could pull the whole plastic component out of the glass bottle but then the opening is pretty large, so it's not the best alternative.\n\nBeyond that, it's a lovely product. It's not super hydrating on its own to me but it helps a lot with calming irritated or inflamed skin. It helps clear up redness from irritation and seems to help my skin recover faster when I've overdone it on actives (although it does sting a touch when going on in that case). It seems to help serums soak in to my skin a bit better and I like layering it underneath my tret (letting the Honey Milk dry first before applying the tret) to help prevent skin peeling/flaking.\n\nThe bottle lasts a good while too. I think I got about 7-8 months of daily use out of my first one, so the value is pretty great!\n\nNo issue with breakouts from this one despite acne prone skin, and I don't think it has any added fragrance but you can definitely smell the honey and chamomile. The texture really is quite similar to a thin milk, not so runny it'll drip through your hands (I just tap it into my fingers to apply to my face) but just before that in viscosity",

The texture feels nice when I apply the product, but it just doesn't provide much hydration. I've tried using it on both dry and damp skin, as well as layering it, but my skin still doesn't feel very hydrated. On top of that, the bottle design is frustrating—I find it difficult to get a sufficient amount of product out since it comes out just one drop at a time. A few pros are that it doesn't irritate my skin and doesn't have any overbearing scent. While I plan to keep using it to see if things improve, it's been a disappointment given the hype.",
