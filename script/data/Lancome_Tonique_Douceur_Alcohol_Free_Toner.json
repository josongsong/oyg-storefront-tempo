I will use up the bottle but doubt I will purchase again.  They need to redesign the dispenser opening because it is way too easy to dispense too much product and that is a waste, especially at this price point.",

It contains eucalyptus and clove oils. It goes down into your pores and acts as antibacterial. Use cotton ball with it too. Then apply the toner. Then apply a light moisturizer. Go bare or makeup. Those pre-steps are your defense against makeup getting down in your pores. This toner is also great on lips and nails.",

It is a humectant that is able to draw moisture from the environment and hydrate the skin. But the rest of the ingredients are underwhelming. There is a strong perfume like smell and enough blue dye to stain your bathroom counter if it spills. There are sooooooo many better toners out there.",

I felt like it worked with my other skin care products and not against it. It is defiantly worth the price. Ive had bad experience with toners in the past but this one is far by the best for my skin.  Cons are that it can be messy because the hole where you pure the toner out of is large and it is very easy to waste it or use more than desired. Another con is that it has a fragrance.  I personally love the fragrance but for someone who has sensitive skin it may not be ideal. I was told it can used for all skin types but because it is so hydrating if one has oily skin it may or may not be too much in regards to hydration. But all in all dont take my word for it. Its a try it for yourself product.  Lacome products have never left me or my skin disappointed.",

It is a humectant that is able to draw moisture from the environment and hydrate the skin. But the rest of the ingredients are underwhelming. There is a strong perfume like smell and enough blue dye to stain your bathroom counter if it spills. There are sooooooo many better toners out there.",
