This cleanser is gentle and really gets my skin clean (I pair it with the Anua Heartleaf cleansing oil to double-cleanse my makeup off.) Just remember when reading reviews, everyone's skin is different and what works for some doesn't work for others It's important to pay attention to the ingredients and gain an understanding of what your skin will tolerate. I've had other products I've used where it worked great at first then I developed an allergic reaction after weeks of use. I love this cleanser and am glad to have found one that works well for my skin. Good luck!",

(its the snail rescue purifying cleanser by peach slices. i love it so much!!)",

I had clear skin when all of a sudden on the 6th week of use my face broke out SOO BAD, red hives all over my face, irritation and swelling. I honestly thought it was an allergic reaction to something i had eaten, until the next morning i washed my face and the same thing happened. Ive discontinued using this cleanser and my face is much happier. Took about a week to fully heal.",

My only caveat is that it does sting a bit if some suds get in my eyes; which has not been an issue with the last couple cleansers that I've used.",
