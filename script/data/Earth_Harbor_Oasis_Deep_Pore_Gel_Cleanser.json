I normally have BAD breakouts with cleansers for some reason, so I gave this a try since it's vegan and all the ingredients looked natrual (I'm a cruelty free babe) The cleanser didnt really work too well removing makeup, so I had to use it around 3 times in a row to make it work. It ended up making my face break out as badly as it did in high school, and I'm 29.. :( I used their moisturizer too after.\n2 weeks after stopping it, my face was starting to look better. Maybe I'm just allergic to an ingredient I don't know about. Still using the moisturizer and no problems with that. I actually love it",

I LOVE the Oasis Deep Pore Gel Cleanser. The color is beautiful, it smells amazing and it feels amazing!! I decided to do a skincare overhaul and basically went wild on the Earth Harbor products, essentially buying half of the products they offer and making my entire routine Earth Harbor. I want everything lol. I am an Ingredient nerd, and I love the ingredients that Ali went with for this Cleanser. Red Sea Moss, Chlorophyll, Sea foam, Baby's Breath and Lilac, Pear fruit extract, we have Lactobacillus Ferment and Panthenol for the skin barrier, I love the inclusion of the Ancient Sea Salt and White Willow Bark for skin texture, Acne, and Inflammation.  Everything about this Cleanser is 10/10. I love using it after the Ahoy Love Milky Cleanser..or after an oil Cleanser (soon to be the Sunshine Oil Cleanser when it comes in the mail lol.) Had a random breakout recently and Oasis cleared my skin right up 😊",

After two days, my skin instantly flared up with bumps and had the most intense itch I have ever felt on my face. I immediately stopped all products and this itching continued for the next 4 days with extreme flakiness. I tried everything to smooth it but it's difficult once it's gets irritated. For the next couple weeks I stuck to my usual routine and it finally calmed down. Then one day I decided to try the cleanser again thinking it was the cloudburst that gave me a reaction, turns out it was this cleaner. I used it in the morning and by evening I started getting a slight itch around my jawline then the next coming days the itching became more intense and migrated up my cheeks, etc. I really wanted to like this product, but something in it I must be allergic to. I'll be giving this product to my sister since it's s good product and I don't want to waste it.  It just didn't work for me.",
