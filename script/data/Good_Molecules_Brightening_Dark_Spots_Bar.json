I started using this soap and the next day in the shower noticed how white my gloves were, they looked new. I trust this soap cleans and exfoliates away dead skin and leaves you baby soft. I like to leave the lather on my skin a little longer before rinsing off, just to make sure the ingredients have time to work.  I definitely notice a difference in my skin, it's brighter and my hyperpigmentation spots are disappearing.",
