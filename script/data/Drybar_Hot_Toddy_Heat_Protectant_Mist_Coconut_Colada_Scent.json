As someone who has chronic migraines that can be triggered by heavily scented things, I have to buy non-scented products. \nThis dry shampoo smells heavily of coconut, which triggers my migraines. I also just generally hate the smell of coconut. \nIf this doesnt bother you, buy it I guess. Just know you'll smell like sunscreen all day.",

        "comments": "I bought this to replace the biolage one that I hated. This Hot Toddy can is small nut comes with a large price. I did not like that it can only be used on dry hair, I prefer to add my product when my hair is damp. The can is aerosol, so the mist chokes you when it comes out. My husband even told me to turn on the fan, but he's so sensitive about girl stuff.... My hair was dry, soft and shiny (I used Dry Bar Liquid Glass) after using my big ceramic round brush and my buttercup blow dryer (I'm all about dry bar!) SIDE NOTE: \n I don't always flat iron my hair, so I want something that also protects against the heat from the blow dryer. So I was left with pretty shiny hair with a curl at the ends. I applied the Hot Toddy spray and it was like I added a dull layer of spray over my hair, then I flat ironed it. The result was not one I was happy with at all, I could not run my fingers through my hair anymore and my shine was completely gone. I want heat protection and shine, I know there are other products out there that offer both but come with a price tag. This product has a laundry list of not so great ingredients. So if you're willing to dish out the money and are not worried about having the all natural, paraben free blah blah blah stuff. Keep looking, Paul Mitchell has a few good ones, comparable in price. I have very tick hair, past my shoulders and is color treated only at the roots very 6 weeks. I have a natural wave and lots of frizz. I hope this helps someone!",
