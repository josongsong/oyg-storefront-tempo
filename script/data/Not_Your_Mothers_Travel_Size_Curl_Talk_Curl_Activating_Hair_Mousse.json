The people here saying that its sticky just need to wash there hands I would say hair gel is more sticky. Next, it doesnt leave the hair crispy or sticky. YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR YOUR HAIR TO DRY. After a while the \"crunch\" goes away. You can use an oil if your impatient. I truley believe that this is one of the best mousse on the market, and Ive boughten probably 10+ cans. Im happy they know have a jumbo can at a reasonable price compared to high end brands.",

Unfortunately, It made my hair so so sticky though. it stuck to my shoulders and nexk and every time I touched my hair to move it out of my face or pull it to the side it left a sticky film on my hands. at least it defined my hair. so if you dont care about sticky, this is great. I just have sensory issues which made this whole product unusable for me",

I put a little in my damp hair and scrunch and my hair stays curly. So from my expiernce with not-so curly hair, it seems to work pretty well! Now for slickbackss.... AMAZING!!!! I have used so many products for slickbacks and this is the best one. It lasts ALL day so well, my fly aways stay down, it's easy to style because I have time to style and make it perfect before it dries, and it makes my hair look slick and shiny!!! I used lots at the beach when it was super windy, so I had hair that wasn't annoying but was still so cute. I used a bunch and I still have lots left. Great about and very affordable. 11/10 recommend!!!",
