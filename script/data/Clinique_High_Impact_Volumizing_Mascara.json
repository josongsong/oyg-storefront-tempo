I have very curled up semi voluminous natural lashes and after curling my lashes more there still wasnt much that the mascara did. It didnt add any more volume or length personally so i think if you have straight or downward pointed lashes this may not work well for you at all. The color also just didnt show up for me. It just looked dark I couldn't tell there was even a tint of color. It may be better with a white base but i thought for 26 dollars it might have a better color payoff. Thats on me I guess. The prose though are that it doesnt clump your lashes together and it gives your lashes a very natural look if thats what you want. And once it's dry it doesn't go anywhere for at least a few hours. Id likely check after a couple hours just to make sure. I did have some slight smudging on the bottom but it was pretty minimal after so many hours of wear. Regardless ill stick with my nars climax mascara personally < 3",

It gives my lashes length without getting clumpy. My only negative would be that it's marketed as a tubing mascara but it doesn't behave like one. It doesn't wash off in tubes, it just smears off like any other mascara. The zero gravity version is very very clearly a tubing mascara, while this is not. I'm still happy with it though!",

Half the time I'm removing the extra with a Q-tip, or trying to separate the lashes with a small eyelash brush. Even after taking off all my makeup the night before, the next morning I awake with smudges under my eyes from the mascara I didn't notice was still there. Will try another Clinque mascara to see if I find my all time favorite.",
