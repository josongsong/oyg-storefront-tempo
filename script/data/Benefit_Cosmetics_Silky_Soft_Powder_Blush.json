        "comments": "I needed a travel sized blush for trips and this one is perfect.  There are many shades available, which means it is easy to find the right one for your skin or mood.  The product does not come with an applicator, however I already had a travel sized brush, so it was not an issue for me.  Already taken it on two trips and so good so far.  I'm a bit concerned that since the package is cardboard, it might not last as long as a plastic one.  I do like that it is recyclable, however.",

I am beyond glad that I did! Dandelion is the most gorgeous color; it looks good on every skin tone I've tested it on, from my own very pale complexion to my best friend's lovely deep chocolate brown skin. It's beautifully subtle with one swipe and gives you a sweet apple-cheeked glow with two or three.\n\nAlso, the gorgeous thing about Benefit is that, while their products will cost more than what you'll find at the local big box, a little of anything Benefit makes goes a long way. I've had this box of Dandelion for well over a year, and I use it every single day. It still looks just as beautiful, it still smells gorgeous and fresh, and I can't even begin to imagine when it will start to run out.\n\nAlso, a note about the brush it comes with: I always tossed the brushes that came with my cheap blushes. They made the color look streaky and were just awful. And I very nearly tossed the brush that came with Dandelion, but I decided to test it first. Boy, am I glad I did! It's exactly the right width for swiping over cheeks, nose, chin, and forehead. Also, the bristles are super-soft. So give it a go!\n\nDandelion was my first Benefit purchase, but it wasn't my last. This was the product that got me to ditch my old makeup for good in favor of Benefit's absolutely wonderful line. A must-have for any makeup bag!",

I especially love the dandelion because it's light, blends well and I can wear it in the Winter when I'm pale as well as the Summer when I get tan. One reason I can justify spending the money on it is because in the past it has lasted me a long time, BUT... I was very disappointed when I ordered a new box only to see how much product is now being shorted, while charging the same price (or more). My old box Net wt was .42oz, now down to .25oz... really? I'm not sure I feel so good about spending that much money and getting almost half the product.",
