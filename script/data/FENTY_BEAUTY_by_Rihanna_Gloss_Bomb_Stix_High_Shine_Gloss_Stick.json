        "comments": "The Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb Stix is truly a standout addition to my beauty collection. As someone who values both luxury and functionality in makeup, this gloss stick effortlessly merges the two. The first thing you'll notice is its sleek packaging—sturdy, stylish, and easy to slip into any purse, making it perfect for on-the-go touch-ups. But the real magic happens upon application. The formula strikes the perfect balance between a lip gloss and a lipstick, offering a high-shine finish without any of the stickiness you often get with traditional glosses. The texture glides smoothly over the lips, providing a buttery feel that's deeply moisturizing, thanks to the infusion of lip-loving ingredients like Squalane, Vitamin E, Shea Butter, and Kiwi Oil. This blend locks in moisture for hours, leaving my lips looking plump and hydrated throughout the day. What sets the Gloss Bomb Stix apart from other lip products is its medium pigment payoff paired with that juicy shine. The color is rich without being overpowering, making it versatile enough for both daytime wear and evening glam. Personally, I've found shades like *Two'Lips Kiss* and *High'Biscus* to be ideal for every occasion, whether I'm going for a subtle, polished look or something more vibrant. Another major plus is how comfortable it feels—even after hours of wear. I don't have to worry about my lips drying out or the gloss settling into fine lines. For anyone looking for a product that combines shine, color, and nourishment, this is a must-try. Fenty Beauty has once again outdone themselves with a product that feels as luxurious as it looks!",

        "comments": "I was so excited to get the Gloss Bomb Stix High Shine by Fenty Beauty for the obvious reason - it's Fenty, so it's going to be great with two thumbs up. It's going to be a gorgeous color and a gorgeous new formulation. Very happy feet made their way to le postal (fake French for frou frou effect) to retrieve my package and joy of joys, it arrived! I opened the box and my elation courses through my veins. (This is after all, Fenty.) Per usual the packaging is gorgeous. Bliss! The tube portrays the color; mine is \"Sorta Selfish\", which is perfect for a Basic Beige chick like me. It's a lovely pinkish brown and I knew as soon as I saw the shade that I'd live in it. Opening it and taking that first scent of peachy vanilla was and memorable and gratifying. I tried the color on the back of my hand and jazzed to see the color payoff. This is not a regular gloss. It's a cross between a gloss and a lipstick, leaning a bit more on the lipstick side, hence the color payout. The gloss isn't overly sticky, which is the bane of every long haired person's existence. It's not going to attract those locks like keys, if you get my meaning. Sigh. Beyond that, I don't find anything new or exciting about it. I'm probably not going to purchase this in the near future. It may just be me but I don't enjoy applying it. The shape of the Gloss is an oversize (fat, for lack of a better term) oval. I find I can't apply it comfortably as it is. I have to turn it in a circle as I apply it to maintain contact with an edge on my lip line. Picture that if you can, there's no room for diagrams or even chalk really. For the price, I'd just as soon get a lipstick with a glossy sheen and wear my hair up. Sorry RiRi.",
