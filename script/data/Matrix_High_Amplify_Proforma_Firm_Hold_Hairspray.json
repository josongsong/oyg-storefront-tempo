I informed 'L…e' they're DEF not a Matrix & take note on who's been around for Decades w/out 'need' for advertising, freebies for high review from 🔥& still has loyal customers. I'm 55 & not too old to know what I'm doing/styling🙄I was model & in hair shows in 80's/90's I remember Co.'s using thier products on stage but when they 'set it'?? Rest assured they grabbed \"Matrix-Performa\"{liquid Gold or Cement' was nickname} to set it in place! It was & still is Amazing. I'd do a hair show in day & after go to sweaty Rock Concert @ night & party til birds were up & chirping @ sun rise! My hair went \"No Where\" & not stiff, hard. Matrix does keep reinventing w/times & when 1 product sells better than older?? Takes off shelf (unlike other Co.'s). This #1 I could never forget even thru the Partying & decades later a respect-able parent (grandparent🫢🤫) its even named like we talked \"performa\" cuz it'll \"perform ON Ya!\".  Matrix & Nexxus isnt going anywhere for reason & now I get the thinking behind not over advertising.. either people trust in you (& now me) & buy it or? They dont~doesnt matter STILL here!",
