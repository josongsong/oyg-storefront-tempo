While I dont think they changed the formula, they definitely changed the packaging and decreased the amount of product u get.

Any of the shades with the word Amber in them, depending on your skin depth, create a beautiful, natural shadow look (an actual contour!) as well as warmer shades for summer and shades all the way to ebony.  The shade range includes the fairest to deepest skin tones, and that is rare.  It also is beginner friendly since you can just draw it on and blend it out with nearly any sponge or brush.",

        "comments": "I have a fair, extremely cool toned complexion. This makes contouring a nightmare for me, because many companies enjoy combining the concepts of bronzer w/ contour, resulting in almost exclusively warm undertones even when they're advertised as neutral. Because of this, I have spent most of my life LOVING makeup and learning every other technique except for contour because any time I tried, my skin turned out muddy. I'm truly in awe of Rihanna's line - it's a complete testament to the inclusivity of this line that she was able to produce a product for fair-skin that STILL I have yet to see from ANY other company, despite many other companies almost exclusively pandering to pale skin for years (save for maybe 1 or 2 darker shades in a line of 60). The formula is awesome, it blends SO well - I don't usually wear foundation and it's creamy enough to blend into a seamless, natural shadow. It also truly glides on the skin with little effort. The packaging is also (personally) accessible (to me for my condition) - I have peripheral neuropathy which can make it difficult to use my hands some days, particularly opening / twisting motions and w/ precision, and I've never struggled with opening, holding, or controlling this particular product. I'm already on my 3rd re-purchase, and will continue repurchasing for as long as they make it.",

        "comments": "I no longer trust Fenty. The Amber shade changed, looks nothing like the photo anywhere it's sold, not even here! I've used the shade Amber since it was first released and they changed the formula but worse, the shade is completely different! \n\nIt used to be this beautiful cool toned taupe brown contour shade that blended out perfectly to a natural matte finish. This new formula is greasy and won't set no matter how I try. The worst part, the shade is TOTALLY DIFFERENT and looks so strange, so terrible. And before you ask, yes, I did check the labeling. \n\nIt now has this strange yellow cast that looks like a greasy yellowish jaundice like tan. Not at all appropriate as a contour, not even a bronzer. It looks nothing like the photo anymore. This new version is a greasy, almost transparent and barely pigmented. It barely shows up. It's like rubbing yellow grease on your neck and face. \n\nThinking I received a bad batch, I started reading other reviews. Looks like I am not alone. They changed the shade and failed to let us know and failed to update their images and description anywhere. This new version of \"Amber\" is not for cool undertones and definitely not cool toned as described. it's quite yellow. The old version was perfect for casting shadows in contouring. This new version is far less pigmented, very slick and greasy and doesn't blend and never sets.\n\nFrankly, I am shocked no one has taken to social media with this because it's such a dramatic difference. I'm sure this will eventually happen, but I would absolutely not trust this brand after this experience. Cool toned is listed in the description yet it's yellow. \n\nThe packaging has also changed. It is lighter weight plastic and lacks the original magnet that held these together. Honestly, I could care less about the packaging - it's the fact that I was lied to about the shade I spent my hard earned money on. It's not right to change a formula and a shade and not tell anyone. At least update the information so we can make an informed decision before making a purchase.",
