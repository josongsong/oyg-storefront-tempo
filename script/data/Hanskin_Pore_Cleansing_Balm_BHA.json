If it was \"pore cleansing\" this cleansing balm didn't do much for me. This is coming from someone with oily/combo skin. It was a bummer this product fell short and didn't improved my skin over all with the gentle BHA exfoliant. However I hope it is a 5-star hit with you!",

This oil cleanser is great because a little goes a long way when wearing minimal makeup and is a total pore cleanser oil cleanser. This saves my skin from the cystic breakouts by deeply cleansing, exfoliating without the dryness. I wouldnt recommend this product for people who have super sensitive skin because of the BHA,if they plan on using it for a daily oil cleanse but if maybe a weekly cleansing. Other than that I believe its sutible for all other skin types.",

My skin always feel smooth after use. It will sting your eyelash pores a bit though so I use coconut oil on the eyes to remove makeup first then use this product around my eyes to avoid the stinging sensation in eyelash pores.

So I know that it works, but I personally couldn't get used to the texture of the cleanser. It's the same texture as coconut oil, so it feels very greasy upon application. The absent fragrance also didn't help make the texture bearable, but after wiping the balm off, my face did feel really soft. It didn't feel like my face was stripped or bare, and it didn't feel dry like how most cleansers make my face feel. I'm giving this product 4 stars because it does work and it honestly makes my face feel really nice after. I just personally don't use makeup enough to make full use of this cleanser, and I couldn't get used to the texture. Overall it's solid!!",

I like the scent of it (reminds me of the spa) and the sustainable aspect to the product (don't need cotton pads/wipes). At first my face doesn't feel dried out after using it, but after some time it starts to get that skin-tight feeling. The balm does an okay job at removing my face makeup but does nothing to my mascara (KISS ME Heroine Make non-waterproof mascara, which is notorious for not getting removed easily). I still feel the need to double cleanse after, which I would be fine with if only the cleansing balm removed all of my stubborn makeup. I might try using it as my second step instead of the first step in double cleansing to see if it's better that way.",
