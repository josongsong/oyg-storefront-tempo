I completely ran out of powder recently and my local Ulta didn't have the Laura Mercier powder in stock in my shade. An employee recommended this Charlotte Tilbury pressed powder, said it was very blurring and didn't settle into fine wrinkles. I matched my shade, came home. I wore it for two days, and I kept catching glimpses of myself in the mirror at work, noticing exaggerated fine lines under my eyes and a cake-y texture. Did not care for that. The third time I wore it was the day I was planning to return it. I applied it a lot less heavy under my eyes that day, and while clothes shopping with my daughter kept noticing how smooth my complexion and pores looked in the dressing room mirror. I decided to keep using it a little longer, and realized that initially I was applying it heavy under my eyes like I did with the Laura Mercier powder. Once I backed off a little, everything balanced out. A dab will definitely do with this product. I'm still acclimating, but I think I really like it!",

There are better quality and cheaper options such as the too faced press powder (which has super cute packaging as well). The best aspect about this press powder is that it definitely helps blurr my conclear creases throughout the day.",
