The only thing this product has helped is maybe some redness and my skin looks a bit tighter.  This product is heavily scented which I believe caused me to break out.  I do not wake up glowy or even feel my skin deeply hydrated in the morning. Tried pairing this with hyaluronic acid to see if that would help but it made my skin burn by combining those two ingredients...",

        "comments": "Honestly, the main reason I bought this mini cream was the scent. I didn't even care if it did anything else. I figured it was good because of the price and I did see a lot of positive reviews. Some people say the scent was different before, but I cannot vouch for that as I am a first time buyer. It has a very light, natural peachy smell. I usually don't like fake peach smell, but this was just right. It is a rich, moisturizing cream and in the morning my skin feels rested and nourished. This is the last thing I put on at night and it sure feels like a treat. I highly recommend it.",

A little bit about me and my skin concerns: I'm 38, latina with tan skin, no wrinkles but a few fine lines around the corners of my lips. I struggle with eczema on my eyebrows, around my nose and chin. When I started using this cream, I had been dealing with a flare up that was into its 2nd week. 😫 I applied this the same night that I picked it up. Immediately, I noticed the lemony scent and silky feel on my skin. I had no stinging or burning. The next morning, MY FACE WAS CLEAR. No patches, no angry flare up. My skin was glowing and supple. It's been very hot in NJ and I've even used this twice a day with no adverse reaction. My skin looks so much better and that makes me happy. Thank you fresh for this amazing product. I love it. 🩷",

        "comments": "For starters, I noticed a slight fragrance to the cream upon taking the lid off.   I was always told face creams should never smell, and I used it anyway on my combination skin type.  My skin took a while to fade away all the red spots that formed after applying it to my skin.  Im not sure if it's related to the fragrance ingredient part but my skin did completely return to its normal color after almost 8 minutes of applying it. The texture of the cream is like a thick but whipped silk like moisturizer that easily spreads over my face and neck.   Although it's recommended to use morning and night, I have been only using this after my shower and before bed.  I wait a few minutes before laying my face onto the pillowcase to make sure my skin soaked up my cream. I can say this left my skin feeling soft the following morning where I didn't need to apply more after waking up. I didn't get any irritated feelings; just red spots around my face that vanished away.  I usually get pink on the apples of my cheek when I apply creams so this part of my honest feedback isn't to be alarming. The price tag makes sense for me because this cream isn't heavy to the touch but feels thick on the skin making it perfect for cold months.   I really like this cream for how much is in the package.  Key take away,  a little goes a long way so the package may appear small but there's a lot of product that goes a long way in here. Age slow and happy ❤️",

        "comments": "I received this product gifted by freshbeauty free in exchange for my honest review. First I should say I do have quite sensitive skin. Sometimes changes in my skincare routine can be irritating, but usually just adding one new thing isn't a problem. I also have acne prone skin but usually only breakout hormonally now. That being said, I seem to be one of the few who doesn't really like this product. I can't be 100% sure (because again, I sometimes breakout hormonal or my acne goes through strange phases) but I'm almost positive that this product severely irritated my skin. I think it's safe to assume that it was probably mostly the heavy fragrance in this product and likely some other ingredients that caused it. The first time I used it I didn't really notice a problem but the second time I noticed my cheeks immediately turned red and blotchy - I should have washed it off but didn't. My skin also just felt irritated and slightly itchy. Now I'm experiencing acne all over my cheeks and chin. Possibly some hormonal right now too, but this product definitely amplified the breakout. I don't plan on using it again so as to not risk any further irritation. I really would have hoped by now brands - especially EXPENSIVE skincare - would STOP putting fragrance in products.. please. It's not necessary and sensitive skin people like me can't use the product. Even if it's a more natural fragrance from the lotus and other ingredients which I assume it mostly is - it's strong and irritating to my skin. Again, it's likely other ingredients irritating my skin as well but I guess we'll never know for sure.",
