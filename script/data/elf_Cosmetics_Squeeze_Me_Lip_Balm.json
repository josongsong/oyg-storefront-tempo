I get migraines but the scent does not bother me. Lasts all night and doesn't burn. I get chilitis in the winter and can only use this and a few other brands. I have bought the vanilla multiple times and have bought it for friends who have loved it. Everyone who's tried it that I have recommended it to has LOVED it. Honestly I need to be paid by Elf at this point lol.",

The fragrance is yummy without being overwhelming and the mango reminds me of the mango fragrance by The Body Shop. They fit perfectly in your pocket and are about half the size of the Ole Hendriksen peptide balm tubes, which I find to be too large.\n\nThey have good slip and just feel nice on the lips, though my lips seem to absorb them quickly so I have to apply more often than I would like. The texture they most remind me of are the Laneige glowy balms and Mario Badescue tube balm. These e.l.f glosses are lighter than glosses like Lanolips, Glossier Balm Dotcom, and Summer Fridays.",

I don't think it's dupe worthy but I think it's a decent lip balm with a nice scent. Mine looks like it's about the size of a sample of foundation or bb cream, but the tube is only a little more than half filled. I like the squeeze tube, and the product comes out relatively easy. There is NO tint whatsoever in the peach shade, it looks like it would have one and it did claim a sheer tint but there was nothing on my lips or my arm (I tried to swatch it but it's just clear), so don't expect a tint from this. The product it's supposed to be \"duping\" has a couple different butters in it's formula but this one has only one and castor oil, with a few other basic ingredients. Is it a dupe? Not imo. Is it a good balm on a budget? Yea, and with a lip oil on top it feels pretty hydrating for the price, so it's a solid budget lip balm. I don't know that it will last long though since you would use a lot more product and the tube isn't filled completely so, keep that in mind.",
