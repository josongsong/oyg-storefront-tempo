        "comments": "When I first used this product I was not all that impressed. I felt I still needed another styler to help keep my curls from getting frizzy and add more definition. I kept experimenting with it and I'm glad I did. To style my hair I start with Bumble & Bumble Hairdresser's Invisible Oil Heat/UV Protective Hair Primer Leave-In Conditioner, then follow with a bit of this mousse and lastly, I layer on Ouidad Advanced Climate Control Heat & Humidity Gel in the white bottle. I will finger style my curls and let air dry overnight. In the morning I comb through my hair with my fingers, flip my hair upside down and LIGHTLY mist with water using a super fine spray bottle to reactivate the product. Then I dry for a few minutes on high heat, lowest air setting with a diffuser. Flip hair back over and finger comb again to separate curls a bit. I get amazing volume and super soft, bouncy curls. My hair is a layered shoulder length cut and using this mousse gives me that gorgeous \"soft focus\" 80's glam look. This is a holy trinity for my curls now. This mousse really is the key to longevity. I get 3 days of awesome curls, due to how this mousse seems to give the curls \"memory\" hold, if you know what I mean, without being stiff or tacky. I even go on 5k runs, during my week w/o washing and the next day my curls still look fab. The secret is to use less, too much of this mousse and it will feel gritty, almost as though this is a texturizing product.",

I kept experimenting with it and I'm glad I did. To style my hair I start with Bumble & Bumble Hairdresser's Invisible Oil Heat/UV Protective Hair Primer Leave-In Conditioner, then follow with a bit of this mousse and lastly, I layer on Ouidad Advanced Climate Control Heat & Humidity Gel in the white bottle. I will finger style my curls and let air dry overnight. In the morning I comb through my hair with my fingers, flip my hair upside down and LIGHTLY mist with water using a super fine spray bottle to reactivate the product. Then I dry for a few minutes on high heat, lowest air setting with a diffuser. Flip hair back over and finger comb again to separate curls a bit. I get amazing volume and super soft, bouncy curls. My hair is a layered shoulder length cut and using this mousse gives me that gorgeous \"soft focus\" 80's glam look. This is a holy trinity for my curls now. This mousse really is the key to longevity. I get 3 days of awesome curls, due to how this mousse seems to give the curls \"memory\" hold, if you know what I mean, without being stiff or tacky. I even go on 5k runs, during my week w/o washing and the next day my curls still look fab. The secret is to use less, too much of this mousse and it will feel gritty, almost as though this is a texturizing product.",

It felt fuller, looked fuller and yet my hair didn't have that \"tacky\" feeling.  It was very very natural.  My hair felt great and looked great.  I had FINALLY found the perfect mousse after many trial and errors.  Then I purchased several cans to have on hand......not noticing the \"tricky\" added word of SOFT to the product name until after using it several times and wondering if I had received a \"defective\" product.  I AM SO DISAPPOINTED.  The new version makes my fine hair soft …...way too soft.  I assume most people that have baby fine hair like mine already have hair that is too soft. The last thing I need is to make it softer!!!  It just lays flat on my skull.....like baby hair!! I think it was false advertising to change one word on the can....and totally change the product.  PLEASE PLEASE BRING BACK ORIGINAL FORMULA",
