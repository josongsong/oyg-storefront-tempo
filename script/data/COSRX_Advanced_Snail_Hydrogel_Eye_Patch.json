It would have been very simple for them to cut the sizes in half when they were creating them.\n\nI have sensitive skin, and it doesn't mind the eye patches.",

I am sure glad that I gave in and gave it a try! The size of the product is much more generous than I was originally expecting. I actually didn't know what to expect at first, so let me explain. I received a jar of \"patches\" that could be used anywhere on my face, but the idea is that they should be particularly focused on my eye area. You not only get eye patches, but where the eye patches are 'cut' out, you also get the additional part of the \"patch\", I guess what could be considered waste. But instead of just tossing it, they package it in the product jar and encourage you to place the smaller patches on your smile lines or any other areas that need hydration. It's such a great idea and honestly really effective! For someone who is a school teacher, runs around with very little time for themselves, the 20-30 mins I used to apply these to my face and continue to do other tasks was WELL WORTH IT!",
