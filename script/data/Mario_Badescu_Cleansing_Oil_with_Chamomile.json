I use this as a pre-cleanse to help remove the top layer of my daily grime/oil before using my cleanser. \n\nI leave this cleansing oil on for 3-5 minutes to let it really work and rinse with lukewarm water. I follow with my preferred cleanser and a generous spritz of the Mario Badescu Facial Spray with Aloe, Adaptogens, and Coconut Water.\n\nI think a lot of individuals expect things to work immediately. Yet it takes time for skin to adjust to products, depending. Everyone's skin is different and the same product is not going to work for everyone. It isn't necessarily a \"bad product\" if it doesn't work for you. You can have sensitivities to certain ingredients when others don't. It's trial and error when it comes to skincare. Your best bet is to seek a dermatologist if many products aren't working in your favor. \n\nP.S. Makeup wipes are the worst. Don't do it.",

        "comments": "I got a travel size version of this for free with a purchase, and it has that lever/spout type top… which I hate because the oil gets all over the place no matter how careful you are. The way this smells is just so bizarre to me. I don't notice it too much if I just remove eye makeup, but if I remove anything by my nose or mouth it makes me want to gag. It's a lavender essential oil meets vinegar type smell to me. I also don't like that I have to use twice as many cotton rounds to remove my makeup with this stuff because it tends to smear the makeup around while it picks it up. The oil also stays on top of your skin, so even if you removed your makeup with anything else prior to using this, you'll still have to completely wash your face after this. Compared to the Lancôme Bi-Facial remover, this one is a flop for me. I will say though, a little does go a long way with this oil.",
