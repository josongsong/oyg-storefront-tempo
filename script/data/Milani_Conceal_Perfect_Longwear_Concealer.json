I decided to let it sit there to get more coverage and i would not blend at all! It dries down VERY quickly. After a couples days, i then noticed huge cystic acne forming right where i put it. I took a break from the concealer and it slowly went away. SO! IF YOU HAVE ACNE PRONE SKIN, NEED FULL COVERAGE, OR A EXACT SHADE MATCH, THIS CONCEALER IS NOT FOR YOU!!",

I applied with the applicator wand that comes with the tube and a beauty blender type sponge a foundation flat brush and setting spray. The formula is on the thick side and needs a little work to blend over your face. I sugest working quickly to blend and if it gets a little tough to apply spray your beauty blender with setting spray to thin out. It took me about 10 mins to apply and I was very satisfied with the results below in my photos are my areas of concern and how well it greatly minimized the appearance of the blemishes its a 9/10 for me",

I was sent shade 135 medium beige. The concealer consistency was good as well. It wasn't too thick or too runny. But the coverage didn't seem to meet my needs. I will admit that I applied it to a bare non-primed face for this wear test. I found that it applied evenly and did blend out well. But within an hour i noticed it began to settle into the creases under my eyes. As time went on I noticed it started to cake a bit. This being my first impressions of the product I wasn't fully impressed. However, I will use it again to see if i have the same outcome. For the price point, it's about average but I was hoping for better coverage and wear time. I also noticed that depending on the lighting i was in I could see my dark circles more. I also noticed that as i patted under my eye just now most of the concealer came off on my fingertip. But once again I will give this product another try.",
