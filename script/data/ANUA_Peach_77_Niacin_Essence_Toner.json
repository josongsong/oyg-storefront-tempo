        "comments": "I didnt know what i was missing in my routine until i gave this a try! Immediately i could tell my serums and moisturizers were absorbing more effectively and to boot, the pesky black heads in the dry creases of my nose have finally disappeared. My pores are clearly tightened and skin is smoother, which has been a struggle. It smells like peaches and you cannot beat the price. I bought this instead of the GoodMolecules niaciamide toner because one, I wasnt fully convinced of it's benefits actually working for me and two, you get more product for a cheaper price per ounce. I'll probably never replace this toner in my skincare and will be so happy if it starts being sold in store.",

        "comments": "I tried many toners throughout my life but none of them worked as well as this peach toner. At first I was a bit skeptical as many of the Anua products dont work on me but somehow this was the only product in their line that managed to help lighten and clear out my dark spots and help soothe redness. It has a light fragrance but it goes away once you apply it. I personally like applying it with a cotton pad but you can also use your hands if thats what you like.",

        "comments": "I'm new using this product, but so far I'm liking it from the very first use, it's been a whole different experience from other toners I've used in the past. It's very liquid (kind of the laneige), but you can pour it in your hands and even work it out between your hands and it won't spill, it applies very \"silky\", it has a slight peach scent that doesn't linger in your skin, it gets absorbed completely without feeling sticky and I like the easy my skin looks and feels. I'm happy because at least I notice this qualities compared to other toners I've used that didn't give me anything wow, with this one I can see something that I like, I just began using it like 3 days ago so I can't comment on the long term benefits but I'm very satisfied.",
