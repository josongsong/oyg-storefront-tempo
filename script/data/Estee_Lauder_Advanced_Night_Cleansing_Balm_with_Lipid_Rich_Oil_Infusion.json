        "comments": "My skin is a bit on the sensitive side and regular makeup remover wipes gave me tiny bumps in the eye area. This product was recommended by an Estée Lauder consultant that was at Ulta while I was there.  I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and I love it.  Takes off all my foundation (EL Double Wear) with ease, and all other makeup as well.  I put it on like a cream then splash warm water on it and continue to rub my face, it looks like milk.  I then use a wet, soft makeup removal cloth to completely remove it.  I follow it up with my Clinique Clarifying Lotion #3 to remove any residue.  It makes my skin feel so soft! And no breakouts of any kind!  It is pricey, so I will use rewards points or sales to repurchase, but it only takes a small amount so it should last for months.",

I was so very wrong!  I love it.  It immediately calms me down as I apply it. It even removes most of my mascara. Then I have a Clarisonic brush (Mia) that I dampen under running warm water and use all over my face. It transforms into a wonderful cleansing foam.  It cleans every pore.  Can't live without that brush either.  Apply, an astringent and then a good serum or moisturizer.   Anyway, this is a wonderful product that I hope doesn't get discontinued.  Love it!",
