        "comments": "I got this after my amika one stopped turning on after only 3 months of weekly use. Told myself i would never spend a lot of money on a luxary hot tool again. This one turned out to be BETTER than the amika. It does not tug on my hair or get caught in the bristles (fine thin hair for reference). There is no weird smell and it doesnt get too hot even on the highest heat setting so my hair isnt frying off. Its lasted longer than the amika and its still going strong. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a reliable hair brush dryer that doesnt break the bank.",

It usually takes me hours to blowdry all of my thick curls but I genuinely was able to completely straighten my curls in about 20 minutes with this product. I did go in with a flat iron at my roots but this blow dryer brush really gives you that salon blow out look! I like that I can get results fast without using heat on my hair for hours!! Curly girls, give this a try!",

Not even 2 minutes after turning it on it made a loud sound and completely stopped working with a weird smell.  I'll be returning it to my local Ulta and hopefully they can order me another one.  I want to give it another chance.",
