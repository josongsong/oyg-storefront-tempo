The cream is light, applies easily and has minimal fragrance. It can be a little sticky if you use too much, but overall it's a good product. \n\nI think the price is a little high, though.",

And I have deep wrinkles on my neck that have been there for at least 20+ years I never expected to see lighten or smooth out from any product. Especially not after only a week. The poised cream has helped with my little double chin as well (which has also just been there and my face shape my whole life and I'm a very active and healthy person. So it's been quite stubborn). I also have the worst dark circles in all of the land, let me tell you. Slathering on the bright cream at night has helped so much too. And the thic cream is helping lift and and slightly plump my nice little round booty, so thank you!! These products are the absolute best! Would highly recommend and have already raved about them to my mom and friends. These products actually do exactly what they say, and that is incredibly hard to find (I've tried just about every product under the sun, a bit of an obsession).",

But I assure you, none of my friends are asking \"Did you have work done!?\"  And no, my husband isn't noticing anything either. That's because this does not firm anything. At all.  While the smell is lovely and it does a decent job of moisturizing, it does not work as advertised.  I would maybe buy it again because who doesn't like to be moisturized.  But if you are thinking this will save you from an impending neck lift, then No.  No it will not.",
