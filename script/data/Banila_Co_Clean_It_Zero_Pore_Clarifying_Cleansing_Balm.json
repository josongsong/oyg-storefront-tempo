The texture feels like creamy at first, then melts into an oil that takes off all my makeup and sunscreen even the stubborn waterproof stuff. After rinsing, my skin feels really clean but still soft and hydrated, not stripped of natural oils like I've felt with other products. I like that it has Vitamin E and other nourishing ingredients, and the jar lasts a long time so it's a good value! The scent is sweet and smells good so it doesn't bother me. I always follow up with a gentle cleanser, and this has definitely earned a permanent spot in my routine.",

Once you add water, it emulsifies instantly and rinses off with very little effort. \n\nAfter cleansing, i feel clean and soft, not stripped in the slightest. And after a few weeks I definitely see a difference in my pores and acne. \n\nI loved this enough that I went out and bought a backup if the larger size so i have one ready to go when my current jar runs out",

        "comments": "I have never tried a cleansing balm like the Banila line. There are four different types of balms in the line, and currently are formulated to suit different skin concerns. I used each for 3 days. \n\nThe first one, Clean It Zero Original (pink bottle), is an unscented balm that applies easily. It removed my makeup and left my face feeling refreshed and \"minty\". No complaints and would use this one again! \n\nThe second one I tried, Clean It Zero Purifying (blue bottle), in my opinion is suited for more sensitive skin that is also acne prone. True to its' name, it left my face purified and refreshed. It wasn't harsh, but still felt like it deep cleaned my skin. It did not irritate me or cause any adverse reaction. No complains and would use this one again, too! \n\nThe Clean It Zero Nourishing (yellow bottle) in my opinion is suited best for dry skin that requires a little extra moisture, although it would probably work on any type! It felt very \"light\" compared to the others and had a more subtle affect. Again, no complaints on this one either! I would definitely try it again. \n\nThe Clean It Zero Revitalizing (green bottle) was different in that it has a soft smell that is not too overpowering (for me anyways). It is the only one out of the four that had a noticeable scent, and was the only one that felt a little \"waxy\" after the application. Not a showstopper, as it easily was removed, but it definitely felt like a different texture compared to the rest. I would still use it again, but only if I had no other makeup removed.\n\nTo conclude my review, I enjoyed trying each product in this line and figure out what works best for me. I would honestly like to incorporate these products into my routine after quarantine (not wearing as much makeup, haha) as a makeup remover. Each different formula removed my stubborn eyeshadows, mascaras, etc. without any irritation or spreading. These would also be great for a beginner who needs a good pre-cleanser or makeup remover!",

        "comments": "I have pale, dry, super sensitive skin, and easily prone to breakouts. I wear a moderate amount of makeup; it's mostly eye makeup (eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara), tinted moisturizer, and lipstick. I normally use micellar water and Target cotton rounds to remove my makeup. However, this method was leaving my skin red, irritated, and the skin under my eyes was raw/hurt. And, I was always struggled with stubborn eyeliner stuck on my waterline, so I wakeup the next day with breakouts and like a raccoon. \n\nI was super excited to try this product out because I saw a lot of people recommending it. PROS: Effectively removed my makeup with a reusable makeup eraser, didn't cause irritation, and my eyes were NOT raw afterwards. So, it was easier to put makeup/skincare on the following day. Also, no more stubborn eyeliner on my waterline and lower lashes. Yay for less white and black heads! \n\nCONS: To fully remove eye makeup, you have to rub it over your eye lashes. This caused my eyes to become milky, blurry, and irritated. I thought I needed to go back to the eye doctor and get a stronger prescription because it was like a fish tank. I'm not a makeup artist; I'm 30-years-old, but need instructions like a toddler. I need specifics and the directions can be kinda misleading. The box says, \"apply balm on dry face and gently massage in circular motion to melt away makeup.\" So, using my finger, I took a small ball/clump of product (size of very small grape) and put it directly on my face/eyes. I quickly learned this was a mistake as my eyes burned and used  a wash cloth to see again. The effects didn't last long, barely 10 minutes. Next, time I used this product I used a fingernail ball/clump and flatten + massaged the product into my fingertips BEFORE putting it on my eyes/face. This made a vast improvement because it effectively removed my makeup without causing irritation. I really wish there was a warning on the label/container about the possibility of blurriness. \n\nOverall, I'm happy with this product because it gets the job done with stubborn makeup. Is this my go-to makeup remover? No! Because I'm not a fan of the blurriness afterwards. But, it's not like I have a life, so I just deal with it and go to bed afterwards. Dealing with blurry vision is better than longterm white heads and black heads, which can be more annoying to remove. I don't know the long-term effects of this product either. I've been using this product 2-3 times a week for over a month and haven't experienced any damage to my eyes.",
