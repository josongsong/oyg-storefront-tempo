I don't use a million products but the ones i do use are nice products. Im not sure what it is about this moisturizer but it does not soak into my skin. I don't use a ton underneath it either. But it sits on top and doesn't soak in, even with only using a teeny amount. The texture is nice out of the jar and its not overly scented which i like. I just wish it absorbed and I didn't feel like i have a film ln my face when i use it. I, unfortunately, will be returning.",

I accidentally discovered this moisturizer while looking for a new one to replace my cerave, and I ordered it. I immediately fell in love! It's long lasting, gives me dewy skin, VERY long hydration and wears amazing under makeup. A little goes a long way, and putting too much will probably make your makeup pill. I use this day and night or when I wash my face. I highly will recommend this for dry skin, I've gotten many of my friends to use this and they love it!",

I've tried them all: Eminence, Peach and Lily, Tatcha, Avené, Vanicream, The Ordinary, CeraVe, Neutrogena, Orgins, PTR, stuff from the spas I worked at (I'm a licensed Aesthetician) plus more and nothing has been my favorite. \n\nI wouldn't see great results or they'd break me out either in fungal acne or white heads, my skin would feel greasy or be flakey. I have sensitive, combo skin thats very acne prone and rosacea to top it all off. I finally broke down and asked an Ulta worker for their opinion and they brought me to this. I was hesitant but bought it anyways. \n\nMy skin has seriously never looked better!! Fine lines? Gone. Redness? Where?? Breakouts?? Haven't heard of her. I cannot talk about this enough! If you're stuggling like I was, PLEASE buy this asap. I can't get over the fact it's $25- you get so much and just a little bit goes a long ways. I'm obsessed. I would never write such a long review but the people need to know!",

Its cooling on the skin and keeps it moisturized, my face always looks plump and smooth the next day. I've been struggling with clogged pores from my heavier winter skincare products but this doesn't irritate me. I've been trying out CosRX products and this is my favorite so far. I use it in combination with the Hydrium Watery Toner, together they're a great team for dry winter skin. I can tell Ill be using this cream all year long to keep my skin balanced. 10/10",

        "comments": "I have acne-prone, dehydrated skin. I had very high hopes for this considering COSrx always uses \"clean\" and simple ingredients. However, just like CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion, this broke me out. I believe it's the fatty alcohols, which some people are sensitive to. However if you're not as acne-prone this might be a good option for you.\nThe texture is gel-cream like, but relatively thick and emollient. I personally found this to stay pretty sticky, and it always felt like my face was sticking to my pillow at night. \nI think if your skin is super super dry, this will be nice. However my skin is too easily-congested for a cream like this.",
