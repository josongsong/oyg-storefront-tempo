It's has a heat protectant for you hair so while blow dryer or other hair styling tools you will not fry your hair and because you not frying you hair, it won't fall out all over the house or in the shower or in you hair brush. I started noticing in the shower I wasn't loosing nearly as much hair as before. The smell of this hair product Is divine. NOT over powering and very subtle. It just smell beautiful. You have to really go looking for the smell to notice it. My favorite part of this product is it WEIGHTLESS !!!!! You can go crazy spraying this all over your wet hair and it will not weight down your hair. It's amazing I can't stop using it. You can spray your roots, mid section, and crown / top of you hair and go crazy but, you will not feel this product in you hair when your done blow drying and stying your hair.I recommend this product. You won't regret it.",

I don't find it makes my hair crunchy like my shea moisture products do sometimes (if i over do it) and they're not protectants. It does a better job at detangling than my sheas do, BUT could be better. I wasn't a fan of the smell, but my bf liked it. That's saying something. I did get used to it and the smell stayed in my hair which hear protectants NEVER do! So if you like the smell I'd say it's a win for you. Price i would say is ok... there are other expensive ones but they are creams which may be heavy or smell may not last. I would buy if i liked the smell! I love that it's basically perfume for your hair with heat protectant and detangler, this is where my review is mostly coming from. I was gifted this complementary. I see that bumble and bumble protects from UV so... kinda would want that too.",
