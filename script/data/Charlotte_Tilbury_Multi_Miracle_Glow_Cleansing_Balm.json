        "comments": "I'm about to buy my third jar of this — it's THAT good!\n\nThis is a gorgeous cleansing balm, perfect for removing light to medium makeup and leaving my skin feeling soft and nourished. If you wear heavy or long-wear makeup, you might need a double cleanse or a separate eye makeup remover, since this balm isn't meant to go into the eyes.\n\nI have very dry skin, and this cleanser is just perfect. My favorite way to use it is to rub it all over my face, hop in the shower, let the steam soften everything, then dampen my fingers and massage it in before rinsing off. My skin always feels clean, comfortable, and never stripped.\n\nI've also tried it as a mask, but personally didn't love it in that role — it shines as a cleanser.\n\nHighly recommend if you're looking for a gentle, luxurious balm for everyday use!",
