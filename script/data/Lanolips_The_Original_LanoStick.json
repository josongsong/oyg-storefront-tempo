My only issue with it is something another reviewer also shared, which is that there isn't a whole lot of product in the tube, so with regular daily use, you'll go through this in 3 or 4 weeks. I've had mine for a week and a half, and I'm already one third of the way done with it.",

The lemon balm like scent is pretty good to me also. My only complaint is that the stick packaging leaves so much product unused in my opinion. Once you've used the product the barrel, there's still at least a gram of product left to be used. I don't want to apply it by hand or by brush, it's just inconvenient and/or unsanitary to me depending on the circumstance. If I was someone that was big into depotting my products, it probably would be fine but I'm not.",

I agree with the other reviews that say it's very easy to use the product quickly, I wish there was a way for there to be more product in the tube, because its pricey for the size. but the convenience and quality is worth it to me. at least in winter time",

As the description says, it's unscented, unflavored and non-tinted. I do think it's a tad expensive, but I like it so far.",

        "comments": "This is by far, the best lip balm I've ever tried. I love the lemon smell, it glides on so smoothly, the subtle sheen is so adorable. It's so moisturizing, I use the 101 ointment as well, but I like how this one doesn't leave a white cast if I want to lather one more often. The only thing that grinds my gears is that it dwindles very fast. It's very emulsifying so it's easy to get carried away cause it melts like butter. If you are going to use this everyday, this will last 2-3 weeks tops because it's not a long tube of product to begin with, makes me sad because this isn't cheap! However, I can't go back.",

        "comments": "I have been searching for a replacement balm ever since my holy grail lip balm was absolutely ruined by reformulation. I was hoping the lanolin and beeswax combination in this would work. Unfortunately, I am still looking after trying this product. I was immediately turned off by the smell when I opened the tube, so much so that I almost didn't even put it on. It is a little bit less offensive when it's actually on my lips, but I still catch the odd whiff of lemon, and it just makes me want to scrub this off. It adds more shine to my lips as well, and makes them more slippery than I like, more so than the Lanolips ointment, probably because this has added oils. Seems to work slightly better than your average lip balm, though still not nearly as well as my former fave. The stick formulation is a plus, especially these days, when even touching clean fingers to my lips makes me twitchy. But even a good product isn't going to work if I hate to use it. I'll keep this for emergencies, if only because it's too much hassle to return it. If you love lemon scented things, this would still be worth a try for you, but I won't be purchasing this again.",
