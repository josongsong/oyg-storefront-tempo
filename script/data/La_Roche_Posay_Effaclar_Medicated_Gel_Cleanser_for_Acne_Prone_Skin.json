I kept the bottle, because of how much I paid for it, but I keep it in a solo cup. I am satisfied with the actual product, though. I purchased this as an alternative to the Skinceuticals LHA/SA cleanser, as that one  made my skin shine like a buffed floor, but not oily, which kind of scared me. This cleanser leaves my skin with that squeaky clean feeling, without the buffed shiny look. Like the Skinceuticals cleanser, it does have that menthol cooling effect, which can be nice, but irritating, as Im using a retinoid at night. Overall, Im happy with the actual product, packaging needs to be better, and an option without the menthol would be great! Thank you for coming to my TED Talk, hehe",

The product itself is good, I use it when I'm having a PD flare up, but the fact that it doesn't seal is really frustrating.",

Tried everything on drugstores and nothing worked. went to see a derm and got some prescription and didn't really work either. My co-worker told me about thi brand and decided to buy the acne kit. This fixed my skin soooooo quick is unreal. This is my second bottle  and I couldn't be happier... control my oily skin and cleans it super good. I have been on these products for 3 months and my skin is soft, my pores/skin looks better and have not had a breakout, just when it;s that time of the month... I will continue to use this brand forever!!!",
