A little goes a long way and out of the 100+ clients including myself, it has worked wonders. After the first application of this you'll notice a difference right away, it doesn't leave any type of residue after drying it melts into your skin and isnt oily. I have a oily T zone & this does not add to it. It made my skin feel so soft and hydrated throughout the entire day as well as night. Highly recommend 1000x over.",

        "comments": "Love the consistency of this but, like with most lancome products, its heavily scented and it does not entirely dissipate. The consistency is lovely. I only use a little bit, and it absorbs pretty quickly. My skin looks hydrated and glowy.  Its perfect under sunscreen, helps even application and prevent dryness and cakiness. I find this to be very similar to Clinique's moisture surge 100h hydrator. Clinique's is less expensive and unscented. I continue to buy both, since they offer the ideal level of hydration I need without feeling sticky or getting cakey.",

All that said I don't think I'll be repurchasing after I finish this jar because of the OLD LADY SMELL!!!! I just can't deal lol.
