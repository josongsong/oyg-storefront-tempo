        "comments": "I can't remember if I've ever written a comment for this lip balm, but if I did it was probably about 6 years ago when I first started using it. I literally have not bought any other kind of lip balm since then, nor have I been tempted to! I haven't even tried the solid twist-up version of this lip balm because I know the squeeze tube version works perfectly. I still remember how after the first application of this I said \"Woah!\" because it just felt so great, and it continued to be. This stuff stays on really well, even after eating or drinking, brushing my teeth, washing my face, or sleeping. Its consistency is thick but not goopy or sticky. I almost always get the mint just because it's classic and kind of neutral in flavor, but I love the smell and taste of rose so occasionally I will buy one of those. I've come to accept the price of this product because of how well it works for me, and I just hope this lip balm will still be made for many years to come!",

I used for a week, for science to make sure it was the product making my lips dry and not just situation, sure enough every time it wore off my lips were worse and worse. This is one of those lip products that makes you reliant on continuous use and must continuously reapply to have soft lips because the second it wears off your lips are dry. Bad product, genius concept for seller....making you reliant on a product that does the opposite.",

        "comments": "I've tried so many lip balms in my life and this is the one! I love the Mario Badescu rosewater facial spray so I thought I'd try the lip balm from this brand.  I love the texture of it- its not like a traditional waxy or gloopy/sticky chapstick. Most lip balms make my mouth really dry from accidentally getting the waxy texture in my mouth... this is the first lip balm I've tried that doesn't do that. Its a thin almost oily balm that sinks into the lips almost right away so its not sticky or gross feeling. I like the applicator (its like those kinds of lip glosses we all used as a kid) but it takes some getting used to because its easy to squeeze out too much- you only need a tiny bit. It doesn't smell strong, its like a light coconut scent and it doesn't taste like anything which I prefer. It instantly soothes my dry, chapped lips and I've been taking it everywhere with me this winter. It lasts for hours too so I'm not constantly reapplying. I actually thought I had lost my tube but I just found it in the dryer when I was taking my clothes out. And the best part... the tube survived the washer and the dryer! Its perfectly fine! That's what made me go right away and type up this review lol. This might be the first tube of lip balm that I've ever finished in my life. I usually either lose them or buy a new one in the hopes that I'll find one I like better. My search is over- this is the one!",

        "comments": "I grabbed this up because it claims that it is peppermint, and I am always looking for the next best balm. This product does moisturize well, but I recommend that you put it on before sleep. It doesn't fare well in the day, as it is super greasy and will travel far and wide, which can look a bit funny and also clog pores around your lips. A little goes a long way, and you will wake up with lips that don't feel dry. (I like to gently exfoliate my lips in the evening with a damp toothbrush or washcloth, and then apply my lip product before sleep.) The peppermint flavor was hardly noticeable and there was a strange aftertaste, reminiscent of good ole vegetable oil. The formula is very slippery and will run all over. There is a lot in the tube, and you only need a bit, but I feel like there are so many better options out there that I wouldn't purchase this again. I love many Bedescu products, but I'll stick with Carmex, Burt's Bee's peppermint, L'Occitane shea balm, or Rituals Miracle Rescue when it comes to lip care.",
