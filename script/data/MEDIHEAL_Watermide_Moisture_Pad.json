        "comments": "I did just buy this product in january and use it about 3 times a week or more if my skin is extra dey. Currently ive been going through the \"Retinol uglies\" and this (along with a couple other products) has been helping my dry skin! I like that the packaging comes with tweezers and that the pads are very soft on your skin. I usually put on one my forehead in a diamond shape and then i use clean scissors to cut another pad vertically for under my eyes. I leave them on till they fully absorb. It makes my skin care routine feel fancier than it really is!\n\nThe one con i have so far is im unsure where to buy the refills? I bought this in store thinking this was a cool concept for sustainability (although theres room for improvement) but i cannot locate the refills anywhere? Maybe its just me who cant find them but i probably would not buy it again in this packaging.",

        "comments": "Let me start off by saying that I usually use La Mer products in winter - the Treatment Lotion and The Hydrating Revitalizing Serum followed by a moisturizer.  I picked up this packet of Mediheal pads mostly because they came in such a cute box that matches my bathroom decor, but also because they are moisturizing.  Today I tried them instead of my two La Mer products, and my skin feels the same as it does with the La Mer.  So this is quite the economical alternative.  I just used this as a toner pad because I can't be bothered to sit around with pads on my cheeks for 15 minutes.  The one problem I had is that these sheets are really, REALLY thin and flimsy, and it kept balling up under my fingers as I tried to wipe my face with the pad.  Also, without my glasses it was impossible to use the tweezers to pick out one single pad, so I just scrabbled around in the box with my fingers to get one.  This seems like a good product to replace my expensive stuff, when it runs out, and in the meantime I'll just keep practicing with them.",

Cant speak to the long term use as I just received them. But i did want to add this warning to others- the lid was still sealed so I know they werent tampered with but the pads were everywhere in the container. I pulled one out and a bunch came with it because even though it looked like it was on the top, it was actually partially under half the other pads. Im not sure if it was due to poor packaging or how they shifted during transit but I basically had to use the tweezers provided to realign the entire package.",
