        "comments": "As someone with very fair skin, its diffult for me to find a bronzer that doesn't end up looking muddy or pulling orange on my skin. The shade \"Hey Honey\" is the perfect neutral cream bronzer for me. It has buildable coverage that works for both my minimal makeup and full glam days. It has a pretty good wear time, I've worn it for 8+ hours with miminal fading. It doesn't cling to dry spots and doesn't look patchy like other cream brozners I've used. Would definitely recommend this to anyone searching for an affordable cream bronzer",
