Most skincare products need a build up to see results...not this stuff.  First time I used it....amazing!!!!

I typically use lemon Witch Hazel every morning to wake up my skin and I love that delcious lemon scent - it wakes me right up. But my bottle of witch hazel was low and I wanted to try this Aloe Toner. I have used every day for a week and it's wondeful! Not at all drying like many toner seem to be. This one doesn't have much scent if any, which is fine with me, and it makes my skin feel great first thing in the morning. I will continue to use it!",

This was suggested by an employee who I informed of my skin troubles. This product slowly but surely ruined my skin. Thinking it's the methylparaben and coloring. Used for two months not realizing my acne was from this and not stress/hormones. HUGE MISTAKE. I broke out in places I've never had acne before. I have to deal with terrible scarring now. If you're a no wearing makeup kind of person like me, you know how terribly this has affected me, I've spent many days and nights in avoiding going out in public and honestly have cried over how messed up this made my skin.  Sensitive skin individuals - STAY AWAY!  Don't let the \"aloe\" fool you.",
