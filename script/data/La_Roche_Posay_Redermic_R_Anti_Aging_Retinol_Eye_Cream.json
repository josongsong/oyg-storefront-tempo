I have hereditary dark circles from my middle eastern background & was starting to notice more wrinkle under my eyes. I was not expecting this to work that well I'll be honest! For my dark circles & fine lines this product has to be the best I've used!! For the first month or 2 I  was using it on & off because I was scared to use it every night. Then consistently started to use it & noticed pretty dramatic results. My under eyes have never looked so bright & my fine lines are very faint now. \n\nStay consistent!! This product is gold✨✨",

I'm the type of person when I'm trying anything I'm very consistent and follow the instructions as told so it's wasn't like I used it here and there and didn't follow what it has said. IV tried many products since I just turned 40 and what to find a good product not to stop aging or be a miracle lol but something that helps with female skin once you hit your 40s ya know?! This is definitely not a product I will use again and did nothing for me! I get everyone is different but come on something that is one of the \"higher\" amounts of retinol in it and it to do nothing? I don't buy it or it's not very good retinol in this product. That's how I look at it but that's what happened when I used this product!",

The 0.1% retinol strength is higher than I've seen in other retinol eye creams, but so far I haven't experienced any irritation, probably thanks to most (all?) of the retinol being encapsulated. I've been using this a couple of weeks now as a preventive measure for anti-aging, so it's not possible for me to say yet whether it really works for slowing down the development of wrinkles, but I figure that with the reasonably high amount of retinol in the formula, this is probably one of the most promising products out there. Since it hasn't caused irritation, I will continue to use it comfortably.",

Also it instantly perks up my tired eyes making them feel wide awake (I believe, because of the caffeine ingredient?). At 40 years old I have spent over a decade trying dozens of various eye creams to find one that tightens the eye area, treats wrinkles, and cools/gives eyes an instant lift and wide awake feel. This is hands down the \"only\" all around winner. And I have tried so many; most costing in the $90 to $150 range. I love this cream so much I find myself re-applying multiplying it times a day. I've become addicted to the cooling/wake awake feel it gives my eyes, along with a tightening/smoothing effect (my concealer goes on beautifully after I've applied this cream and let it dry for about 1 minute). Another perk for me: the price. So unless this formula discontinues or changes, I will remain a devoted fan.  I've purchased myself backups already (6 to be exact!).",
