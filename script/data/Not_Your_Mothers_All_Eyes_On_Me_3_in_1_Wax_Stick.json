It glides on effortlessly, taming flyaways and giving my hair a smooth, defined look without any sticky or greasy residue. I love that it hydrates while styling, thanks to its blend of nourishing ingredients like Argan Oil and Raspberry Oil. It's also long-lasting, keeping my style in place all day without any flaking. The added benefit of UV protection is a great touch, especially for someone like me who's out in the sun often. Plus, it's gentle enough for all hair types, and I appreciate the clean, conscious formula that aligns with my values. A must-have for anyone looking for an easy, effective way to style their hair!",

I didn't apply the product from the stick directly on my hair, I warmed some up on my fingers and patted it down on dry hair. This product is thick and sticky, and it made my hair look greasy. The product claims to \"add shine\" and I suppose it does, but to me it looked more like oily hair. I'd rather use hairspray for my flyaways. The product does add texture though, so it would be good for braids as suggested. It also smells good, I assume from the raspberry oil. If I don't give this to one of my friends who I knows likes the slicked back look, I could see myself trying this out at the beach or pool to protect my hair since it claims to have UV protection. Overall, I don't think I was the right person for this product since my hair is already fine and can get oily quickly, and I don't slick my hair back. If you do and also have maybe thicker or coarser hair, I think you could like it.",
