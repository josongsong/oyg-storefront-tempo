It's moisturizing, smoothing, and sinks into the skin quickly while still leaving a nice, small bit of glow.\n\nAs for the \"targeting aging\" aspect of this eye cream, I don't really think it's there. Keeping the eye area moisturized will obviously contribute to keeping the eye area looking youthful, but I wouldn't trust this for major prevention.\n\n If you're in your early to mid twenties, like me, this is a good starter for prevention, but I'd suggest shopping around for stronger prevention as you move into your late twenties.  \n\nIf you have deeper lines, bags or wrinkles, you should only expect to gain moisturization from this product.",

        "comments": "I was really excited to try this I cream, especially after seeing so many glowing reviews. I was really hoping to have found an economically-priced hidden gem. However, this cream did not address my eye area concerns. I don't really have dark circles, puffs, or bags. I am 36 and have oily skin. I was really looking for moderate hydration with an emphasis on the fine lines around my eyes. I will admit that this cream is extremely hydrating, and perhaps softened the look of the lines a tiny bit due to that hydration. But that was only when I was not wearing make up. I found that the screen was too heavy for me to wear underneath I make up, and that anything that I put around my eyes would inevitably settle into the creases under them. To be clear, I wear waterproof mascara, waterproof eyeliner, and really good eyeshadow primer. I set everything with setting powder. However, within a few hours, I would have substantial black blobs under my eyes whenever I wore this eye cream under my eye make up. This may work really well for other people, but it just wasn't for me.",
