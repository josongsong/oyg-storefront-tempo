I'm 64 and would describe my hair as being neutral, meaning it isn't dry or oily. This product has actually replaced the hairsprays I used to use which I was never quite satisfied with. I'm also thrilled that I'm able to buy this in my local Ulta store. So happy they carry the Innersense line.",

It is SO thick and heavy so I was like great, this will hold well. What it actually does is clump your curls in a really weird and unnatural way, dry them out completely, leave tons of frizz, and make you feel like you have to clarify every time you use it. WOOF. Also made my scalp really itchy after only three uses. Switching back to Ouidad, thanks!",

The cast is firm, but breaks pretty easily with oil scrunching. Leaves my hair super defined, shiny, and soft/touchable. Also, it holds up even in humidity/ rain for me! \n\nThere's a bit of a learning curve with this gel though. You need to experiment using it with water. I style in the shower, and use two pumps per section  of hair (I section my hair in about 8 parts). I emulsify in my hands with a little water and then smooth/rake into my hair. I've noticed that the less water I use, the firmer the hold is (which you may not want) and the more difficult it is to smooth through the hair. So just keep that in mind.",

Ridiculous. Layering product upon product does not work for me; it weighs down the waves. Some products seem to do a good job initially, but have no real hold that lasts beyond an hour. This gel may be a keeper. I washed with Innervision Moisture Bath and Conditioner. Then I used the bowl method to evenly distribute a leave in conditioner, scrunching the water out. I used only a pump of the gel for each side of my soaking wet hair, emulsified with water and evenly applied with \"prayer hands,\" and then scrunched. Then I used a cotton T-shirt to scrunch out the excess water, and diffused until about 85% dry. Once it was dry, I scrunched out the minimal crunch. It clumped nicely and is SO light. It's so wavy, it's maybe an inch shorter! It's a little frizzy, but a little bit of frizz isn't a deal-breaker for me. It has been several hours and it still looks good. Not sure how it will look tomorrow, but I'm please right now.",

        "comments": "I initially bought this in July 2024. I had heard such good things about the brand and this gel and I was extremely excited to try it.  And on wash day my curls were amazing. They honestly were; one friend described my curls as \"effortlessly elegant\" after using this gel.  But the next day my curls were flat and frizzy. When I tried to refresh with water my hair felt like straw; I literally could not add water to it for a refresh. Next wash day when I went to wash out the gel my hair felt hideous. It felt dry,dirty, and coated. I felt like I had to clarify my hair and use a deep conditioner just to fix what this product did to it. But the wash day results were so amazing, I kept trying to \"fix it\". I paired it with other, more moisturizing products. Nothing helped. I waited a few months and tried again in January 2025 thinking somehow winter might help the product work better. No luck. I used this product 8 times. And all 8 times my hair was completely destroyed the next day. I so desperately wanted to find a way for this to work because the wash day results were amazing; but the after effects were so bad. I honestly feel that if I kept using this product I would permanently damage my curls. So I finally gave up and tossed it in the trash. Never again. And, honestly, I probably will not try any other Innersense products because of how awful this gel is. .",

I just tried this gel out (my first gel that I've used in a while) for a wash and go and I'm stunned. After detangling, shampooing, and deep conditioning with a LOT of water, I worked a palm-sized amount into my hair from near root to tip in sections. The key for using this with a kinkier texture is massaging the product with generous amounts of water until it foams up and your curl pattern is more visible (and then topping off with more sprays of water!) Then diffusing to the point where you can air dry  I'm so happy that I purchased this because this just made my life so much easier!",

I've tried a ton of gels and none of them compares to this one, performance wise, smell wise, ingredients wise, or texture wise at all. This styling gel has everything you need in order to make your precious tresses look their absolute best all year round. Now, even though I have wavy hair, this styling gel can be used on all hairtypes and hair textures. You're will see your hair transform into what you've always wanted it to be versus settling with using inferior products that could never give you all that your hair's always needed. You're getting natural goodness in a bottle that is totally safe and non-toxic, a product that truly represents clean beauty just like every product in the Innsersense Organic Beauty line. Because the products are made with mostly water and have small amounts of other ingredients thrown in, you are instead getting a product where there is less water and the main ingredients are put in at high enough amounts to really do the job that they're supposed to and help to give you greater manageability, shine, and control to your hair whether it's straight, wavy, curly, coily, or a glorious combination of any of these hairtypes. If you've ever been anti-gel because the gels that you've tried have either left your hair feeling as dry as a desert or greasy, this will definitely change all that. After trying this gel for the 1st time, I was instantly hooked. It's the only product that I use to style my hair with, and it doesn't leave my hair bone dry and starved for moisture or limp and greasy feeling ever. It give me perfect looking waves everytime, plus it works very well at slicking back my hair when I choose to wear it in a bun too. I highly recommend giving this product a try, as it is a major game changer for ones hair - guaranteed.",

        "comments": "I initially bought this in July 2024. I had heard such good things about the brand and this gel and I was extremely excited to try it.  And on wash day my curls were amazing. They honestly were; one friend described my curls as \"effortlessly elegant\" after using this gel.  But the next day my curls were flat and frizzy. When I tried to refresh with water my hair felt like straw; I literally could not add water to it for a refresh. Next wash day when I went to wash out the gel my hair felt hideous. It felt dry,dirty, and coated. I felt like I had to clarify my hair and use a deep conditioner just to fix what this product did to it. But the wash day results were so amazing, I kept trying to \"fix it\". I paired it with other, more moisturizing products. Nothing helped. I waited a few months and tried again in January 2025 thinking somehow winter might help the product work better. No luck. I used this product 8 times. And all 8 times my hair was completely destroyed the next day. I so desperately wanted to find a way for this to work because the wash day results were amazing; but the after effects were so bad. I honestly feel that if I kept using this product I would permanently damage my curls. So I finally gave up and tossed it in the trash. Never again. And, honestly, I probably will not try any other Innersense products because of how awful this gel is. .",
