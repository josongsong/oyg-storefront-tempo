I ordered multiple versions thinking I got a bad product but they were all bad. Then I found this this product and love it, but I had a hard time tracking it down because it was constantly sold out, so I ordered 3. 1 of the 3 was non useable - dry, scratchy. I'm frustrated and disappointed that my experience with what used to be my go to eyeliner has now been consistently poor products. I'm hesitant to order this product again because I don't trust that I'll receive a good product.",
