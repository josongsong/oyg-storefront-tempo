        "comments": "Kenra  Hair Gloss is honestly one of the best—if not the best—hair gloss I've ever tried. My hair is very dry, and after I blow-dry it, it can look dull and lifeless with no shine at all. The moment I use this gloss, it completely transforms my hair—adding instant shine, softness, and smoothing everything so it looks sleek and healthy. The smell is amazing too! I love it so much that before my bottle even runs out, I make sure to buy another one so I'm never without it.\n\nThe only downside is that it's a little on the pricey side—but if you shop at Ulta, they always have coupons and rewards points you can use, which definitely helps make it more affordable. That's how I keep repurchasing this gem without breaking the bank.",

        "comments": "My hair is very wiry, thin, brittle, and prone to breakage. Left completely natural, it looks like worn out steel wool that has started to unravel, feels like very thin straw, and seems to shed more than my corgi in summer. When flat ironed without product, it kind of just lays flat with no movement. So naturally, I've decided to try and grow it out shoulder length. My reviews are based on how products have helped or hindered that effort, and may not be applicable to your hair type. For me, this product is a MUST HAVE!!! I use it as a finishing gloss after styling and makes my hair feel silky, healthy, and smooth; it adds texture and volume. This product is amazing!!!!",

Only staying fresh for about 3 hours after a shower I was getting frustrated with the dull and tangled mess I was left with so I tried this product. (I had tried the silkening spray prior but it did not work the wonders that this gloss has.) For the first time in two years I love my hair. I apply the serum right after the shower on damp hair, comb it and let it air dry. In the morning I apply more of the gloss before using my straightener to create some bouncy waves and my hair stays shiny, soft, and smooth all day. Never did I think this would be achievable without some kind of chemical treatment. Try this if you are looking for shine, smoothness, silkiness and straight confidence in a bottle. Ps it even holds up in the rain, my hair usually becomes and instant frizzy mist but this saves it. SO HAPPY to have found this product. It's my one and only hair HOLY GRAIL product.",

Secondly, the color I bought this twice before and needed another item for free ship so added this.it is tinted red, all my others were clear,what happened.never noticed it? Formula change? Look st the pic of my towel even after rubbed in,will this tint my o,bre ends? There were also flecks of red in it.i nor ally like this and I love the smell but afraid to use due to was it a return?
