Even tough mascara and \"long-lasting\" formulas come off easily.  the Jelly Pop scent is a bonus.  HIGHLY recommend!",

Then I splash water on my face until it's all cleaned off. Some extra gentle rubbing on waterproof makeup areas with warm water does the trick. I like the included scooper. However, the scent is very artificial and sweet like candy. I really don't enjoy it. Will continue to use the product as I can look past this and it didn't cause breakouts which is the most important. I don't have very sensitive skin in general. Would recommend if you're not sensitive to fragrance.",

I recommend using a fair amount if you wear heavy eye makeup though.",
