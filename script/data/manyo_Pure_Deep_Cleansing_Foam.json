On the bottle, it recommends a pea sized amount foamed up with water and I could probably wash my face at least twice with that amount. It's soft, cleansing, and leaves my skin with a nice glow. My only critique is that while it's advertised as a deep pore cleanser, I haven't seen much change in my pores and I still experience the same amount of spots/blackheads. Regardless, it's wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone looking to add a soothing, bubbly step to their routine.",

I'm pretty sure I have sensitive and acne prone skin (not really sure) so I felt really glad when I noticed this cleanser started working for me, it smells nice and doesn't leave my skin dry after- it actually makes it feel really soft before I even do any of my skincare steps which is a big difference from other cleansers I've used in the past. I would definitely give this cleanser a shot if you've also been struggling to find a right cleanser for your skin like mine😭",

While it worked fabulously for first few days (truly the clearest skin I have ever had) it completely wrecked my skin barrier for the subsequent weeks and gave me the worst acne (upwards of 20+ whiteheads at anytime, very clogged pores) that I am only now getting out of (I stopped using this in July). My recommendation if you are still interested is to use this as weekly cleanser or really slowly ramp up to daily use.",

I'm pretty sure I have sensitive and acne prone skin (not really sure) so I felt really glad when I noticed this cleanser started working for me, it smells nice and doesn't leave my skin dry after- it actually makes it feel really soft before I even do any of my skincare steps which is a big difference from other cleansers I've used in the past. I would definitely give this cleanser a shot if you've also been struggling to find a right cleanser for your skin like mine😭",

While it worked fabulously for first few days (truly the clearest skin I have ever had) it completely wrecked my skin barrier for the subsequent weeks and gave me the worst acne (upwards of 20+ whiteheads at anytime, very clogged pores) that I am only now getting out of (I stopped using this in July). My recommendation if you are still interested is to use this as weekly cleanser or really slowly ramp up to daily use.",
