        "comments": "I received Garnier Skinactive Micellar Cleansing Water through Pinchme complimentary for my honest review. \r\nThe one I received is an all-in- 1 brightener with vitamin C for dull sensitive skin. Which is perfect as my face is combination, but mainly oily in summer and I can at times get dry patches sporadically in summer & winter in random areas of my face. \r\n\r\nI love that this product has no drying agents such as alcohol, no fragrances in case you are sensitive to scents( big benefit, because I'm pregnant - smells can be off-putting at this time), or any added oils to increase grease production on your face.. \r\nAfter using this product for about 2 weeks I did notice it would pick up grime even if I washed my face with only warm water to test out how effective it is. So far I'm impressed that it still had the ability to pick up some grime. I haven't noticed any skin brightening yet. I may still have premature results being 2 weeks and that's not everyday use( every other day, but multi time a day usage). \r\n\r\nMy only drawback for me is it doesn't hydrate, even though it states it's a non drying formula. At times I'm on autopilot or living a rushed hectic lifestyle keeping up with my toddler that I actually forget to apply moisturizer after I use it. Which led me to drying out a bit on my cheeks from washing my face with warm water. This is only due to my previous routine where most of my products I use have some hydrating benefits. So it's really a matter of making a mental note to add some type moisturizer after use. \r\nAnyway, I did notice and thought it was a nice kicker that the bottle is made of 30% recycle plastic. It's nice they are taking into account the environment with there products. \r\nReally nice product, I'm willing to try their other Micellar waters to see if I can find the perfect fit for me. Highly recommend this one for those really looking to avoid additional hydration.",

Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water with Vitamin C not only does what it's supposed to do by gently cleansing but it goes above & beyond by also brightening the skin. I really appreciate the fact that this micellar water does not leave my skin feeling sticky or irritated, which has happened with a few others cleansing waters I've tried in the past. Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water with Vitamin C is gentle enough to be used multiple times a day while being effective enough to sufficiently cleanse the skin without any irritation. Highly recommended!",
