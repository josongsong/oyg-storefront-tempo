I usually use the mouse radiance by Lancome and I decided to try this one for the winter time because my skin was a little drier. \n\nI could not get my make up to budge, especially my mascara!! I was left with smudgy, smeary raccoon eyes. So then I would put more of this cleanser on, try all over again and it still would not remove my make up. One time I even used a toner with cotton pads to see how much make up was left, and it was just alarming!  Yuck. \n\nI wanted something gentle, but if it's not effective why bother? \n\nI would say the milky creaminess of this feels so good on your skin…. It is very soothing. So, that said, if you need something very gentle and don't wear make up or apply it extremely light? Then this might be for you. I am throwing away about 3/4 of this pump, and I feel like I've washed my money down the drain with the cleanser.",

        "comments": "I actually like this product since it only takes a pump or two to melt my makeup or SPF off my face before cleansing. The only issue (which is a dealbreaker for me) is that the formula seems to burn/irritate my skin and especially around the eye area. I was really hoping for this to be a great double cleanser/all around makeup remover but it really fell flat with the irritation. If Lancome reworked the formula to include eye area testing (in another question they stated they did not test this product for the eyes) that would be a GAME CHANGER. Personally. I think any makeup remover should at least not irritate the eyes.",

I use this at night as a makeup remover and cleanser and ot noticeably shrinks my pores and makes my skin silky smooth,soft,and hydrated. I of course still use toner and moisturizer afterwards, but I no longer need to wear a daily moisturizing mask or heavy cream to bed.\n\nI wake up still with smooth, clean and clear looking skin. I have sensitive skin and this is non-irritating; it's actually soothing.\nIn the AM I use Hada Labo Gokujyun cream cleanser which feels very nice, but I love this so much that I'm considering fully switching over for winter.\n\nDefinitely recommend for dry,sensitive,flaky,cold- irritated, or mature skin.\nIt has a scent(almondy), but it isn't very strong. Cleans well without stripping oils, feels like lotion, great gentle makeup remover and cleanser.",

I usually use the mouse radiance by Lancome and I decided to try this one for the winter time because my skin was a little drier. \n\nI could not get my make up to budge, especially my mascara!! I was left with smudgy, smeary raccoon eyes. So then I would put more of this cleanser on, try all over again and it still would not remove my make up. One time I even used a toner with cotton pads to see how much make up was left, and it was just alarming!  Yuck. \n\nI wanted something gentle, but if it's not effective why bother? \n\nI would say the milky creaminess of this feels so good on your skin…. It is very soothing. So, that said, if you need something very gentle and don't wear make up or apply it extremely light? Then this might be for you. I am throwing away about 3/4 of this pump, and I feel like I've washed my money down the drain with the cleanser.",
