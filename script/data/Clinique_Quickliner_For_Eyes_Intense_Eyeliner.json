One of my eyes is a prosthetic, recently fitted after my eye stopped working and was removed; it was injured many years ago and didn't look exactly like the right one. My prosthetic is so good no one can tell. Since I haven't worn eye liner in ages awaiting surgery, I was SOOO looking forward to it. My eyelids are oily and while the cream shapers held up okay and I liked the shimmer in them a lot (I still like Black Diamond, Starry Plum, and Egyptian), they would sometimes smudge in the summer heat and one eye might have no line by the end of the day. Now that it is cooler our heater works overtime at work, so still smudging a tad. The regular quickliners are okay but they don't make my eyes stand out; they had color but were bright, rather than deep, more like wearing eyeshadow than a liner. So I finally ordered Ivy and got it today. It is gorgeous - deep and dark but not like a dark black (although that looks good on me too, but I wanted green to make my new eyes pop! and to be less intense for work) and I'll probably order more colors. With my Black Honey creamwear blush stick, my Peacock eyeshadow, and my bountiful blush/woppin' watermelon chubby stick combination, I am a force to be reckoned with! AWEsome! Thanks, Clinique, for giving me back my confidence to really do up my eyes the way I used to!",

As I wear the regular quickliner, it took me a while to determine that it was only happening on the days I wore the Intense. I wear gas permeable rigid lenses.
