It doesn't even feel like anything is on your lips and lasts for a long time!! I put on lip liner then IT cosmetics je ne sais and then the chanel color, let it dry and put on the clear side. I can change the color slightly by the lip liner I use!!",

It is the only lipstick that stays on for the whole day and doesn't transfer on glass etc. the worse is wearing bright red or pink lipstick only to have it transfer when I have a drink or giving a kiss. This gives the color without the worry of transfer or fading. Stains and these type of lipglosses can be naturally matte, so they included a dual color with clear gloss for a desired shiny finish. I love the bright raspberry color. Perfect for the bright winter color seasons out there!",

        "comments": "I have had eczema nearly of my life and these have been a gamechanger for me. They NEVER break me out. My lips look full, moisturized (as long as I put the gloss over it), and \"put-together\" with these products, especially at work! I only need to re-apply twice at most after eating and drinking. My favorites are Tender Beige (flattering rosy beige, mainly neutral), Intense Caramel (which is slightly pinker and has some shimmer compared to Intense Beige), Soft Rose (which looks like a medium-deep mauve beige on me), Light Brown (1990s-esque medium chocolate), and Soft Coral (the perfect, sunniest red-coral). Strawberry Red is the pinker version of Soft Coral; I have even tried Timeless Beige, which is pale compared to Tender Beige but looks amazing and blendable with a mauve, beige, or brown lipliner for versatile looks. Sensual Rose is a mildly muted creamy rose red, while Bright Raspberry appears to be its magenta counterpart. Merry Rose is a frosty pink that is nearly white; Milky Blueberry is very \"purple-toned\" while Intense Blueberry has hints of mauve, gray, and burgundy. Chic Rosewood is quite mauve depending on your undertone, and looks like the Le Rouge Duo of Chanel's Rouge Coco lipstick in Mademoiselle. I work in healthcare; I swear I don't for Chanel! But for someone with severe skin issues, these have been a dream for me, and I have gifted them to loved ones. \n\nWhat I do is apply the lipcolor first, wait 2-3 minutes, then put the gloss on top for a lasting look.",

        "comments": "I put off buying this for a couple of years. It's expensive and doesn't seem like a lot of product but this is my lipstick preference. I like lipsticks with staying power. I use Maybelline Superstay but I just figured this Chanel would be so much better...maybe less tacky and a better color selection. So when my birthday rolled around I took my rewards points and took the plunge. I'm glad Ulta has such a good return policy and I hadn't purchased straight from Chanel's website. It's not opaque so you need to make several swipes. The one I got seemed dried up already because every time I dipped the applicator in the tube there would just be a little dab on it when I pulled it out, and again, it's not a lot of product to begin with. By afternoon, it was patchy. Sorry, but this is a hard pass for me. Used it twice and returned it.",
