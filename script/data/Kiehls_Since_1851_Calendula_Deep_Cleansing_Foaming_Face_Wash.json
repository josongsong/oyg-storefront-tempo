        "comments": "I used to love this about 10 years ago. But I didn't like that the toner has parabens (even tho I never used the toner) and I wanted a more economical and natural face regimen. So I stopped using this and switched to facial bar soap. I was able to get away with the bar soaps for a good while up until recently. I developed a severe reaction to all the \"natural\" products I'd been using and had to toss them (bad eczema all over my face kind of reaction). I went to ulta in search of skincare that would hopefully do the trick and remembered this guy. I used it for the first time all over again tonight and my itchiness is already gone. Hopefully, it does the trick longterm and I'll probably never stray again.",

At first, I believe my skin was compromised and inflamed when I first tried this and so it stung a lot like a chemical burn (it must be the citrus-based ingredients). But then over time, as my skin healed, it worked great. I bought the 7.8 fl oz bottle over a year ago, and I'm still working through it. My boyfriend also likes using this. I would recommend this for most people with normal skin types, but maybe not if you have extremely sensitive skin due to the acidic ingredients.",

I used it a few nights in a row and was sold! My skin was quickly gaining its moisture back and the redness was getting soothed. The key to the product is that a little goes a long way. Pump a pea sized amount and lather it together on your fingers then apply it to your face and wash your face. One bottle of this lasted me over a year, definitely worth the money to me. I follow it with the ultra repair moisturizer and my skin has never been better. I have very sensitive skin and this moisturizer has changed my life for the better. I recommend this to all my friends and turned them on to it. I will forever use this!!!!",

Its simple, lathers nicely, has a naturally pleasant smell (from the calendula flower and essential oils) and lasts a long time. Love that the pump locks for travel as well. The essential oils in this product might be irritating if you are going through intense treatments or exfoliation so watchnout for that but as a daily cleanser this is a wonderful option.",

        "comments": "I have bought Calendula Deep Cleansing Foaming Face Wash in Kiehl's website. This was my first time to purchase this product after the recommendation of my friend. Firstly, I think the product had the well-packaged box to delivery when I received. The first time when I opened it, the smell of calendula attracted me a lot. Before I review the effects of the product, I would like to talk about my own condition of my personal information and skin type.\n• Gender: Female\n• Age: 22\n• Skin type: Combination\n• Skin concern: Visible pores\nI was looking for something that would balance my skin and not dry so that I have tried several cleaners, but did not find it yet until now. According to my own condition, I love this cleanser after I used it. It did a good job of balancing. The description said that the cleanser would fit the normal to oilskin type and make skin loos instantly refreshed and revitalized. I really think the product did well on that. It removes my make up really well and leaves my skin feeling very clean and not dry. Within the first week of use, my existing blemishes had begun to clear up and lighten and to my surprise, I have no new acne. Now, after couple weeks of use, my skin condition seems better than before. I have bought 250ml, the one you can use for 2 years from the time you open it, but, I used the product everyday; I think it can be used for almost three months, and I will rebuy it later to keeping using that. I think I would be a big fan of Kiehl's product and willing to trying other product related to my skin type.\nAlso. The design of bottles can be used convenient and controlled the usage each time. I agree with the effects on my skin based on what the product descripted. I am satisfied with the product, which is worth my money. If I have a friend with same skin condition with me, I will recommend the product to them.",

        "comments": "This is my 100% honest review of this face wash.\n\nI went to purchase from Kiehl's for the first time. I wanted a moisturizer. My skin is mostly oily, but I was experiencing some dry patches on my cheeks because of winter. I expressed this to the saleswoman. I was given three samples of different lotions that were way too greasy for my skin type (maybe they will work for another skin type, such as facial eczema).\n\nI knew I also needed a facial wash. The associate told me it would be perfect for my skin. I did not receive a sample but trusted the expert in her chic lab coat. I love that touch to the store!\n\nI purchased this wash and it was drying for all parts of my face. My oily T zone was just as dry as the flakey cheeks. Luckily, this product did not add anymore flakiness.. I was hoping for a product that would nourish my skin that I could use daily. This product would probably work well if I had clogged pores from wearing a lot of makeup and not washing the face consistently. I will probably use it once a month when I feel my skin needs to be stripped a bit or in summer.\n\nIt had a lot of product in the bottle, but the price and lackluster results did not match up\n\nI do not like this enough to give away as a gift.\nI do not recommend for dry skin at all, combination skin or sensitive skin. Maybe someone with acne prone skin would love this. I personally could never use this daily.\n\nI wish I was given samples first so I would want to return. I ended up loving products from another place that gave samples in all products.\n\nI will return to Kiehls's for body lotions and conditioners in the furure",
