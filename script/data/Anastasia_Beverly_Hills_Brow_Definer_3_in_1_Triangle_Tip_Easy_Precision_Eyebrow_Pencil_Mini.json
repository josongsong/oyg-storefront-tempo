Remember all ABH products are highly pigmented, so little pressure is required.Start by defining the brow shape. Comb the hairs upward with the spoolie. Then, using the flat side of the pencil tip, outline the bottom of the brow from arch to tail. Next, comb the hairs downward and outline the top of the brow from arch to tail with the flat side. Comb the hairs back in place and fill in the brow from arch to tail using the medium side of the tip. Next, detail the front of the brow by creating hairlike strokes using the fine tip. Starting at the base of the front of the brow, press the tip down and pull up in the direction of the hair's natural growth. Use this technique in areas where there is empty space. Continuously blend throughout.PRO TIPS·Use the fine tip to create hairlike strokes by applying light pressure and swiping in the direction that hair grows naturally.·Perfect for quick, on-the-go application, use the flat side of the pencil to outline the top and the bottom of the brow, then shade in the center.·Keep Brow Definer sharp by lightly swiping the tip on a piece of paper.

They are a major insecurity of mine and I struggled for quite a few years looking for some kind of solution to help with them. This is the only product I have found that completely and effortlessly makes a night and day difference with them. Super easy to work with, pencil glides smoothly, convenient spoolie, and color is very natural looking but buildable if a more dramatic look is needed. Amazing quality and I have always gotten quite a bit of use out of mine before needing to replace it. Price is on the higher end but for the quality and length in between replacing it is more than worth it.",

But now that I am back, I plan to start writing/posting more and share many moments (all sorts of them) with you. I'd like to write about different things, including my childhood memoreis, how I ended up in the United States, my life here. I will also be writing about some girly things like what make up I like, where I buy my clothes, how I do my nails. Btw, I will continue sharing interesting quotes and throwback music videos. If there is anything  you'd like to know about me, please leave a comment under any of my posts. I will really appreciate your feedback. Always! Sending lots of positive vibes your way, and welcome to my IG page! 💋💋💋 #letsgetstarted #staywithme #spring2019",

Because they all have always seemed too dry, too hard and the small round tip they all have, seems to be ill shaped for what it is meant to be used for. I have always used brow powders/mousses/pomades. I also do not have \"instagram\" brows. My brows a already shaped and decently full, I just use brow products to define and darken, since my hair is colored much darker than my natural color (see picture for reference). \n\nAnyways- I picked this up as I was getting tired of my usual brow products and the shape of this intrigued me. I have been using it for about 2-3 weeks and am very happy with it. I love the angled tip which allows me to draw even lines of all shapes and sizes and to quickly fill in large spaces. I can make the lines lighter or darker, depending on how hard I press and if I press too hard, the bristled end does a great job of \"fixing\" the issue. I don't understand why some reviewers consider this large and chunky? Maybe b/c they are used to using a tiny dot sized brown pencil? Heck if I know. This hasn't dried out at all nor has it wore down much. I still have a lot of product left AND this item is more than twice the amount of product you get with the brow wiz (0.003 vs. 0.007)(see attached pic). It also doesn't flake or crumble during application and the color does not fade during the day. Overall, excellent brow product that I will continue to use.",

Since I love AB I thought I'd try out one of their brow pencils for a quicker application, but which one-  Brow Wiz or Brow Definer?  I watched all the Youtube videos, read all the reviews, and decided the brow definer was the one. I was so excited to try it and man was I so terribly disappointed. The pencil reminds me of the very bottom of the pomade when it's dried and crumbly. I have to apply so much pressure when using this pencil that I've literally taken out brow hairs with every pass. Faint color, product feels dry, and the triangular tip feels too big and does nothing to give my brows shape. I wish I didn't spend money on this product.",
