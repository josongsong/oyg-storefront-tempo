I was persuaded to buy the product from an employee who should have known not to recommend a product with fragrance as we know it is not good for acne prone skin. Not to mention she knew I had acne prone and dry skin two things that are horrible with fragrance. Also the fragrance was not talked about only the fact that it will help you with the \"PH\" but t lets be honest it is not a great option for anyone! SO mad that an employee tried to convince me to buy it too. Also, the bottle in the store had the new packaging and the one I was convinced to buy had old packaging covered with the new one. hint hint they the store clerks are trying to get rid of product... thats unacceptable too!!",

Plus it leaves my skin feeling so clean and I don't use anything but my hands. I'm amazed every time I use it because I use white towels in the master bathroom and no residue is left. I LOVE THIS CLEANSER, it's the only the only one that does everything and doesn't cause any redness. My skin is so sensitive even typical makeup removers and other high end cleansers usually leave my face red. But this is the first one that takes everything off and causes no redness. \nYou also only need to use a dime size amount for it lather up and clean your face and neck. One bottle has lasted me over 3 months.",

I was persuaded to buy the product from an employee who should have known not to recommend a product with fragrance as we know it is not good for acne prone skin. Not to mention she knew I had acne prone and dry skin two things that are horrible with fragrance. Also the fragrance was not talked about only the fact that it will help you with the \"PH\" but t lets be honest it is not a great option for anyone! SO mad that an employee tried to convince me to buy it too. Also, the bottle in the store had the new packaging and the one I was convinced to buy had old packaging covered with the new one. hint hint they the store clerks are trying to get rid of product... thats unacceptable too!!",
