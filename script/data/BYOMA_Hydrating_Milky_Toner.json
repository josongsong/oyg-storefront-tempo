I have always had sensitive skin that reacts/turns red to most skincare products, especially after dermaplaning my face. However, I recently dermaplaned and applied this product immediately after and did not have any redness or burning! I can tell that it really hydrated my face afterwards. I also use topical retinoids and struggled with my makeup pilling around my nose and mouth. Since using this product consistently and right before applying makeup, I can tell I don't get that pilling/dry look even after wearing my makeup all day anymore!! I really only bought this product to help with the dryness from my retinoids but I have been nicely surprised by all the additional benefits I have been getting from it!! I will continue to repurchase this product. The benefits, especially at the price point, are great and I am a BYOMA girly through and through now!",

        "comments": "I really wanted to love this product. Everyone raves about it and how amazing it is to help skin feel and look hydrated, plumped, and ready for makeup. The product itself feels really nice on the skin and does make my skin look and feel hydrated and plumped. I liked how it felt going on the skin and was never left with any sort of sticky or slimy feeling on my skin after using. The toner has a nice milky consistency and you get a lot of product for the price. Definitely would take me a while to go through a bottle and I was using it daily, sometimes twice a day (AM and PM). \n\nI already struggle with cystic acne around my jawline and on the sides of my face and chin, but since November of last year (2024) I noticed that it was becoming much worse. I started developing more cysts and as soon as those would clear, more would form. I even started to get them under my ears, which had never been a spot I would get them before. I randomly saw a TikTok about the Byoma Milky Toner being the cause of acne in some users, so I decided to test the theory and stop using it for a while to see if this was the culprit. Within literally a couple of days, I noticed the cystic acne diminishing and I was not getting any new cystic pimples. I have since stopped using the toner  and my cystic acne has improved drastically. I have no idea what ingredient in this toner causes my skin to freak out, but unfortunately it is not for me. \n\nI would still recommend the toner to others but would caution to test it out with your skin for a bit before deciding to incorporate it fully into your routine. Had I done this first, I would have saved myself money and saved my skin from the trauma of worsened cystic acne. This is still a great product but just was not for me and didn't work with my skin.",
