        "comments": "I agree with most of the other negative reviews about this product. my skin is more light than medium so the banana color should have brightened my under eye area but it didn't, like others it just disappeared. then when I put it on it was thick, shiny, and pilled under my makeup. I never used this as a concealer or color corrector, so maybe layering all this products on top didn't agree with the cream, but when I used it alone while sleeping, if I rubbed my eye, which when using this product happened a lot, it just rolled up in balls and flaked off.  not good in my opinion. I feel that after an hour of wearing it should absorb. I think they wanted this product to brighten and \"blur\" but it doesn't, it just pills horribly with any pressure when applying makeup or touching your under eye area.",

I've been to the dermatologist numerous times but nothing helped. until this. I bought it because I saw a TikTok and figured, \"Why not?\", and I'm very glad I did. I love this stuff. it's very moisturizing and clean. it gives a bit of shimmer to help with my undereye bags. I'll keep buying it unless the recipe changes. I also have the facial lotion with sunscreen, but that's a different review.",

It worked well under makeup for me. My undereyes are not very dry so I typically use a thin eye cream (such as the Inkey List eye creams) under makeup, but this worked as well. Would be excellent for people with dry undereyes! Really does brighten too, the tint is as pictured, and has extremely fine shimmer in the formula to add to the brightening effect. Not noticeable unless you get super close to the face.",

        "comments": "I sit on the tail end of medium-light, sometimes (depending on the brand) I'm labeled medium when it comes to foundation. I have a cool undertone, and I would say this cream in the medium/deep shade is perfect for me. I'm mixed race, I have very dry, sensitive skin. I suffer with eczema, pretty severe post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation in the eye area, and I have very narrow deep-set eyes that extenuate the discoloration. This product looks beautiful. It helps reduce the appearance of the hyperpigmentation, and I've been able to use it in place of hydrocortisone ointment I was using to treat the eczema. My eyes never feel dry, and the moisture lasts all day as long as I don't wipe or wash it away. I've purchased it twice now. It lays beautifully under makeup. It's easy to use, and you don't need a lot to get great results. I've only been using it for close to 3 months now. I don't currently notice any fading of the discoloration itself, but I think the factors I've listed previously would make that a pretty impossible expectation to meet for a skincare product. Especially considering that I haven't used it that long. So I can't speak to long term effects. If I have the ability to update this review, I would gladly share more about the effects of long term use, but for now I'm really happy with my purchase.",

I thought it would be temporary, but this last time, it made a red swollen welt under my eye. It's safe to say I gave it a fair try. I must be allergic or something in it isn't good for my skin.",
