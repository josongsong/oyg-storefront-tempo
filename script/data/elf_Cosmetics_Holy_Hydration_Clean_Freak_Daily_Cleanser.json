        "comments": "I received this for free from e.l.f. and BzzAgent in exchange for my honest review. That being said, I'm reviewing as though I spent my own money on this. \n\nI have used a gentle cream to foam cleanser from another brand for a few years now. It's about three times the price of this with less product, but I had never found a cheaper option that cleanses as gently and compatibly for a lower price. I'm ecstatic to report that I may now finally be able to spend so much less on a cleanser, because this Holy Hydration! Clean Freak cleanser seems to be working just as well. I've maintained the rest of my skin care and makeup routine and simply replaced the cleanser. My face looks fresh and hydrated after cleansing, ready for serum and moisturizer. My makeup melts away easily, which is a bonus because my old cleanser was lacking in this area. I have not experienced any redness, breakouts, or sensitivity since using this. The bottle is huge, especially at this price point. I admit that I wasn't expecting this quality for this product, but I'm wildly impressed and will probably purchase this when the bottle is empty. Highly recommended.",

        "comments": "I've used this for a couple of weeks now and while my face hasn't flared up / get irritated, I wouldn't purchase this cleanser after finishing it. I have oily skin and the consistency of this cleanser is like the Cetaphil cleanser. It's very liquidy and not thick in consistency so it feels like I'm laddering water down hand sanitizer on my face. I prefer a thicker consistency to my cleanser because it gives me the feeling that it's working hard to clear all the dirt off of my face even if it foams up. I will say this does the job but it doesn't really give you a refresh clean feeling. \n\nThis is great for the morning / beginner as it's an easy way in. The way i like to use these type of cleansers that foam is to wet my face and squeeze out a penny size amount and then gently lather across my face and it'd foam up vs putting water in your hand and foaming it like that.",
