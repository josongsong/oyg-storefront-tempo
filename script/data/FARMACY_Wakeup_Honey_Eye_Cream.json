I dont like that it makes my liquid eyeliner almost impossible to put on. Even just a little amount of this is too heavy and greasy for my pen to stick and it ends up fading or rubbing off before the day is over and I look like I showed up to work in yesterday's makeup. Its embarassing and disappointing that it does this so I cant use it in the AM unless its a day I dont plan to wear makeup.",

Most of the eye creams for bags did a better job of shrinking the bag but then there were more wrinkles and my makeup wouldn't blend well. This one may not offer the best shrinkage of bags but it allowed a healthy under eye glow, nourishment and subtle shrinkage. I could adjust this review if needed but I would think its better for the eye not to contract so much anyway. That could make wrinkles worse. Best part of this one is it's safe for eyelids. I am sure over time the look of my eye bags will improve too. But due to nourishing not a temporary tightening.",

        "comments": "If you're anything like me, the first thing you notice in the morning isn't the birds chirping—it's the tired, puffy eyes staring back at you. Enter Farmacy's Wake Up Honey Eye Cream—a brightening eye cream that feels like a small miracle in a jar. I've been testing this for a few weeks now, and let me tell you, it's become a permanent part of my routine. Let's start with the texture: it's buttery, smooth, and oh-so-luxurious. The moment I dab it under my eyes, it just melts into my skin like honey on warm toast. No tugging, no sticky residue—just pure, hydrating goodness that makes my under-eye area feel nourished and pampered. What makes this eye cream a standout is its clinical formula. The 3% vitamin C (THD ascorbate) works overtime to visibly brighten dark circles. And let's talk about those mornings when the puffiness makes me look like I pulled an all-nighter (even though I didn't). That's where the encapsulated caffeine and upcycled cranberry peptide come to the rescue—instantly depuffing and smoothing the fine lines around my eyes. I'm not exaggerating when I say I've noticed a visible difference in the intensity of my dark circles. And if hydration is your thing, this cream delivers that in spades too. The proprietary buckwheat-honey blend and hyaluronic acid give my skin a plump, dewy finish that feels as good as it looks. It's so hydrating that my concealer glides on like a dream afterward—no creasing, no caking, just flawless application. Another detail I love? It's dermatologist-tested, ophthalmologist-approved, and completely safe for sensitive eyes like mine. Even after long days or sleepless nights, this cream never irritates my skin. Who is this for? Honestly, anyone who wants to brighten, depuff, and hydrate their under-eye area while smoothing fine lines over time. Whether you're dealing with stubborn dark circles or just want to add a touch of luxury to your routine, this eye cream checks all the boxes. Farmacy's Wake Up Honey Eye Cream doesn't just brighten my eyes—it elevates my mornings. If you've been on the hunt for an eye cream that feels indulgent yet clinically effective, this one deserves your attention. My tired eyes are officially hooked!",

        "comments": "I like the consistency of the cream and how it's brightened the skin around my eyes and helped hydrate my eyelids, which were so dry and irritated from the freezing cold that they were flaking and peeling. I dont like that it makes my liquid eyeliner almost impossible to put on. Even just a little amount of this is too heavy and greasy for my pen to stick and it ends up fading or rubbing off before the day is over and I look like I showed up to work in yesterday's makeup. Its embarassing and disappointing that it does this so I cant use it in the AM unless its a day I dont plan to wear makeup.",
