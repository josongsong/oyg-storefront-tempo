The texture is lightweight but super hydrating — it gives my lips a soft, healthy glow without feeling sticky or greasy. It instantly soothes dryness and actually keeps my lips moisturized for hours, which is rare for me.\n\nThe applicator is sleek and mess-free, and the formula layers really well under lip balm or even lipstick. I love using it as a treatment before bed or a glossy touch during the day. Bonus points for the clean ingredients and how cute the packaging is!\n\nIf you struggle with dry or chapped lips, this is a must-try. My lips have never felt better!",
