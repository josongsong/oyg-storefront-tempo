Le Disque gives a nice gentle exfoliation that feels like my face is really getting the cleaning it deserves. It also feels like i'm getting some lymphatic stimulation which is an added bonus. The little rubber prongs? ..not sure what to call them are soft and glide over the skin beautifully. It doesn't feel harsh at all like most exfoliating products. Loving this new product by Dore.",
