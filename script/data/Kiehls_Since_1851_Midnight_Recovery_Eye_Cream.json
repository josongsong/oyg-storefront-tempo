This one works fairly well, it leaves the area nicely moisturized and I do think it helps to slightly lessen my dark circles.  Frankly, the only thing that will REALLY work is fillers at my age (51) but I really want to avoid that.  The caffeinated eye creams just make my under eye more crepey so those are out.  Several of the more expensive creams that promise to help with dark circles do nothing.  I think this cream is nicely priced for how little it takes and how long the tube lasts and the fact that it actually does work, even if it's not dramatic.  I don't find the scent to be noticeable, as others have described.  I'll continue to purchase it.",

        "comments": "I've been trying a few different products to help my eyes from looking less tired and puffy, while also balancing naturally sourced ingredients. This so far seems to be a good balance. The puffiness did seem subtly better the next morning, but not super dramatic as far as I could tell. It did take a couple weeks for really noticeable and sustained differences, but my under eye area is much less puffy and fatigued looking. It applies smooth and leaves a silky, hydrated feeling. I don't have an issue with dark circles, so I can't comment on that but I think it helps with fine lines too (I don't have much of those yet either). You only need a very tiny amount, like half a pea size for both eyes. I began just using it nightly for the first week, no adverse reactions, and now use it morning and night with more noticeable results. I plan to be a repeat buyer with this.",

I've been using This & their \"Youth Dose Eye Treatment\" since late October 2019. Around December 2019, I began to notice that my dark circles looked much lighter... the kinda shade where I found no need to wear concealer- \"maybe\" a little if I wanted to look Flawless BUT I seriously haven't even bothered! It has to be THIS as nothing else has changed in my regimen. And I have NOT had these results ever before. To make sure it wasn't all in my head I asked my husband- He absolutely agreed. He remembers how my dark circles looked- so I'm not imagining things LoL! There is a little shade but it's natural looking but NOT compared to what it was before! On a scale of 1-5... My dark circles were a 3. I really didn't think Kiel's would help at all just like the countless others that claim they do and DON'T! - BUT ALAST I have found it!!! Again, I do also use the other eye cream they make as well. 1.) Midnite Recovery @ nite and 2.) Youth Dose during the day. They both have made a Big difference. It took 2.5 mons to experience results but I'm saying YES everyday to No under eye concealer and to feeling like OH YES I LOOK GOOD! \nI feel so much better about the way I look; it's been so long that I've felt this confident again.\nFor reference I'm a medium skin tone & don't get as much sleep as I should LoL!",

I was kind of desperate to try this because I have really bad dark circles.. Not even from lack of sleep but just because that's the color of my undereyes always (for whatever reason). Well to get to the point I bought this cream and the scent was so gorgeous and a little does go a long way. However the cream seemed to do nothing for my undereye dark circles and I've been testing it out for about a month now, night and day! I also have very fine lines around that area (I'm only 22) but they seemed to remain the same. I can't say whether or not this product helped with undereye puffiness because have none. But I just wanted to share my experience in case any of you were hesitant on spending the 36 or so dollars and have the same undereye situation as me. I will continue using the bottle up because the scent I s really soothing and I'm hoping it will magically work one day.. But nothing yet. Also, even after about a month of using twice a day I still have so much product left.. So it will probably take me another two months or so to use it up completely. Hope this helped!",
