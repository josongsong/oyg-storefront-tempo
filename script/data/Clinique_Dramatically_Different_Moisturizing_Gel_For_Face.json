A tiny amount is all you need! I've been using the same bottle for two months and still have plenty! Also the pump is wonderful! It keeps everything clean and convenient! I highly recommend anyone with oilier skin to give this a try! Great work Clinique!",

I wish I would have known these facts before purchasing these items.\n\nI don't break out all that often, but was having a bout of constant breakouts and I couldn't find anything that worked. I switched my whole face cleansing routine to clinique products since they were allergen tested and supposed to be good for sensitive skin. I was doing everything I was supposed to, but yet still breaking out even more than before I started using Clinique.\n\nI discovered that this gel has three ingredients in it that are listed among the highest of comedogenic (acne aggrevating) ingredients. They are Laureth-4, Laureth-23, and Oleth-10. Laureth-4 is rated a 5 on the comedogenic scale, which is the highest you can go! I stopped using this product and began using a face wash and simple lotion that are both paraben free and non-comedogenic, That together only cost me $12, and in just one week my face is completely acne free. I do not recommend this product.",
