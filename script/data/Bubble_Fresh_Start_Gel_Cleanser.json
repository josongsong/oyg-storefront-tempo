While neutrals are in, the kid in me will forever be attracted to colorful things. \n\nI got travel minis to try this and the blue gel cleanser is my absolute favorite - i bought it full size. While im 30, i still struggle with acne sometimes and im super oily in summer and dry in winter. This thoroughly cleans my face, while still feeling comfortable. My face looks brighter and ive noticed less acne or spots using this. I have sensitive skin as well - no issues for me. \n\nI have ditched everything i use for this line. While im sure its not as rich as products designated for maturing skin, i contest that their products at high dollar doesnt even work that good. This is affordable AND works. \n\nThank you for this line. Please do not ever make the mistake of changing formulas. Your products have good reviews for a reason.",

Then the company closed and I proceeded to have some of the worst acne I had since my teen years as I tried so many different products. Hundreds of dollars and a year later, I decided to give this Bubble gel cleanser a try. After the first use I noticed how soft my face felt, and within 2 weeks almost all the acne I had cleared up. I use this in combination with the cocokind electrolyte water cream, the ordinary nicainamide, and murad acne control pads, and now my face is soft, clear, and I've even noticed a difference in the fine lines on my forehead. Thank you Bubble for making such a wonderful product, and please never change it!",

However there is a reason pump bottles have long necks. The pump is just too short. You cannot put your hand underneath. You need to pick up the bottle and pump sideways into your palm and even then product still trails down the bottle. I get aesthetics are a thing but just make the bottle normal, please.",

With that being said, I can truly say that this cleanser works for me without a doubt, and I don't have those issues when I use it. I use 3 pumps to clean my skin and I follow up with their \"Slam Dunk\" hydrating moisturizer (a little of that goes a long way). I'm about to purchase a second bottle and the vitamin C serum (I don't remember the full name; I just know it's in a small yellow bottle). \nThey have won me over. The fact that you have to tilt the bottle to use it is a small price to pay compared to buying a product and wasting your money. Finally a product that actually does what it says it does.",

I read that one of the ingredients is not really good for sensitive skin in one of the reviews (this was AFTER I got it). For me, it kind of dryed my skin out (not to the point I'm peeling though) and made my skin feel sensitive. It could be that it was delivered to my house instead of me getting it at Ulta, but I don't know. I think it's just that it's made more toward oily skin because of an ingredient called red algae extract, which in the pics they state helps control oil production, which dry skin types don't need. So I think it would be great for someone else with non-sensitive and skin. So I recommend it for people with oily and non-sensitive skin. If you do have dry and or sensitive skin, I rcecommend Soft Launch because that is amazing for me so far. So yeah. Bye yall💖💅🏼",
