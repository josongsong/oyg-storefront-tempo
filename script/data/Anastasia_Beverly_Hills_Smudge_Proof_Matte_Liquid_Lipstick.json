I put a little dab to cover the spot thinking I missed a spot but it didn't work so I had to layer another coat on my lips. After eating I had to wipe the color off my lips because it looked like I peeled chunks here and there off. Horrible purchase. Highly disappointed after reading \"great\" reviews on it.",
