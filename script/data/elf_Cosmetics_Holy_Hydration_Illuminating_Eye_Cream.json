Not the skin but my actual eyeballs which is strange because it does not really have a strong scent. It is a nice, light cream that absorbs well and has a pretty glimmer to it. I feel like my under eyes look brighter and moisturized but the amount of burning it causes my eyeballs is terrible. 😭",

Price.  It is one of the best eye creams for the price point.  \n\n3. You can wear your eye make up over it with no problem. Even if you are in a rush give it about 20 -30 sec it dries and you can your eye shadow and eyeliner goes on smoothly.\n\n4. No scent.  If you are sensitive to scents this is perfect for you.\n\n5.  Goes on smoothly.  It is not thick or clumpy goes on smoothly.\n\n6.  Does not burn if it gets in your eyes.  I work out a lot and I have never had this eye cream burn my eyes like some.  \n\n7.  Moisturizing.  It is moisturizing without being oily or greasy.  It settles in the skin very nicely.",

I used it for a couple of weeks and all was great. suddenly my undereye got very dry and every Concealer I was using and every makeup remover felt like it was irritating it. after buying 3 other makeup removers to try and 3 other concealers over the past two weeks I was examining my daily routine to try to find out was exactly was causing it. I came to the realization that the eye cream was my newest product. I have now stopped using it and will have to work on repairing the damage that was done. I'm only 21 and the dryness under my eye has made me feel like I look much older. I am not happy with this product. I've never been known to have sensitive skin, but I might.",
