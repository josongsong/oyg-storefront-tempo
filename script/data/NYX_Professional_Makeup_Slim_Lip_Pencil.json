Pale Pink is my go to colour for under almost all of my lipsticks on a regular basis. Not only does it help keep the lipstick in the lines(no running anywhere), but it also keeps my lipstick on through straws, food, and anything else that comes my way! The selection of colours is incredible and I love the consistency of the more matte ones! I'm not a big fan of the shiny ones(like Petal), but the matte ones are so creamy that sometimes I wear them alone!",
