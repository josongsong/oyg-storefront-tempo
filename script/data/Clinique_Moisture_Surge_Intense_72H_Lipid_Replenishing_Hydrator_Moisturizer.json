My skin barrier was wrecked and because of that my skin felt so dry/dehydrated that nothing seemed to moisturize my skin. I gave this cream another shot and completely RESTORED MY SKIN BACK TO HEALTH! I hope that enough people realize how good this cream is so Clinique will continue to produce it. It feels heavy/greasy at first application, so let it sit for a minute and then it sort of melts from the temp of your skin and you can massage it into your skin more. The ingrediants are amazing too. Has centella asiatica which is great for calming my redness. I will be repurchasing. I now use mostly as a night cream but I will use in the morning if my skin is feeling more sensitive.",

        "comments": "I have been a dedicated user of Moisture Surge Intense (most recent name Moisture Surge Intense: Skin Fortifying Hydrator) for many years. In my teens and early twenties, my facial skin was dry, irritated, sensitive, and acne prone. I was overjoyed to discover Moisture Surge Intense in my mid-twenties as the only product that transformed my skin to be hydrated, soothed, and clear of breakouts. I have used it as my exclusive morning and night moisturizer for at least a decade now and wouldn't even try other moisturizers.\n\nI was dismayed to receive my last order a few months ago and find it had a new name (Moisture Surge Intense: 72h Lipid Replenishing Hydrator) and a new color (now white rather than light pink), but was willing to give it a shot to see if the formula was the same or at least comparable. Unfortunately this was not the case. A few minutes into use, this moisturizer seemed to vanish completely and my skin started to feel dry and tight. A few days into use, my skin was feeling dry and irritated and this moisturizer caused burning and redness. A week or two into use, my skin was completely dehydrated with deep, painful acne spots.\n\nI have since tried several other products to try and fill the hole in my skincare routine left by my discontinued holy grail. I set aside my frustration with Clinique and begrudgingly tried both the Moisture Surge 100h Auto-Replenishing Hydrator and the Turnaround Overnight Revitalizing Moisturizer. I have also tried more than 10 moisturizers marketed for dry and sensitive skin from other brands. Nothing compares to the original Moisture Surge Intense. My skin is a mess and nothing has worked to bring it back to a happy state.\n\nPlease, please, please bring back the original Moisture Surge Intense formula! This updated formula may work for many with less sensitive and dry skin, but for me it is unusable.",
