        "headline": "Colors are accurate to contour with",
        "comments": "I like the color and that its non-comedogenic. It has been tough to find contour products that don't break me out. Finding true contour colors (neutral to cool. Slightly gray or dull) is also hard, no matter the price point. I don't love the sponge tip applicator, but it does work to apply a thin layer of the product. I also prefer the experience of cream contour sticks, but every single stick product I have tried, except a discontinued foundation from way back when, has broken me out. I've had the same problem with cream bronzers like the Nars Laguna Cream bronzers. Breakout city.\n\nI had to struggle a bit to find a way to apply this to my face shape, but it's not because it's not easy to blend. The problem was my selection of brush and my placement. I'm using now the Rephr LC02 complexion brush which is very similar to the BK beauty 109 Mini Contoured Foundation: a small, dense, angled brush. I place my pointing finger under my cheekbone pointing at the top of my mouth, and then I stamp dots along the finger, using it as a guideline. I blend in patting motions over the dots, and then patting upwards a little, and at the ends, I sweep downwards over the bottom outer 1/2 of the face, to lower the contrast between the cheek contour and my foundation shade.\n\nI will keep on repurchasing and would recommend. Its not a 5 stars product, but it does the job, the longevity is decent even in hot weather, its easy to use, and the color is right. Of utmost importance, its also non-comedogenic. I plan to buy the Kevin Acoin powder contour next month. Its the ONLY powder contour I've found that doesn't have the typical comedogenic red-dyes. It might still be a problem, but I'm crossing my fingers. If it fails, back to this one it is.",

I get really bad acne where it's applied. This could be related to the applicator, going directly on your skin over and over again. I'm going to clean and sanitize the tip and hopefully that decreases the acne.",

I dint normally buy this brand but it's exactly what i was looking for. I have light skin tone and the lightest color is great, cool tone as it should be. Small applicator applies easily and blends out evenly.",

Haven't seen if it can survive summer heat so this might change. \n\n I was hesitant to purchase this because I do have the putty bronzer in feelin' shady and I do not like that product because it completely blends away. The colors are similar, but not the same, this blends but I can actually still see this one after my face makeup is done and I put the translucent powder. It's hard to find a good cool contour this shade so far is my favorite. I think a few of these could be used on me as more of a bronzer on me so I might grab one when they restock for that. I had no problems with blending this into the blush, highlight, or the cream bronzer that I decided to use with this. It's not patchy at all. My only problem was the sponge and I rip that off.",
