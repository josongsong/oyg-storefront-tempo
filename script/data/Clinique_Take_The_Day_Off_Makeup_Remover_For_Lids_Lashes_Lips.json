My dream is to find one that cuts through all of my makeup in one swipe, leaves no residue, is easy to use, and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. Bonus points for cute packaging and good value!\n\nMake up removing effectiveness: 3/5\nI found I did not have to do a lot of scrubbing, but did have to do some.\n\nResidue: 3/5\nThe residue isn't the worst, but it is definitely present and not pleasant.\n\nSkin feel: 2/5\nIt doesn't sting my eyes themselves, but does burn a little on the delicate skin surrounding. It feels a little oily. \n\nEase of use: 2/5\nThe child proof cap is a little annoying and I wish I had control over the rate it dispensed with a different cap. \n\nValue: Overpriced for what it does\nEmpty? Yes. I used my whole bottle. It works as intended, just not a holy grail.",

One, the smell is strange and off-putting (not that I'm saying put a fragrance in- please don't!- but it's still a bit unpleasant). It also leaves a pretty greasy finish that makes my face feel less than clean. Mostly, though, for me, the problem was that it's such a little bottle compared to other makeup removers, and it goes really quickly because it has a weird consistency that causes a lot of the product to get sucked into whatever cotton ball/wipe you use.\n\nAll in all, yes it's gentle- but it's not the most practical buy, and I won't be purchasing it again.",
