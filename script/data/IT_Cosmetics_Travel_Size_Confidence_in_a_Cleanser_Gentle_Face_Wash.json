It works well to remove makeup, with the caveat that I typically do fairly light makeup (tinted moisturizer,  concealer,  eyeshadow, and mascara). The only downside is the weird semi-citrus scent. Luckily it's not too strong and dissipates quickly.",

It is not fragrance free like I have read in some reviews(smells like a dreamsicle which is nice albeit strong) I have used other cleansers with some fragrance and have never had this issue. A friend had the same issue with this product and neither of us have what I would consider to be traditional sensitive skin. This was the only new addition to my skincare routine and I do not wear makeup/no change in detergents or other factors to cause a flare up in my skin, and I am still struggling to get the eczema under control and stop spreading.",

This is the only It product that I used! Clarin's is my skincare that I use for almost 20 years. Skincare is not one size fits all and you have to be careful to find the right match for your skin.",

        "comments": "I had tried the confidence in a cream in the past and it was terribly drying on my skin so I gave it to my mother who liked it. When the face wash came out I was reluctant to try it however I bought it anyway. It did the same exact thing so sadly I had to return it. The pros, it is fragrance free and has a creamy consistency.  It removed all of my makeup at the end of the day. The cons, my face felt tight and flaky within minutes of washing my face. I had to rush and moisturize! After abt a week, my face started to break out and my skin was looking less than stellar. I realize everyone's results will be different and I love this brand and will continue to use their other products. I know that I need to stay far away from their Confidence line though.",
