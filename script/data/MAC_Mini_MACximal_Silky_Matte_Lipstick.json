        "comments": "I received this for free from BzzAgent in exchange for my honest review. I got the shade 'Diva', a classic MAC shade in the updated formula. Very happy with it overall. Updating formulas and releasing new products is standard so I don't believe it justifies their continual price jumps. That being said, MAC is the OG and I've been a fan of their products for a couple decades at this point.  If you're not familiar with MAC lipsticks, definitely swatch before buying because the packaging doesn't match the shade. Online photos are pretty accurate, keeping in mind the bullet will look darker. Look at swatches. They didn't try to reinvent the wheel, just improved on something good. Formula's a bit thinner, more comfortable, still pigmented and long wearing. 'Diva' is a very wearable deeper red color with plum/berry undertones that looks elegant paired with a neutral eye look. It's like Ruby Woo and Russian Red's more confident sister. Good for a night out, special occasion, or everyday if you're into a 'power' look. Doesn't stray into goth territory easily like 'Sin' does. It went on smoothly and pigmented. So lightweight it felt like a lip balm and I quickly forgot I was wearing it. Lightly moisturizing. Still has that classic vanilla scent I love. Wears away evenly with a bit less transfer than the previous formula. You'll get a solid 4-6 hours of wear or more depending on how messy your meal/snack is. Not kiss proof but if it's just a peck you'll look good as new and they'll barely get a whisper of color. You'll have to touch up after meals for that just applied look but if you don't, you still have a smooth gradient towards the center to a red stain. Looks flawless through drinks. No feathering, but I still prefer it with MAC's lipliner in \"Plum\" or \"Whirl\". Definitely recommend.",

I really thought I would love it, I received the color Chili which is true to the name-a warm brick red in the tube. On the lips it was more pink than expected. At first it glided on smoothly but with each swipe it started dragging across my lips. It definitely would benefit from using a lip liner to keep it neat around the edges. It also highlights every crease, so your lips have to be pretty smooth to start-although that tends to be the norm with matte formulas. My lips felt dry while I was wearing it but soft after I took it off. That was unexpected. I first swatched it on my wrist and then my lips. It didn't even last 5 minutes before what was on my arm transfered to my shirt. It also smudged around really easily. I was disappointed with the lack of lasting power. I can't imagine it staying on while you eat and drink. I love that there's a rainbow of colors to choose from, but can't justify the price if it is not actually going to live up to it's claims.",
