My skin stayed hydrated all winter with no redness, patches or flakes. This is meant for very dry skin so if you don't have it, then try one of DE's lighter versions. I'm buying my third soon but it only takes a minimum amount. Highly recommend.",

Thats a beautiful, thick moisturizer in a pump bottle just like Drunk Elephants. Its been my holy grail and I was fully prepared for this to not compare. When I tell you I immediately pushed the murad to the side I mean it. This cream is THICK and so hydrating. Winter is coming. If your skin is dry you need this!",

It consistently damaged my skin barrier. I changed no other parts of my routine, which consists exclusively of DE products. I purchased this hoping it was more moisturizing than Lala for winter pm use. After a few days use, my skin became dry patchy and broken out on my cheeks - which was my issue prior to switching to DE 5 years ago. I allowed my skin to recover using only Beste to cleanse in the evening, followed by Protini. Am rinse with water and follow with Protini. After my skin leveled out I tried the product again as my skin is dry in the winter. The same cycle recurred. I kept trying! I wanted this to be the advertised product, but unfortunately this is not effective and did more damage to my skin than it did benefit. I do not recommend this product and wish I could exchange it for Lala.",
