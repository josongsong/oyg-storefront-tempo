This eyeliner is not at all waterproof, it swipes away with even a little bit of water. On the flip side, if you make a mistake on your eyeliner its easy to re-do after wiping it awah some water and a qtip. I will say its a nice dark, black matte eyeliner! So if you're just looking for a good black, NON-waterproof eyeliner then this could be a good pick otherwise try another eyeliner that is actually waterproof.",

        "comments": "I love how a cat eye looks on me & only use liquid liner to help me create a precise fine line with a flicked out wing. I received this liquid liner vox box complimentary in exchange for my honest opinions I was thrilled because liquid liner is a staple in my makeup bag. The new liquid liner by Anastasia Beverly Hills is formulated to be highly pigmented water-resistant with a matte finish. I have to admit that this liquid liner has a better color pay off than my current favorite liner. It does have a true black matte finish. The formulation does stay wet for a little while but once it dries down it stays put & doesn't become dry or flaky throughout the day. One difference I noticed for abh's formulation is that it is labeled as water resistant instead of water proof. What this means is that it's a water based formulation & will not withstand watery eyes crying or rainy weather which is a little problematic as far as creating a winged liner that lasts all day in certain conditions. This means that when it becomes wet this liquid liner will smudge & rub off completely so keep that in mind. Another feature of this liner is the the soft felt-tip applicator. It claims to allow you to make thin precise lines. I have to say that this applicator is not friendly to beginners as it's a long soft & thin applicator making it flexible which I find makes it hard to give you stability when attempting to draw a thin line. I personally am not a fan of this applicator compared to my favorite liquid liner because I find it harder to be precise with this long & flexible felt tip applicator. When it's not wet this formulation holds up well during the day & survived me rubbing my eyes throughout the day. Overall this is a nice vibrant matte finish liquid liner but does not replace my current favorite because it's water resistant not water proof and the applicator makes it difficult to create even thin lines. I rate it 3.0/5.0.",
