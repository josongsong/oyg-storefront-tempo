I then applied my foundation which I think looked better because of the initial oil.  I will definitely continue to use this product.  I also have very sensitive skin so was very happy to find this product was so perfect.",

I originally got a small sample with something I ordered and loved it so much, so when this went on sale for BOGO I of course purchased it. This makes my face feel so soft and look so radiant. A little goes a long way! If you put too much it does make your face feel a little too oily. I have oily skin so when I use this I don't use moisturizer.",

And as soon as I applied it as directed, my skin went red and there was a burning sensation....all over my face.  Noticeably red. Quickly washed it off with Beekman 1802 face soap .... Redness and burning sensation lessened a bit,but it was hours before it finally was gone. Skin still felt gummy though. And I  will say that this is probably a one in a million reaction,because Beekman 1802 products ARE that good.....but it is not for me. \nIt did absorb nicely. But after almost immediate washing skin felt oily. Odor not unpleasant. \nI would recommend trying a sample first, just in case, before you purchase a regular size jar.",

I'm in my 2nd bottle, and loving it. I jus wish it had more product but overall Fantastic or dear I say \"oh!mazing\"",

Sometimes I use it alone under makeup, and other times I do add a dermatologist prescribed tinted sunscreen. I'm 65+ and people comment on my skin not aging. I think the only other product in the past that I've had that was beneficial to my skin was a Sente product that I had years ago. I can no longer use the common store-counter products that retail stores sell. I have environmental allergies and sensitivities (no perfumes or candles), and have been on much prednisone, and periodic breakouts from rosacea. This is a Winner!! I recently was fortunate to buy the product, 2/for a low price on HSN, and it was a great sale. I shop around for the best price, otherwise I'd buy from the Beekman Web site.   Also, I've used the goat milk soap and body cream for years, and the products have made a great improvement on the damage, thinning and wrinkling, that prednisone did to the skin on my arms, making it smooth again. Thank you, Dr. Brent and Josh!!",

No pilling. I have tried with various combos, stupidly hoping it won't pill this time only to have to re-cleanse my face and start over.  This product is a fail for me.  I didn't finish the bottle or even give it away. I just ended up tossing it b/c i missed the return window trying to give it a chance.  #sadtrombone",
