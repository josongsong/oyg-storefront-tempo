        "comments": "I have checked the ingredients first before using this Glow Pad and the first and 2nd row of ingredients are mostly humectants, preservatives, and synthetic formulas but once you go down or in the lower row, you'll start to see natural once. The Olegopeptide-2 is a synthetic peptide but the 1 and 3 aren't. There's Disodium EDTA not our friend but tiny amount or percentage they said won't hurt. (Who knows!) \nI would like to write all the names but I rather what you to see it for yourself. \nConsistency is tacky for me and dries slow unless you will apply it in front of the fan. It does look like it is glowy in your skin because of the formulas mixed in this. I've been using this for a long time now but it just a kind of product that you will use now but it won't make such difference. It is soothing to the skin because of Hydroxyacetophenone a soothing agent. Better use 100% Aloe Vera than this. \nIt is hydrating of course and makes your skin feels so flawless, no bumps, silky smooth (because of Glycereth-26). But I can get all these using other products that uses more natural.",

These pads can be used in two ways, as a mask to target specific areas (place and leave for 5-10 mins) or you can swipe it all around for an all over glow. I love that it comes with tweezers to grab one out with ease. These pads are double sided, one the gel side that holds all the product, and the other plain to help lock in and distribute evenly. Ive been using these morning and night for that glow from within look. After just one use, you can see a noticable glow. My skin feels hydrated and the serum absorbs quickly in the skin without leaving a tacky feeling. I cant wait to continento use this product and even pair it with the PDRN glow serum. \n\nThis product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review.",

They're gentle, non-stripping, and perfect for sensitive skin. The hyaluronic acid gives a boost of hydration, while the PDRN helps with skin texture and bounce over time.

Just wipe it across your skin, and you're done! It really fits into my daily routine without any hassle.After using it for a few days, I noticed a nice glow to my skin. It's like my complexion looked brighter and more alive! The pad also claims to help with skin texture, and I can see that my skin feels a bit smoother.

        "comments": "I love these glow pads for my dry and itchy skin. If I feel like my skin needs more of a boost or something more soothing than just using a serum, I go for these. The pads themselves are soaked in serum and my skin soaks it up! There is very little, if any, fragrance. I use these after cleansing and my irritated skin feels so soothed and plumped afterwards. I wish the directions were a little more in-depth on the packaging, I had to do a little digging to find out that you leave the entire pad on the skin like a face mask. The size of the pads themselves are reasonable, I usually use 3 for my whole face with two on my cheeks and one on my forehead covering my eyebrow wrinkles. These would be good for someone whose skin needs some soothing love but doesn't want to commit to an entire face mask.

        "comments": "Let's be real — some exfoliating pads feel like they're trying to fight your skin instead of help it. But not this one. The ANUA Glow Pad is like a smooth operator that gently wipes away dullness without any drama. No harsh tingling, no tightness, no \"uh-oh, I overdid it\" moments. Just clean, calm, and polished skin after one swipe. I use it at night when I want to wake up and pretend I had a full 10 hours of sleep. It's pre-soaked and ready to roll, which makes it perfect for travel, lazy nights, or those \"I can't do a 10-step routine\" days. If your skin is sensitive, textured, or just tired, this is the step that brings the glow without the side-eye. Gentle enough for daily use, but effective enough to notice. Trust me — your skin will thank you.",

        "comments": "I have been using the PDRN 100 Hyaluronic Acid Glow Pad for just a few days and I already really like it. The pads come in a tub. Each pad is soaked in a smooth serum. I take one pad out after cleansing and gently wipe my face with it. The liquid feels cool and moist. I glide the pad around cheeks forehead and chin. It does not feel sticky or oily at all.\n\nAfter the first use my skin felt soft and looked fresh. My face had a faint glow. After a couple of days I saw that dry spots around my nose looked less rough. The glow pad gave a gentle shine that looked natural and healthy. The serum absorbs fast and does not leave any residue. It made my skin feel calm and well hydrated.\n\nEvery morning after my toner and at night after washing I use one pad. It is easy and quick. I like that I can just swipe one pad and feel refreshed. Even under makeup my face felt smooth and happy. In the evening I follow with moisturizer and sleep feeling refreshed in the morning.\n\nI have sensitive skin and had no irritation at all. I did not see redness or pimples. The pad felt soothing and clean. A few people mention a light smell from the pad but I did not notice any scent. The glow pad felt soft on my skin and did not tear or pull.\n\nIn only a few days I felt my skin look more even and feel more supple. My face had a subtle glow that looked like it comes from deep clean hydration. I feel like this is a nice simple step in my skin routine if you want skin that looks lively and feels soft. I will keep using it and see how skin looks in one week.\n\nThis product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review.",

        "comments": "As someone who prefers toner pads over liquid toner, I like seeing this concept for what I might consider an essence. It screams hygienic and clean to me. I'm still on fence on how I feel about the formula though, as it's quite different from the other ones I've tried.\n\n🫐 I wanted to love this but something about the texture felt so goopy to me that I almost didn't want to use it. I guess it's supposed to provide more than your standard dose of hydration, but for something that is supposed to gently exfoliate, it kind of felt too thick. \n\n🫐 I use this after cleansing and before applying moisturizer. Usually, right after the toner step, I go straight ahead and apply moisturizer without waiting. For this one though, I felt that I had to wait a little (around 10 minutes) post pad removal to let it fully absorb before I could go onto my moisturizer step. \n\n🫐 The packaging for this leaked everywhere for me once I removed the seal. You need it upright at all times, and if you hold it at an angle for even  a second, serum will leak out of the box. I wasn't a fan of this because as I was trying to move it around, liquid was slightly spilling out of the lid.\n\n🫐 Formula wise, while it does take a bit to absorb, it does give a long lasting moisture that lasts for at least a day. I liked how glowy my skin looked and how easy it was to apply makeup the following day. It contains sodium based PDRN, which is great for all skin types, including sensitive ones. For context, I have combination skin that leans oily.\n\n🫐 This is alcohol-free, fragrance-free, and essential oil-free formula. It didn't cause me to break out, nor did my pores feel like they were being congested. \n\n*I received this complimentary in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts are my own.",
