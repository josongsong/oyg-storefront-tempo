I have been using this eye cream for 4 months and have already seen a difference. My eyes don't look as tired anymore (nursing student, get zero sleep) my fine lines on outer bottom eye have essentially disappeared and my dark circles have brightened up, plus they are very well hydrated. I can go without concealer and not look like a character from the Walking Dead. It's not a quick fix for anyone who thinks you will be cured of eyebags within a month or 2 or even 4 months as it did for me. Everyone's body chemistry is different and will take different lengths of time for noticeable change. I have dry skin and I am 24 years old.",

I am using it nightly, and applying it with a Clarisonic Opal, but have not seen any \"visible results\" after about 3 weeks of use.  I will continue to use it as I know getting in the habit of a nightly eye cream is a good habit.  However after I run out, I might move onto a different cream, if those 'visible results' don't start to show soon.",
