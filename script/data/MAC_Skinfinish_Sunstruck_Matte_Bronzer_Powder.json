I have had to scrape the top part with a spoon countless times. I'm finally returning it because it is a huge waste of money once it hits hard pan it doesn't even work. It's really frustrating because it is a beautiful color and a beautiful formula when freah but unfortunately I suppose with my face routine, it doesn't fit in.",

It lasts a really long time, has a good formula, and I like the color. The only thing is that you need to put a lot on if you want it to show and it is hard to get the right amount on you at first! Still, I really like this bronzer and can't find another one with the same or really similar color that is better.",

        "comments": "I bought this because my previous \"radiant matte bronzing powder\" was discontinued. This product is more expensive, smaller, and smells terrible. The compact also feels very cheap compared to my old one. The color is very similar, which is the only good thing I have to say. \n\nThe price I can understand since it's taken so long to get through my previous bronzer, but the smell is inexcusable. I don't know if it's the product itself or if the product absorbed the smell of the cheaper plastic but it is really foul. The smell does seem to get better after a bit, but it doesn't make me want to put the product on my face at all. My previous MAC bronzer basically had no smell at all.",
