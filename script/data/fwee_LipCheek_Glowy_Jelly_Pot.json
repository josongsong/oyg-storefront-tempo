It blends easily, giving a luscious glowy appearance on lips and a dewy glow when blended upon the skin. It has a slight cherry aroma. Initially jelly upon application, it does dry down but still has a slightly tacky, but not quite sticky finish. No issues with hair sticking. It's a beautiful flushed color, perfect for those sun kissed looks.",

For reference, I am a light medium/medium neutral olive. The color lavender whip did not show up on my face, and is too pale for my lips. I think this product makes a great lip gloss but a terrible blush because it is so sheer. The color sweets works as a blush and lip gloss but I need to put on several layers for the blush to show up. Im sure that if i got darker colors, i would need to put less layers but I am not sure since i only got two colors. On the face, the product is a bit sticky but thats expected for a gloss, but on the lips it feels very moisturizing. Overall i will keep the sweets color but probably either return the lavender whip color or give it to a fair friend.",
