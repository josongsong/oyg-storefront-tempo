I have even tried hydrochloric acid, and didn't have these results. Also learning that this can be used with azelic acid as well as with retinol at night is great to know too! i will definitely be re-purchasing!",

I used it for the first time this morning, and just a few hours later I developed red, painful bumps all over my neck — exactly where I had sprayed it. The reaction came on quickly and felt more like burning/pain than itching.\n\nMy skin is usually pretty tolerant and I've used other products with similar ingredients without issue, so I was surprised. After checking the label, I suspect it may have been the combination of lactic acid, ferments, and preservatives that triggered the irritation. The fact that it's a spray probably didn't help, since it spread over a sensitive area of my skin. I would not recommend.",

The quality of the bottle is top-notch, it feels sturdy and well-made, like it's going to last a long time. \n\nThe aesthetic of the bottle is just as impressive. It's sleek, modern, and has a certain elegance to it that makes it a beautiful addition to my vanity. It's not just a facial mist, it's a piece of decor!\n\nBut let's talk about the spray, because that's where the magic really happens. It's got a wide range, covering my face evenly with just a couple of spritzes. It's like a gentle, refreshing cloud that wakes up my skin and my senses. It has lasted me a long time. Also, it smells amazing. \n\nAnd the best part? It's such great value for money. It's not often you find a product that's high quality, looks good, and is priced just right. The Byoma facial mist is something I'm really glad I found. \n\nWith all that being said...\nGO BUY IT!\n\nP.S. I said read first before purchasing at the beginning so you would realize how good your decision was :)",

Unfortunately, I personally experienced breakouts from this product. I wouldn't fault it since I know I have sensitive skin, but there are plenty of products I've used on my skin that I haven't broken out from ... overall, I want to love it, and I almost wanna keep using it regardless of the breakouts, because it's so satisfying and fun to spray on, but I don't think I'd be doing myself any favors. But again, that might just be my skin, so I'd still rate the product well, as it feels nice, applies well, and did feel good on my skin before the breakouts. But then the breakouts were those painful deep under the skin ones, even on my neck too, bc I sprayed a bit there too. Too bad :(",

After I wash my face with water and Pat my skin dry I spray my face with this awesome tone mist. My skin feels so restored renewed and rebalanced. Another thing that really caught my attention is that it has no fragrance so that means no extra ingredients that cause irritation due to sensitive skin. Just make sure you follow the directions properly cleanse your face shake Miss bottle well, mist want to clean dry skin and make sure you use it as a daily regimen. I've been using this everyday and my skin has been more clear and feels more soft and natural.",

I expected this to perform like a typical toner—leaving my skin with a refreshed feeling. This was not my experience. \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy a fragrance free facial mist/toner, this could be for you. I applied as directed, shaking well, misting it, after cleansing my skin in the morning. I found it kind of sprayed in a relatively uniform single stream, therefore I wasn't able to get anything close to an aerosol mist. The product applicator could be better to create a mist. \r\n\r\nI eventually found that I prefer to apply this via spraying into my hands and dabbing it onto my face. Unfortunately, this also left my skin feeling super tacky, every time. My skin never had a cooling, refreshed sensation that I have had with a typical rose water toner. I love the idea of this, but the product didn't perform. I was at least looking for the refreshing sensation and it didn't happen! The tackiness also took at least ten minutes to go away. I didn't experience any breakouts or irritation on the bright side. This did not live up to my expectations unfortunately.",
