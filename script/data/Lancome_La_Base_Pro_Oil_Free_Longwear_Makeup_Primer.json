After using it and visiting a friend she said my skin was glowing ;) and we visit often with each other meaning she saw me days before,\r\nThe way I?m apolying this is after shower or face wash, tone, acne medicine roll on (a must!) I? apply my visionaire skin corrector (you gotta get that magic!) then apply this with my finger over my t-zone area, especially in the deep poor areas of my face, due to a few chicken pox scars it?s a must and pores around my nose become invisible. Gone! Buh bye. \r\nAfter applying is when I?ll put my make up in order on counter just to let it set some. Doesn?t need it really, just my preference. I?ll even just smooth it once more on my face with clean hands. I?m not using a makeup sponge or anything of the kind, just don?t want to waste this magic \r\nIt?s smooth application, no obvious scent and not greasy. In fact I?m sure it smooths out my face along with keeping foundation looking picture perfect. \r\nill try to upload a recent picture. I?m 50. Have had NO surgery or anything else. Just have kept out of the sun, see my dermatologist every couple years and using Lancome products exclusively for nearly 30 years. ONLY skin care line that doesn?t EVER break my face out,",
