I love using this for work in the early morning as I don't have more than 10 minutes to do my makeup.  It looks beautiful on the skin.  The problem?  It oxidizes like 2-3 shades darker.  I had tried shade #3, and exchanged it for shade #2 which seemed to help but still looks very dark.  Sadly I will be returning more than likely.  I wish they could come out with lighter shades!  If you a very fair skin girly (I'm N4 with MAC) I would steer clear because this will have your face looking 2-3 shades darker than you are.",

It's light weight on your skin and doesn't fall into lines or wrinkles and helps to hide pores. I use primer first apply the foundation and then the Mineral Veil. Looks as good at the end of the day as when I put it on in the morning. I also like the ability to be able to mix colors if I want a little more color on my face in the summer.",

So I decided to try the matte version. The colors are slightly darker than the orginal. Coverage is much more sheer so I feel I would use a jar of this up much faster needing to use more to get the coverage I like. Felt heavy on my skin and my skin also felt tight. Did like the finish it left but after using this for a month or so it broke my skin out very bad. Pimples and lots of redness like my skin was burned. I will be going back to the original and will never ever put this version near my skin again. So if your skin is sensitve I woul be very careful about this matte version.",
