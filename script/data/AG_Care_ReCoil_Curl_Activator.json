Though I can see why people complain about their hair being too crunchy. Truthfully, I don't mind crunchy hair and day one because it maintains my curls well and it looks better throughout the week. I also find it really easy to refresh my hair, but if you want something with a light hold, this product isn't for you. I really recommend this for people who are prone to frizzy hair and need a really strong hold.",

I like it best on wet but not soaking wet hair, raked through in sections and then brush styled through everything to make sure it is evenly distributed. I'll try different products and I always come back to this. It doesn't give a super strong hold so I like to pair it with their mousse gel after I plop my hair to get all of the extra water out before diffusing. I've even gotten several of my curly haired friends to try this and they love it too.",

I have 3a/3b curls, and my hair is long, very thick, and coarse. I never blow dry and rarely use any heated styling tools. My curls typically look good on wash day but once I sleep on my hair or run my fingers through or brush it, I lose a lot of the curl and it ends up looking....meh.  I have been looking for years for a product that will retain my curls without making my hair sticky or hard, and this is it!! I find it works best when I apply it right out of the shower, when my hair is still pretty wet.  I have a lot of hair but I would say I use about a quarter-size dollop, maybe a smidgen more. My hair is pretty heavy so I will flip my head upside-down and scrunch up the curls 3-4 times while it's air-drying, this gives me a tighter curl and also helps break up the crunchy cast. My day 2 is now full of gorgeous curls, soft but still well-defined. The curls hold up well in the heat and humidity too. This is a holy grail product for me, I will absolutely be purchasing it again (and again)!",

The Ulta in their area didn't carry my other curly hair products so I purchased the AG line and I was really disappointed. I used this product on refresh day and wash day and the results were different. On refresh day with a bit of water to my hair, this product gave my hair the curl control that I needed. However, the next day was wash day and when I applied this to my hair, and after it dried, there was a visible white cast that turned into dandruff like flakes from the product. The flakes were excessive and when I tried to rinse out the areas that had a white cast, it only made the flakes worse making you look unhygienic. I returned the product within 3 days of purchase. I wouldn't recommend it.",
