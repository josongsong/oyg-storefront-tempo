It's a gorgeous shade, it blends out really well, it's very creamy and soft to the touch, it's very matte on the skin but doesn't cling to any dry patches. The one thing I would change is that the shade is just a touch too warm for my skin. It's supposed to be neutral, but it's just a little bit too orange. It's nothing bad though, and I think it's mostly just my own undertones being so cool. Either way, I would absolutely buy this again because it's a wonderful product and the shade is only a tad off, not that noticeable. Packaging also feels nice and luxurious.",
