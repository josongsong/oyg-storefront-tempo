Outline the upper arch and blend using a spoolie brush. To add detail and dimension, add hairlike strokes to the front of the brow. With the tip of the pencil, lightly sketch in the same direction as the hair's natural growth. Use this technique on sparse areas throughout the brow and blend using a spoolie brush for a natural finish. Remember that all ABH products are highly pigmented, so little pressure is required when applying.PRO TIPS·When preparing to fill in the brow, use Brow Wiz in a shade lighter than your natural hair color to map out the three points of the Golden Ratio along the brow to serve as guide points.·When detailing the brow, always apply Brow Wiz in the same direction as the hair's natural growth. Use light pressure when applying.·To achieve the hair-stroke technique, hold Brow Wiz at a slant, lightly place the tip of the pencil onto the brow area, apply pressure at the bottom and then flick your wrist. This creates a follicle effect at the base.·Layer different shades of ABH brow products to create natural-looking multidimensional brows. First, fill in the brow with a lighter shade of Brow Powder Duo using Brush 7B. Then, detail the brow with tiny hairlike strokes using a darker shade of Brow Wiz.·For a quick application, first outline the shape of the brow (top and bottom), then blend the product through the brow using a spoolie brush. Warm up the fine-tipped pencil on the back of your hand; this allows for a creamy application. Use the hair-stroke technique to complete the brow look.IngredientsHydrogenated Soybean Oil, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Zinc Stearate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Cera Carnauba/Cire De Carnauba, Stearic Acid, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, May Contain/Peut Contenir (+/-): Mica, Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)Shipping & Coupon RestrictionsThis brand is excluded from most Ulta Beauty coupons.See brand eligibility details",
