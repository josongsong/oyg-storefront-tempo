        "comments": "Absolutely love this flat iron.  But for the price, this item was not worth the expense, due to it's short life span.  The flat irom was always allowed to cool on the counter after use. It was not used a daily. To store it, I would roll the cord and lay it flat on the floor of the cabinet.  Not sure why it didn't last, but since it gave out quickly, I'm not feeling like its a worthy investment.",

I liked it because it cut down on time I  take to straighten my hair since its 1 1/2 \" thick but I then noticed it damges your hair even while I apply heat protector. If you prep your hair it will make it shinny too.  But it also leaves wavey hair spots no matter how hot I use it or how many times I try to straighten it (I have soft undamaged wavy hair) I want to try a ceramic one instead for less damage. I feel like this one will soon thin out my hair with continued use😔 it also seems like if I drop it it will break easily as other reviews stated.",

This BaByliss straightner heats up very quickly and works perfect, on the middle heat selection (375 degrees), for my curly hair. My hair glides through the plates smoothly, with no pulling or snagging, and the plates are the perfect size for great coverage. I've found my new favorite straightner and won't be purchasing any other brand again!",

        "comments": "First of all, I have to say that this is an exceptional straightening iron. It features advanced technology that sets it apart from other straightening irons on the market. The Nano Titanium technology ensures that the iron heats up quickly and evenly, making it easy to straighten even the most stubborn and curly hair.\n\nOne of the things that I love about this straightening iron is that it has vents that help to distribute heat evenly. This is important because it reduces the likelihood of hot spots that can damage hair. Additionally, the vents help to speed up the straightening process, so you can achieve the look you want in less time.\n\nThe straightening plates are also a great feature of this iron. They are made from high-quality materials that glide smoothly through your hair, reducing the risk of snagging and pulling. The plates are also wide enough to handle even thick and curly hair, which is a huge plus.\n\nAnother thing that sets this straightening iron apart is its temperature control. It has a wide range of temperature settings that make it suitable for all hair types, from fine and delicate to thick and coarse. This means that you can find the perfect temperature to achieve the look you want without damaging your hair.\n\nFinally, I have to mention the design of this straightening iron. It is sleek and stylish, with a comfortable grip that makes it easy to use. It is also lightweight, which means that you can use it for extended periods without experiencing fatigue.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend the Nano Titanium Vented Straightening Iron to anyone who is looking for a high-quality straightening iron that delivers exceptional results. Its advanced technology, wide temperature range, and comfortable design make it one of the best straightening irons on the market.",

        "comments": "Disclaimer: I received this item for free and in return I am supplying an honest review. I'm so disappointed in this product. I really wanted to love it! There are a few good things....the packaging is great, the 360 degree 9 foot swivel cord and it looks nice and feels nice in my hand. The cons far outweigh those items. First, there is no indicator that it is ready to use. No beeping sound or color change. You just have to wing it. I also don't like the limited heat settings. It's supposed to be for dry or damp hair but there is nothing about that in the directions. My current straightener is a dual one as well and the heat setting vary based on if your hair is dry or damp. I tried this one with damp hair and the setting I use while it's dry seemed way too hot. For the price of this I expected it to be better than my current one that cost 5 times less than this one. I found myself wanting to use my old one instead....Disappointed overall in this straightener.",
