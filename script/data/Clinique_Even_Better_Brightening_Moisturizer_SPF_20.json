It isn't going to get rid of my hyper pigmentation permanently, but as long as I use this it drastically lightens it to almost being unnoticeable. That is a win in my book.  Plus it has SPF and doesn't feel like other products I tried with SPF, that don't blend in well, are thick, and leave you feeling oily.",

The scar is still visible but not much darker from when I first started using this moisturizer. What got my attention was a few days ago I noticed that my right hand was getting the dreaded age spots. But my left hand had only one very faint spot. I wondered what I might be doing to cause this-I then realized that after I put my Even Better Moisturizer on my face-with my right hand-I would rub the excess on the top of my left hand. I don't know if it is the sunscreen in this product or the moisturizer itself but I can now see that this stuff really works. I don't usually write reviews about a product I use but I just had to share this.",

My skin scars extremely easily and I've battled with acne scars for years. I've tried other blemish removers and nothing has worked as well as this product. \n\nI use it every morning as soon as I get up, wait a few minutes and then apply makeup as usual. Over the last couple months I've noticed I don't need as much concealer, and what would be new scars are fading away almost as soon as they happen. I'm not extremely into makeup-I use it mostly as cover up-and this product is giving me some confidence back with my clearer skin.",
