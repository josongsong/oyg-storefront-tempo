My makeup came off effortlessly, and it didn't leave a greasy residue. The only potential concern is that if you wear contact lenses, it may cause your eyes to blur. Therefore, it's advisable to remove your contact lenses before using the product. I would otherwise recommend and already have recommended the product.",

        "comments": "It's a nice, light-weight product with a pleasant texture and scent that feels clean (of toxins) and refreshing on the skin. The consistency of the foam was gentle on my skin, but acted strong enough to remove dirt and oil off my face.  My skin leans on the oily side, but can easily dry-out from harsh cleansers and my skin felt very balanced after using this product, although it wasn't necessarily glowing.  Also, the foam was a little stubborn to wash away with just my hands & water and I needed a washcloth to remove all of the cleanser from my skin.",
