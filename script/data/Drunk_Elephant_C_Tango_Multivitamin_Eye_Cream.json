I do react to a lot but my skin usually loves vit C products, and Beste cleanser is one of my favs. I've used other DE products like protini and didn't like them enough to repurchase but didn't have a reaction. I haven't tried babyfacial and some stronger actives, exfoliants are rarely hits with me and usually misses. Vitamin C though, all my dark spots fade (for the period I'm using it), my skin glows, for every vit C product I've tried. This, my skin is so itchy and hot and dry and red and greasy, my pores huge. I can't believe how prickly and itchy.",

My dark circles are now a baby pink which is good for my eyes, my lids and the fine skin under my eyes is actually noticeably tightened/lifted & moisturized! The lotion goes into the skin & doesn't just sit on top! The price doesn't bother me as I have spent a good amount of $ on eye products that are bogous and this product is definitely quality, worth the price to me! P.s.- i have sensitive eyes and this product didn't irrate my skin!! My results were literally same day, i put this on 3 hours ago & my eyes look completely different!! I cant wait to see if my results improve or at least stay consistent throughout use!",

        "comments": "TW assault    A few months ago I was involved in a terrifying assault that left me with a swollen black eye. Every time I looked in the mirror I broke down and the constant reminder on my face upset me. I had a little sample of this product from one of the packs so I started using it 2 days after the attack after the swelling subsided. This product helped me look in the mirror again. I used it constantly and massaged it in. My black eye and bruising went away in 1 week. I know black eyes take 2 or more and with the deep red and purple, I didn't expect to see the fade and results so quickly. Thank you Drunk Elephant.",

        "comments": "I have finished the full sized version of the cream after about 3 months of applying it every night before bed. I bought this, as I have these ungodly dark circles under my eyes for someone in their early 20s. For that use, I am not… impressed. Because these changes are so hard to see when you look in the mirror everyday, I ended up trying to consistently take weekly photos of my face to try and document any changes. After reviewing them, and how the product makes me ultimately feel, this is where I landed:     Did it make my eyes feel hydrated? Yes!     Did it brighten my eyes? Kind of; it did, but I expected a bit more after hashing out $65, and all the hype around it.     Did it help my dark circles? Again, kind of (emphasis on kind of), but was expecting more.     I also noticed that the product did in fact have a *minor* burn when you get a smidge too close to your eye. User error? Definitely, but something to note if you have sensitive eyes, which mine are most certainly not.     I ended up purchasing some Peter Thomas Roth eye patches to use in conjunction about halfway through the bottle, and felt like both these products combined did a really good job. I felt like they both complimented each other, and helped enhance this creams effects a lot more. However, once again, this cream on its own, I was not super impressed.     Overall, I think this product needs a bit more work with the potency; I wouldn't mind spending more, but if this is the baseline I'm not enamored to continue purchasing it. The product had a lot of hype; I think it would be good for someone looking to add just a bit of brighten to their eyes and some good moisture, however, my dark circle girlies will need to carry on elsewhere.",
