This has no oil in it, so it won't be effective if you apply it directly to a dry face. But it doesn't leave an oily residue which makes your eyemakeup run the next day.",

First when I received it, the white tab you're supposed to pull off was so small and would not come off so I had to poke a hole into it to get the product out. I put it on a cotton pad and gently wiped my eye makeup off. I noticed I really had to rub for it to even start coming off which really defeats the purpose. Which, I tried two different mascaras- one waterproof it definitely has a difficult time coming off and regular - same just not as tough. Then the dry down just felt like it was so try. My dry eyes were even more dry. With the cost of this product I would honestly expect better. It's almost like a higher class micellar water. After this product, I am done purchasing this brand. I will find Clarins, which works so much better. I just wish Ulta would carry it!",

For my birthday, I applied another pair of strip lashes on top...for more dramatics *sigh*. My eyelash glue and whatever the nail salon used fused together and I could not get the lashes off. Coconut oil, steam, etc were not working. I went to my product stash and could not believe I forgot about this. I gently rubbed this around the brim of my eyelids and the lashes (both sets) loosened right up and slid off without any further pulling. Grateful for this product and more proof it is doing it's job to get the cakey mess up off our skin.",

This remover while gentle does the job with just a few easy swipes of a cotton ball or remover pad. It's easy on my eyes and doesn't cause any burning or tearing up. I am 57. I was in the hospital recently for 15 days, wearing no makeup. The nursing staff was amazed to learn my age. We'd gotten to be friendly and it was their concences that I was 41! Thank you Estée Lauder.",

After soaking two cotton balls PER EYE with the solution and holding to my eye for a few seconds before I started rubbing, my mascara (not waterproof) and eye liner (also not waterproof) just barely came off. I had to use my Purity cleanser to get all of the eye make up off. I am returning this product.",
