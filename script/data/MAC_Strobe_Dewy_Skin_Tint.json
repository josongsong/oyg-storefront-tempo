I tried it over three different moisturizers and got the same results. I even tried it on my bare skin. Also, it has an almost cartoonish shine to it. I just turned 60, so maybe it is not meant for mature skin. \nI have a lot of Mac products.  I think their paint pots are amazing. In my opinion,  Mac really missed the mark on this one.",

        "comments": "One thing about me? I love tinted moisturizers. They are the linchpin to my skincare routine and the only real \"makeup\" product I use on a daily basis. So when I was offered the opportunity to review this product as part of a free sample program, I jumped on it. \n\nThe instructions say to apply with fingertips, which is how I usually apply my tinted moisturizers, so when it arrived I dove right in and started applying after the rest of my skincare had been completed. The first thing you notice about this product is just how thique it is - almost like a water mixed clay. \n\nBecause of its consistency, I found it was a bit reluctant to move/blend on the skin - a blessing for lasting power, a curse for application. I've watched several video reviews of the product since my first demo, and they all recommended using brushes for application, a sentiment I echo wholeheartedly. \n\nUpon first application I was not very impressed. There was an orange hue that I had trouble blending into my skin tone,  and the way it interacted with my UV protecting primer created a whitecast that I've never experienced before. This made the shine look artificial as if it were sitting on top of my skin, rather than a natural part of my complexion. \n\nWhat I'll say about this product in general is that the dry down is key. Even after days of use, during which I felt I had gotten a better handle on how to apply the product, I felt dissatisfied with how I looked immediately after application. But 30 minutes after, once the product had dried? My skin was beautiful. And it stayed that way for the rest of the day - through naps, long walks in dry heat, all the way through my nighttime skincare routine. I was impressed by the staying power and the increasingly natural look it provided. \n\nIt took a while for this product to grow on me, but once you learn how to use it. May not be as \"easy\" as other products, but worth the money if you have the time (and a brush).",

It is really pretty from afar, but when you get even a little close it looks a little greasy and too shiny. If you like that look but don't want too much glitter/shimmer, then this is the right product for you. I tried putting my regular foundation on top but you could still see the effect of the tint, so I wouldn't recommend layering with this either if you intend to try to layer this to have a softer effect. I did try to powder and it did help and gave me that soft, glow-from-within look I wanted, but it quickly got cakey and then you could really see all my pores. I also found this tint to have some transfer and stickiness, as expected from a skin tint. This is also a little heavier than I expected from a tint so it had some decent coverage and was layerable. TLDR; if you want to glow and shine and want the skincare benefits of a tint with the coverage of a buildable foundation, get this! If you don't want to have too much shine or want something lightweight and/or transfer-proof, I would pass on this product.",
