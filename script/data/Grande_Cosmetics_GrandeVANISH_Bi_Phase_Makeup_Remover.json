Alas, associate discounts stopped for online purchases which leaves me to join a journey for another substitute in store. Would reccomend every online shopper to purchase and I wish for the possibility of the item to become added in line (for us to sell) in the future🙏🏼♥️",

Ive tried a few different removers, with my most recent favorite being a homemade remover (kinda scary, I know). Then I saw the reviews for this and figured might as well try it. Holy crap, its fantastic!!! I absolutely hate the way most makeup removers make my eyes sting, how much I lose lashes, and it feels like I can never truly get all the makeup off. This stuff works like a charm, even on my waterproof/stubborn makeup. I dont know if \"cushiony\" is the right word, but it feels right. Theres something about this formula that is just so soothing. Im sold. Worth. Every. Penny.",

I've tried so many makeup removers and this is the only one that doesn't feel greasy on my skin afterwards. I've recently been on a lash journey and trying to grow my lashes out and this product did not mess with them at all. It removed my mascara without pulling or damaging my eyelashes! It also made my skin feel super hydrated and nourished afterwards which is super rare, and I think it's because it doesn't contain any alcohol. If you're on the hunt for a makeup remover that actually works, this is the one! 10/10 recommend!\nGifted by Grande Cosmetics",

I've tried so many makeup removers and this is the only one that doesn't feel greasy on my skin afterwards. I've recently been on a lash journey and trying to grow my lashes out and this product did not mess with them at all. It removed my mascara without pulling or damaging my eyelashes! It also made my skin feel super hydrated and nourished afterwards which is super rare, and I think it's because it doesn't contain any alcohol. If you're on the hunt for a makeup remover that actually works, this is the one! 10/10 recommend!\nGifted by Grande Cosmetics",
