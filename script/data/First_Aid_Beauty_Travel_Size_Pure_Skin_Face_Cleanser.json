I have more than two seconds between patting my face dry with a towel before it starts to feel stretched and parched before I can even reach for my moisturizer. I'm never going to leave my face cleanser ever again. I plan on proposing next month.",

I bought a new bottle, it now says Pure Skin on it but the ingredients are the same. I noticed the consistency is a little more whipped. I used it and the next day my face felt like it had a chemical burn. I returned it the next day and bought a different bottle thinking I ended up with a defective bottle. I washed with it and ended up with same deep irritated burning. I had a quarter left in one of my older bottles and experienced no irritation at all. It looks like the product is now a lot more potent. I can tell because it really removes the dead skin...so perhaps theres more allantoin in it? It also produces more foam than before. This was the only cleanser I could use and it made my skin so amazing. I am so disappointed as it seems as though I cannot use it anymore. I am getting tired of companies always changing and strenghtening their products when there is nothing to be fixed.",
