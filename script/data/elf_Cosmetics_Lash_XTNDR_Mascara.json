I wore a full face of makeup and this was the only product that held up the entire time. Four hours of sweating and taking my head on and off throughout. Everything else wore off, but this mascara held up without a streak or flake. I would highly recommend this mascara to anyone, but especially anyone that has to do rigorous activity and has to look fierce afterwards! I've also wore it swimming with the same result! Better than blinc and less than half the price!",

        "comments": "This is such a good tubing mascara!! The price is great and so is the wear. Since I've been trying/using different mascaras since I was a preteen and have always had most products smudge or flake on me. It's gives me super beautiful length and a ~hint~ of volume. The black is black and the brown isn't visibly very brown, more natural and lighter looking than the pitch black, love both colors. I typically have a little bit of oliy eyelids so most traditional mascara smudge above and below my lashes, especially if im exercising or if it's hot summer weather. THIS! This tubing mascara does NOT smudge or flake the whole day! I've only tried this tubing mascara, but I'd say this formula isn't super wet and gets a lil dryer but not much, its a good middle ground. To remove the mascara I've learned to really make sure to FULLY cover my lashes with water and give it a minute to completely soften, then it slides off easily! It has really helped my lashes to fall out less compared to non tubing. The only downside is if you want your mascara to keep a curl realllyyy good. It's ok but not great for holding a curl (trick is to GENTTLLY use your curler after its dried ;) ) I would absolutely buy this again! Highly highly recommend if you've been wanting to try a tubing mascara!",

        "comments": "This is such a good tubing mascara!! The price is great and so is the wear. Since I've been trying/using different mascaras since I was a preteen and have always had most products smudge or flake on me. It's gives me super beautiful length and a ~hint~ of volume. The black is black and the brown isn't visibly very brown, more natural and lighter looking than the pitch black, love both colors. I typically have a little bit of oliy eyelids so most traditional mascara smudge above and below my lashes, especially if im exercising or if it's hot summer weather. THIS! This tubing mascara does NOT smudge or flake the whole day! I've only tried this tubing mascara, but I'd say this formula isn't super wet and gets a lil dryer but not much, its a good middle ground. To remove the mascara I've learned to really make sure to FULLY cover my lashes with water and give it a minute to completely soften, then it slides off easily! It has really helped my lashes to fall out less compared to non tubing. The only downside is if you want your mascara to keep a curl realllyyy good. It's ok but not great for holding a curl (trick is to GENTTLLY use your curler after its dried ;) ) I would absolutely buy this again! Highly highly recommend if you've been wanting to try a tubing mascara!",

        "comments": "I recognize that different things work for different people, but I am baffled how this would work well for anyone. I've tried at least 6 tubing mascaras at different price points, and this is the worst by a mile. This flaked on me from the first use. I cant get my eyelashes as long or full as other tubing mascaras before they get clumpy. I have naturally curly lashes that I never have to curl, and this actually straightened my lashes. I only saw a minor improvement in how they held a curl after curling them and doing a bunch of tricks I got from people with straight lashes. I even tried using a couple different styles of wands to no avail. The top of the tube was completley gunky with partially-dried mascara after just a few uses. I had to clean it off ao I didnt get chunks on the wand. This is only managing a second star because it didn't run or melt in extreme heat and humidity, but was still quick to remove — which I can't say for some other tubing mascaras.",
