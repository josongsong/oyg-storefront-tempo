The directions have no specified time so you have no idea how long to leave it on and honestly any product that has actual active ingredients is gunna tell you to patch test and remove the product after a certain amount of time.  This product does neither.  I was thinking this might be like a stretchy gauze stip kinda like some of the neck masks out there.  I have only used a few times but I have seen any results.
