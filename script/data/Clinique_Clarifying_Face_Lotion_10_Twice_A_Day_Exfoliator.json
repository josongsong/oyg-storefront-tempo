And then I stopped using it. But my mature skin still needs the cell turnover that creates bright and soft looking skin. And this alcohol free version is fantastic. It gives my skin a very clean look and after 2 weeks of once daily use I looked younger. Yeah!! Twice a week I replace it with the Clarifying do-over peel. That's another great product to promote cell turnover and create beautiful skin.",

My skin has gotten to the point that it was screaming it needs help exfoliating. The Clinique consultant at Ulta recommended me this product, and with it being 50% off at the time I decided to give it a go. It's amazing! It's SUPER gentle, non-drying, and doesn't make my skin feel right afterwards at all. No burning whatsoever, it just feels like water honestly. My skin feels super soft after using and looks glowing. I should have bought both bottles! Highly recommend for all my super dry and sensitive skin girlies.",

However, I think the consultant accidentally put a different (stronger) clarifying lotion in the container (or, perhaps it was contaminated in some way since it came from the counter's sample bottle), because I recently purchased a brand new bottle from the store (thinking I'd give it another try), and so far I have had no problems with it whatsoever. It seems very gentle and mild with no noticeable smell. I have very sensitive rosacea-prone skin, and I have experienced NO redness, itching, dryness or irritation. In fact, my skin feels soft, hydrated, and it actually has a glow to it. All I've been using is the extra mild cleanser, the 1.0 exfoliator, and the Dramatically Different cream in the jar twice a day. I'm so glad I gave this product another chance!. If Clinique does decide to bring back the old version of this product due to customer demand, I hope they will continue making this version as well for those of us who now don't want to be without it.",

But just in case Clinique reads this review, I want them to know that the previous mild lotion was the only product I ever found that completely cleared up my acne and gave me great skin. For seven years, it was the magic bullet in my skin routine. Instead of curing my acne, this new lotion makes me break out. To say I'm disappointed is an extreme understatement.",
