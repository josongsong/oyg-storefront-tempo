It masks dark circles under the eyes, and also if you have any imperfections, be sure to apply it and it will mask everything as if you have nothing on your face. Doesn't roll or tighten the skin, works all day and looks great. Smells nice and is easy to use thanks to the soft roller on top. Nice price and will suit even the most fastidious.",

It is scent-free and comes in a convenient-sized packaging for throwing in a makeup bag or a pair for on the go! It handles really well on under eye bags and pretty much cancels and blue/purple discoloration (like undereye bags).  The concealer goes on very blendable and dries down nicely for a long-lasting wear. There's a little bit of a learning curve on the first application with the sponge, you don't realize it's saturated until it's too late. But after the first saturation of the applicator,  any to follow is super easy to use! It was easy to match my shade and I could imagine doing a full contoured face with the range of shades available!",

The formula is lightweight but has amazing coverage—it brightens my under-eye area instantly and makes me look more awake without feeling heavy or cakey.\n\nThe sponge applicator is super convenient and blends the product really well, so I don't even need a brush or sponge most days. I love how smooth and natural it looks on the skin—it doesn't settle into fine lines or crease, which has been a problem for me with other concealers.\n\nAnother huge plus is that it lasts all day without needing touch-ups. I can wear it for work, errands, or even a night out, and it still looks fresh hours later. The shade range is great too, so it's easy to find a match or even pick up a lighter shade for brightening.",

        "comments": "[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser Color Correcting Concealer is lightweight, blendable, and does the job without looking cakey. The sponge tip makes application quick and easy, and the formula melts into the skin for a natural finish. It brightens dark circles, tones down redness, and adds just enough coverage for a fresh, awake look. Works well alone for minimal makeup days or under foundation for extra correction. Affordable and effective—definitely a solid drugstore staple.",

The spongy applicator is interesting, but I'm not convinced of its usefulness. It seems to put a lot of product on it, but then you need another sponge without product to blend it out",

Instead of a typical under eye remedy cover ...perhaps I was looking not in the right direction, so-to- speak, but, instead thought a much I needed correctiveness. So, I purchased this product. Rushed home, placed in on my under eyes and wham! Away went the dark holloweness and my tired eyes literally popped with youthfulness! Included a photo for you to see Left eye WITH product/Right eye WITHOUT.  Beyond thrilled with the results ....pure ecstatic happiness! I am 53, blonde hair, light/med peachy pinky  skin tone.",

I bought 3 different cosmetic sharpeners and just when I thought I was making progress, the tip of the eyeliner broke off.  I read every review here when I couldn't figure out how to get more product out.  I followed all the suggestions - this item is going in the trash and I will go back to Ulta Waterproof eyeliner.  Do not waste your money on this product until they make it in a twist holder.",
