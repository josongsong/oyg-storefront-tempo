It's very good to use before a date if you want to have a fresh scent. Then put on your favorite cologne. So, if you haven't used this body wah yet. Give it a try. All Jack Black products do a great job. If you haven't used any. Look at your local store. They're worth your money.",

The smell in the lather is much stronger than what's left on your skin afterward, which is a good thing. The strong hit of  eucalyptus wakes you up, and the soothing aroma of rosemary, citrus, and musk relax your aches and pains away. Love it. Wish the price were a bit more reasonable, but, what can you do.",

I love my Molton Brown body washes for the mornings before work and weekends. But my Jack Black ALL OVER is my closer. Its my after workout wash, weekend morning shower, anytime/go to wash. Its fresh, cooling and gives man that \"I feel great\" sensation. You know what I mean!\n\nI buy this stuff only in the tube because its easy to throw into a gym bag and go. I would consider the big bottle, but I love my Molton Brown and buying this stuff in bulk will only make me use more of it in one session. I dont use a sponge or loofah with this product; I use my bare hands and it really goes on smooth and goes a long way with just a quarter size squeeze at a time. Also, it feels great for that after workout shower; the eucalyptus real cools the skin and makes you feel relaxed but still ready to go.",

A little or a lot serves you the same, so go easy and save your money on product.  Or better yet do not buy this to save more money.  Maybe it's good for sensitive skin as mine feels fine use after use.  Very mild scent, and a good one at that.  It's a decent beard wash and shampoo.  It's not to be a replacement for conditioner.  Although, it is better than JB's shampoo plus conditioner which is not saying much either.  That was a poor performer for my hair, big time.  This was okay if you condition separately.",
