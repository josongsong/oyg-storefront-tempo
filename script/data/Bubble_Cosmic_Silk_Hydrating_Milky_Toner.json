I have sensitive skin and saw people raving and thought to take a chance and try something new. I wish i never did. I wish i could post the pictures in this review of my skin.

        "comments": "Alright, here's a review of Bubble Skincare's Cosmic Silk:\n\nBubble Skincare's Cosmic Silk moisturizer has quickly become a staple in many skincare routines, lauded for its lightweight texture and hydrating properties. Designed to cater to a variety of skin types, including sensitive and acne-prone skin, this moisturizer promises to leave your skin feeling smooth and balanced without clogging pores.\n\nOne of the standout features of Cosmic Silk is its ingredient list. It boasts a blend of skin-loving components like hyaluronic acid, known for its ability to draw moisture into the skin, and squalane, which helps to lock in hydration and support the skin's natural barrier. The inclusion of antioxidants like vitamin E further protects the skin from environmental stressors. Users appreciate that it is free from common irritants such as parabens, sulfates, and artificial fragrances, making it a safe bet for those with sensitive skin.\n\nIn terms of performance, Cosmic Silk lives up to its claims. The texture is indeed silky and absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving behind a soft, matte finish. This makes it an excellent option for daytime use, as it layers well under makeup without causing any unwanted shine or greasiness. Many users have reported a noticeable improvement in their skin's hydration levels and overall radiance after incorporating Cosmic Silk into their daily routine. It's particularly effective for those with combination skin, as it provides enough moisture to keep dry patches at bay while controlling oil production in the T-zone.\n\nFinal answer: Bubble Skincare's Cosmic Silk is a well-formulated moisturizer that delivers on its promises of hydration, balance, and a silky-smooth finish. Its lightweight texture, skin-friendly ingredients, and compatibility with various skin types make it a solid choice for anyone looking to upgrade their skincare routine.",

        "comments": "I have acne prone skin. the most important thing to me with skincare is obviously having products that don't break me out. this product has no scent and doesn't clog my pores, which is great! as for it doing anything? I'm not sure. I have very dewy skin as it is because I use a few, really good products consistently. maybe thats why I couldn't tell if it made a difference or not. would've given 4 stars for the fact that it's lightweight, fragrance free, and doesn't congest my pores BUT the packaging this product is in is terrible. you twist to open it to get product out, but when you twist to close it a bunch of the product shoots out and gets all over the place. this also wastes a lot of product. I've tried closing it slowly and gently shaking it to ensure there's no product at the top, but nothing stops the spit out with every single close. for this reason, I won't be re-purchasing. just ok!",
