But they must have changed the formula in the last couple of years. This product now leaves a gross/greasy build-up on my hair after blow drying and styling with other tools. I don't use any other products and haven't changed my shampoo/conditioner. This only difference was I buying a new bottle of this. After reading more reviews, I am clearly not the only one who has noticed this. I will definitely not be purchasing this again,",

I have very thick, fairly healthy hair and after applying this product to dry hair and running my flat iron over my hair, the ends literally fried.  This product leaves a sticky, waxy residue.  My flat iron is at 375 degrees, I have tried it on wet and dry hair.  Do not recommend.  I gave it a chance and I fear I have passed the return period.  What a waste of money.",

I used this after using the all soft line of shampoo/conditioner/leave in, and it seems like the perfect combo.",

I was on the hunt for a heat protectant with hold that I could use before I used a waving iron on my hair and this one is perfect! I take my dry hair section by section, mist it lightly and brush the mist through before using the iron and it works beautifully. It gave my hair great shine without being greasy and it allowed me to go longer without washing my hair because the waves held up for days even after sleeping on them. \n\nIf you're looking for a dry heat protectant with hold don't hesitate to try this one!",

Then you can go in with a curler or straightener and it is perfection. 10/10 when used this way",

I saw this at Ulta the other and decided to give it a try.   For reference, my hair is thick, but very very fine and straight.  It is cut in a chin length bob.   I use a large barrel curling iron, the way you use a flat iron.  By  that, I mean I section hair, start at the scalp and pull the iron up the hair section bending slightly as I go.  This gives fullness and a gentle curve, rather than stick straight.  I sprayed each section lightly with this Iron Guard Style and Stay spray and then curled as usual.   It is fantastic!   Gave me huge, fluffy volume with no stickiness and the volume lasted all day!   Sometimes I finish with a little Chi Infra Texture just to keep stubborn pieces in place, but in terms of the sheer volume...I haven't used anything that comes close!    Again...I can not speak for thick or curly hair but for fine hair that needs volume and is styled with a heated styling tool, I whole heartedly suggest giving this one a try.  I continue using the other heat protectant all over my damp hair before blow drying though, because hair as fine as mine needs protection for drying AND styling.",

        "comments": "I had high hopes for this heat protection spray, as I've used other Chi products and loved them. The first few times I used this, I was super happy because it smelled *amazing* and made my hair shiny. But, over the next few uses, I noticed my hair was going from silky (right out of bed - tangle free!) to dry, rough, and tangly immediately after straightening. I was confused because A) I was using a heat protector and B) it was instantaneous \"damage\" following the use of heat tools, and went away after washing. \n\nThe product sprays on like a protecting wax, very sticky and heavy; You need to brush through it a few times after spraying before you can even think about taking a hot tool to it. I will say my hair is undamaged while using it, but it makes my hair tacky, while causing dryness and matting tangles.",
