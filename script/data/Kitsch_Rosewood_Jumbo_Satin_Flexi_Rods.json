I usually wrap my wettish hair into a bun to straighten it and avoid frizz.  That works well.  But these satin rollers took my look to a higher level.  I can use just 4 of them or all 6 of them for different looks. I can roll forward or backward or sideways to change the look. My hair is dry by morning and has amazing controlled curl and founce when I walk.  They are cushioned inside, so easy to sleep on them. I am so glad I found these!",

You'd have to roll the hair super tight and that will only cause tension damage and discomfort when sleeping. And after all that, the curls were not great. Very loose and only at the bottom. The idea to do this in satin was good in theory but in reality just doesn't work well for this technique. I'm sure the others work fine but this was not it. You're better off giving the other ones a try.",

I don't get the reviews here because its actually a great product. Girls at work think i actually spend time doing my curls. People that dont know me think i have natural curls. I have indian hair that is a bit frizzy, slightly wavy in some areas. Its thinning now but its a okay amount and up to my elbows. I think to use this, you really need to develop a technique. I was using socks before this lol so i already had it figured out. If you part your hair in three sections this will be very usuable and you will be able to confotably sleep in it. Start with semi damp hair. Then section the crown part of your head - so from you eyebrows arches on both sides going to just right before the highest point of your head. Brush this section forward. You want to kind or roll your hair all one part of the foam and that to in the center. Hold your hair from the ends tightly and angle a little upwards. Place the roller right on top and try to roll the ends nearly in the center, as you roll the end should wrap in with the hair as you go up. Keep it tight. This the hardest part but easy omce you get the hang of it.Then when you get the the base hold the hair secure on both sides and fold the roller on both side coming to the front of the face so its resting on your forehead. If you did it right it will be secure. Then part remaining hair in two even sections left and right. Comb one section, hold the hair tightly at a bit of an angle and grab the end. For the side you want to roll up diagonally. Roll the end in, hair being rolled on in the center of the roller on itself, continue rolling till you get to the very base of you head and fold the roller on both sides. It should be in like a horseshoe position except ends folded in. It should land slighly above and to the back side of your ears. And thats it. Once you get the hang of it, itll take 10 minutes. Youll wake up with gorgeous curls. I brush them and use a curling mouse in the morning to bounce them. And ill do the same thing the next night to keep them curly.",

        "comments": "Ive been getting a similar for 20 years by winding my hair into a bun, but thought I'd give these a try to see whether it would give me a better or different result. Firstly, I cannot understand why they'd make these out of satin. They're so difficult to put in and then the only way to stop them sliding out of my hair is to roll them super tight (which is painful and I don't want to go bald) or clip them in (which defeats the purpose of using these). I've seen other brands made from cotton and linen, and if I were going to try these again I'd buy those fabrics instead. Secondly, the press studs are impossible to get undone. I'm terrified I'm going to either rip my hair out or rip off a nail every time I tried to open them. In fact, I ripped the top of my nail off opening one tonight, so now I'm in pain and annoyed, which is why I'm leaving the review. I've seen several other brands that have clips (like on bathers) which seem much more practical. Personally I'll be sticking to my bun method, which is much simpler and more comfortable.",
