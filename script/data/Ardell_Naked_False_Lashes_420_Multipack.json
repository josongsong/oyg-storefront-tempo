I've purchased the 420's many times, what I received was was thicker and unnatural looking compared to the thinner wispy originals.

I'm probably the most upset because they did not honor my coupon I originally bought the lashes with, because of their mistake. Wow ulta, just wow.",

If someone wants a more dramatic look I will use the 421s. My favorite for myself is to cut these in half and put them on the outer corners (see pic) \n\n*my only complaint is that there has been a couple of \"bad batches\" that have gone out where the band is very thick and lifts. Do not buy those ones!",
