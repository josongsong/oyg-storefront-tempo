        "comments": "I have developed a extreme dislike for the formulation of  Clinique's 'Almost Lipstick' product. A major con is the pigmentation has significantly diminished. Having purchased it multiple times, I've noticed that each time it resembles Vaseline applied over fading, washed-out lipstick. \n\nOne of my primary concerns with this product is the inefficient tube design, which renders the remaining product unusable when nearing depletion, forcing users to either employ a tool to extract the remaining product or discard the tube with unused product still inside. \n\nConsequently, I firmly believe that the tube's design is flawed and requires revision. I am confident that this will be my final purchase of this lip product.\n\nP Although the color appears beautiful and deceptively pigmented, the reality is that repeated application is necessary to achieve a semblance of color, and even then, it resembles grease over faded lipstick. \n\nTo maintain its reputation as a premier cosmetic brand, Clinique should reconsider this product's formulation and packaging, enhancing the pigmentation and providing a more functional tube design that enables users to utilize the entire product without difficulty. The current design is unbecoming of a well-established brand.",
