When I use the Avene Thermal Spring water spray, my skin clears up and pours nearly disappear. The texture softens and the redness I have goes away. My lips are also baby soft... I can't explain the magic behind it, just that it exists. The results are noticeable within days! I highly recommend this product.",

My skin is very sensitive to friction. Accordingly, wiping my face--for ANY reason--even with this spay and the strongest, softest tissue I can find leaves my face red and irritated. And my skin feels unwashed.    But since I bought it, I didn't want to waste it. So I use it to dampen my hair on post-wash days 1 and often day 2. But that's a very expensive way to dampen hair when a spray bottle of tap water works just as well.    Bottom line: FOR ME, this is purely a luxury item. My skin, though extremely sensitive, can tolerate my municipal tap water. For a person on my budget, tolerant of tap water, purchasing a pricey can of water is nothing less than ridiculous.",
