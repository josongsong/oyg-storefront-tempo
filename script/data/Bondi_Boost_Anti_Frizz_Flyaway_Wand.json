        "comments": "This quickly became my favorite product for taming flyaways and elevating my overall look! I originally wanted to try to have sleeker ponytails but it is so versatile, you can use it with any hairstyle! I loved the ingredient list and how it is cruelty free! Packaging is so important to me and I feel that Bondi Boost made the best decision creating this \"on the go\" style product that you can take in a clutch or purse for quick touch ups. I appreciate the wand and how it tames the flyaways without overcoating my hair and making it look greasy or leaving any residue, no flakes!  The consistency works well on all hair colors without leaving a white cast! I would definitely recommend this product!",
