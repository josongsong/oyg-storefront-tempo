Left natural, it looks like worn out steel wool that has started to unravel, feels like thin straw, and sheds more than my corgi in summer. So naturally, I decided to try to grow it out shoulder length. Normally, I would NEVER spend this much money on a single product, but it is absolutely worth it. This is the only L'Anza product that I use, but it is the best oil on the market and makes a huge difference in y hair.",

This stuff is none of that it's lightweight, smells great, feels super hydrating and doesnt have that oily look on your hair when its dry. I use this with the Oloplex 8 and its the perfect combo for super shiny and hydrated hair plus ive noticed it helps reduce frizz which is a hige plus since i have curly hair so frizz is always a stuggle. If you are looking for a lightwhight oil you can use evey hair wash and actually helps your hair this is it.",

My intention wasnt to use it as a styling product, but rather to apply to my ends at night to keep them hydrated. I was blown away the first time I used this! I've been using the Olaplex bonding oil for over a year now, and this is so much better! It doesn't leave my hair as greasy, but still makes it softer and detangles more, plus the smell is divine. I've swapped the Olaplex oil out for this as the final step in my styling routine. I don't think I'll ever be without this product. Literally my holy grail product!",

This product has smoothed and moisturized my hair like no other. My hair never gets greasy feeling like other products tend to make it feel. I usually use about a quarter sized amount of this oil after towel drying my hair but before drying it. Then, I'll use another dime sized amount before flat ironing or curling since it protects my hair from the heat. I only wash my hair twice a week because it gets so dry and unmanageable if I wash more than that. I use a dime sized amount of this oil every morning on my dry hair before I style it and my hair just soaks it up and gets so soft and smooth. You would think that applying this oil everyday on unwashed hair would result in some seriously weighed down and oil hair...but it doesn't! It just leaves it shiny, full of life and smooth!",
