My only complaint is that sharpening it is VERY difficult because it seems like the pencil is plastic. I debated whether to return it because I love it otherwise and I might just accept that flaw and keep it.",

Rihanna is the reason I jumped into wearing red lipstick back in 2012. She came out with RiRi Woo with Mac and I was hooked. I've also bought her Stunna lip paint and had an obsession with that as well. It's a specific red that I like. It has to have a blue base and she knows how to do it for me. So when I finally got the package and saw it was Fenty I already knew it was going to be for me. The color is BEAUTIFUL. That vivid blue red. When applied it dries down to a powder smudge, kiss proof finish. It's not going anywhere and lasts through out the day. I only wish it was in pencil form as I hate these type of liners. I can never for the life of me get it as sharp as a pencil. It's also a little too soft for my liking. I have to be very light handed when applying because it feels like it will break easily. This will probably be the only color I'll try for those reasons. Had I not received this for free, I would've absolutely bought this color. It's one of my All time favorite reds.",

        "comments": "I really do like it but there are somethings one must keep in mind: 1- It glides on the lips beautifully with no pulling or tugging but at the same time it glides so smooth I find that the formula is almost too soft. You have to apply with light pressure or you can see the tip lean (2) I love it is in a plastic packaging but when it is time to sharpen the plastic gives just a little resistance (3) when sharpening you can never get the tip back to original point. You can still use it but the point doesnt look as \"pretty\". I'm using an elf sharper and it doesn't sharpen well. I'm sharpening too much to try to get an even point. Im going to research to see if the Fenty sharpener is truly made for it. If I want it I have purchase on Fenty website \n\nI have I Woodn't and Brown'd Out and i love the colors. The liner actually sets itself so blend quickly after applying. It has staying power but not to the point of lasting all day or last after eating. You still will have to  reapply. \n\nI like the product but if I can solve  the sharpening issue I would love it.",
