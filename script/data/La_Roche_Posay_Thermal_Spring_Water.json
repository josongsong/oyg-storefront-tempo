I wouldn't say it's \"intensely soothing\" like the description says but definitely medium level assistance. It has even helped me when I've had redness/itching due exposure to an allergen. It reduced the redness and stopped the itching. I wasn't even following directions properly (never patted or wiped the product off). I recommend trying it out.",

It's a great way to refresh throughout the day when you notice your skin needs a bit of boost of hydration. I use it all the time. My morning routine, evening routine and through out the day, especially post workout sessions. Love, love, love it.",

I am in my late 30's and do not have any significant wrinkles and little sun damage. I do however have skin that tends to be sensitive and on the dryer side at times. I use Retin-A 1% cream often in my night routine. So, I like to have sprays around to refresh. Also, for summer usage and purposes. I currently am in summer in a warmer location and this has felt nice. However, there is nothing magic and there are other products that are the same ingredients for less cost. It did not break me out or irritate my skin, which is a plus. If you want to splurge on this then go for it, but to me it just was not worth it. Spring water in a glass spray bottle with a fine mister could do the same.",
