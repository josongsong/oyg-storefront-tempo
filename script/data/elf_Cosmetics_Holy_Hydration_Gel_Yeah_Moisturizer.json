I haven't seen any improvements to this and this is really the only moisturizer I have been using. I felt like over time it made my skin flakey, clogged, and dry. Disappointed, however, the packaging is very nice and the texture of the moisturizer is nice. But I felt like it did nothing.",

This moisturizer feels so good on my combo skin! It makes my skin feel a little bouncy too!   I do top it with a Tatcha cream if I feel especially dry, but this is so good on its own too!",

        "comments": "I reluctantly ordered & used this 'moisturizer' after I realized that the SuperHydrate Gel Moisturizer was discontinued with hopes that it would give me at least similar results. IT HAS NOT. This is the worst e.l.f. moisturizer I've ever used & it looks like I'm not the only one to realize it. I'm 49 with combination skin & the SuperHydrate moisturizer kept my skin glowing & perfectly moisturized all day long. I can't tell you how often I'd get compliments in how bright & glowy my skin was & questions about my regimen. I'm not a product junkie & prefer extremely simplified beauty routines, so I know SuperHydrate played a big part in my skin condition. In the 3 weeks since I started using Gel Yeah, my skin has deteriorated completely. I can literally feel moisture being sucked out of my skin & the feeling of an uncomfortable tightness all over my face. My forehead broke out in tiny, red bumps & all of a sudden I'm seeing these small lines across my forehead that I never noticed before. My skin is no longer smooth & dewy, but appears rough & dry & bumpy to the touch. I included a couple pics but my camera isn't that great, so the change may not seem drastic...but it's definitely evident in person smh. I'm over it & on the hunt for a more reliable moisturizer that actually benefits the skin. Try it at your own risk. To the decision makers at e.l.f., please for the love of all that is HOLY, bring back SuperHydrate in it's most recent formulation.",
