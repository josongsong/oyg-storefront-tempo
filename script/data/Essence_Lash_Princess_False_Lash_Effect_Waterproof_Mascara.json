I have used it for a month so far and my love has only been growing.\nPros:\nDoes not run if my eyes water.\nDoes not burn my eyes.\nMakes my lashes EXTRA SUPER LONG looking.\nStays put on lashes until removed with makeup remover.\nVERY REASONABLE PRICE.\nVERY important to me is that it is cruelty free....ALWAYS a plus.\nI have used all price ranges of mascara from ridiculously expensive to drug store brands. This is the first that has not disappointed.\nThis review WAS NOT PAID FOR. I just love this product.",
