Regardless this is an amazing product. Truly cuts down on blow-dry time. Living in Florida you must have a product with humidity control that really works..",

I use this after I shower and before blow drying on both my real hair and my extensions. I live in South Carolina so humidity resistance is needed. I typically blow out my hair everyday and need something to eliminate the frizz. At first I tried this by just spraying all over, it made my roots decently greasy so I stopped that, but it also did nothing to resist humidity. Next day i tried it again but instead only sprayed it on the midshaft-end, then I added even a little more to my ends for extra protection. Did my blow out, my hair looked great, then I stepped outside and once again, no humidity resistance, 100% frizz instantly. Ive used it for a week now and its the same thing every day. Pro- it does smell good after blow drying and it makes my hair soft. Cons- it smells exactly like antifreeze when blow drying which freaks me out, doesn't eliminate frizz, doesn't resist humidity, and also since using it the ends of my hair look dry and damaged. For the price and what I need it for, it just isnt worth it. Definitely regret this purchase.",
