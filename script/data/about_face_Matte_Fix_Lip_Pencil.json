Unfortunately, it's TOO matte and applies very clumpy- leaving blobs of color that are very VERY hard to blend. Other matte lip pencils I own are not this difficult to use. I used this a few times and then put it aside and forgot about it until recently. Tried it again and the issues persist. I am going to try using it over a layer of lip balm to make it work because I already own it but I would not buy it again and do not recommend it.",

The lid on the pencils closes really tightly, keeping the pencil from drying and opening with a really satisfying pop sound. The pencils are very easy to sharpen (make sure your sharpener isn't dull, y'all), and stick not too tight or too loosely to the lips. Overall, zero regrets, will probably repurchase more.",

And i speak as one of who's lips naturally crease at the corners. At the end of the day i had a tad bit of creasing, after eating, drinking, obsessively wiping my mouth with a napkin (the corners thing) compared to after the first time i take a sip of anything with most other brands. So this is my new favorite thing in the world.",

But once I need to sharpen one of them I have to stick it in the jumbo side of my sharpener & whittle away at it like a darn wood carver & pray I don't waste even more product as it just keeps crumbling & crumbling. I've tried multiple sharpeners. I'm glad I got these through someone's PR box cuz what a waste of product from all these failed attempts at sharpening these liners. About Face...please come out with a sharpener specifically for your lip liners. Cuz I can't find one that it'll fit in. They're just that teeny bit too small just like every gel liner I've tried ( unless it's a mechanical one or whatever they're called & don't need to be sharpened ) *sigh*",
