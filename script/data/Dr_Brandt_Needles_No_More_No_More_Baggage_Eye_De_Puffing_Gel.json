I tried warming it between my fingers as directions state, but if you do that it just rubs into your fingers and there is nothing left for your eyes. Big waste of money for me!",

        "comments": "Basically what this eye cream does is tighten the area underneath your eye and stretch it out, which definitely feels a little weird on my skin, but significantly helped to reduce the bags under my skin. I don't think this is a product meant to for long-term use – it won't help reverse signs of aging – but it will help to lift your eyes temporarily. I would use a different product if you are looking for long-term benefits, but it works for a night out or somerning like that.",

Its great for an evening out.  \nPrior to this product I used Sudden Change. It was harder to apply and if you used to much you got a white film and flakiness. Thats why I prefer the Dr Brandt product. \nSadly ive never been apply to get it to play well with makeup so I dont use makeup under my eyes. The gel has a peachy tint so it looks good with no makeup over it.",

I have tried so many eye creams that promise to make a difference then fail miserably. \nI was skeptical about this eye cream, especially at this high of a price point, but I had heard really good things about it. I finally purchased it a month ago and I only wish I bought it sooner.\nLiterally within 3 minutes of applying the eye cream I can feel and see the undereye area tighten and depuff! It's incredible!!! \n\nThe only downside is I have sensitive skin, especially around my eyes, and it becomes dry and itchy quickly. I have to apply moisturizer first before applying the eye cream. If I don't out down that base layer of moisturizer my eyes become extremely itchy throughout the day. I also don't use it on my eyelids. I only apply it underneath.\nMakeup applies easily over top!",
