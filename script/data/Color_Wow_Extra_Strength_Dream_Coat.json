I got the cezzanne treatment on my hair 3 months ago and find that its still slightly frizzy if I don't add product. Even after blow drying and flat ironing my hair, the next day my hair will be a bit frizzy, but not with this wow product. I was amazed at how well it stayed even after day 2&3.  The only place where it didn't work as well was at the beach, the humidity in NC beaches must be too much for the product but overall I'm pretty pleased with the magic of this product.  For reference I have very thick latin hair.",

Any bit of humidity or sweat resulted also resulted in massive frizz and curl.  THIS is the miracle I've been looking for!  It's not greasy and doesn't weigh my hair down like so many other products that kind of worked did, and the results still look great three-days later!\nI've tried both the regular and extra strength versions, and while both work well, the extra strength formula seems to be formulated for someone like me whose hair is on the dry side.

I have super thick, heavy, wavy-ish hair and lots of grays, short hairs, and ends that like to frizz up. \n\nI spray this on my damp hair after shampoo/conditioner, split into sections and spray again. Then I just use my hair dryer brush, using tension + heat and i get beautiful straight frizz-free hair in like 30 mins. It lasts all the way to my next hair washing (usually 1-1.5 weeks depending on weather) and from there my hair remains way less frizzy and more manageable for another week or so, even with more washing or just getting it wet\n\nAnd then the cycle starts again. Really nice that it keeps my hair looking presentable for so long as a working mom",

My husband and I both use it, we have very different hair, and we bought our last bottle 7/21/23. It is now 10/20/23 and we still have the same bottle! (Granted we do not wash our hair often, BUT we use it every time even though it lasts through 3-4 shampoos :face_with_finger_covering_closed_lips:) I'm pretty sure I won't need to open our new bottle until next month! So that's seriously less than $0.40 a DAY. No, I do not work for Color WOW :laughing: I just know I am super-thrifty, but I'll never give this stuff up. There is *one* dupe; I gave it a good try but had to come back to Dream Coat. The dupe is ~half the price, but it def only performs half as well :confused: I'm pretty sure the polymers in Dream Coat are proprietary, so that's probably why! My hair is straight, thick, past my shoulders, colored black every 5 weeks, and has a little wave. Works AMAZING. My husband? Thin, fine, bleached-platinum shoulder-length hair, so without Dream Coat and straightening? His hair starts looking like cotton candy ☹️ WITH Dream Coat? It is smooth, silky, bouncy, it is NIGHT & DAY. I put up a review w/ pics & video on Influenster. As you can tell, I can't shut up about it lol. I have turned EVERYONE on to it. I live in Kentucky where it can be bone-chillingly cold out one day, then sticky-humid tornado weather the next :P This stuff OWNS humidity! Okay, I'll stop... But not before the BONUS: Their Mist-ical Shine Spray is also amazing & lasts even longer!   Toodles!  -an insanely avid user",

        "comments": "I loved this product because it did make my hair so much less frizzy, I mean, i got caught in the rain running errands and I expected my hair to poofy up, but it didn't!\nThe issue came after using the product for a while. I started having massive breakage in my hair. Like practically crumbling at the slightest touch and movement. My derm diagnosed me with trichorrhexis nodosa and we narrowed it down to this product! I stopped and we are starting to see some improvement. My stylist even pulled this from her salon because of the issue she is seeing and had with herself! Please be careful!",
