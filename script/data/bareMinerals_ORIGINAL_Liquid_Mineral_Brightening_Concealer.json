I must have tried four other concealers to no avail. They were either too chalky, too heavy, or too drying. Since I already had used and loved BM's Complexion Rescue Gel Makeup for years, I thought I'd give this concealer a shot. WOW. I use it around my eyes, nostrils, and just above and below my lips. It's like a facelift, really. I consider this the core of my makeup now. Without it, I do not know what I'd do. It actually makes the Gel makeup work better. It's not cheap, but it's the real deal.",

THIS item however, does no such thing.\n\nThe shades have changed and my corresponding shade is now very yellow. Note; I have yellow in my skin, but this is very unnatural looking and almost android-like. Not flatteting AT ALL.\nThen, its so thin, runny and dries so fast that it's impossible to conceal anything. I have no idea what or how to use this product. A concealer should conceal, not be sheer.\nIt's almost as if a key ingredient (the serum perhaps?) in the OG formula was completely removed or something. \n\nIve already moved on to another concealer brand and been buying from them. This new formulation from bareMinerals sadly is a hard pass for me. I like my products to work and do what they say they are going to do. Unfortunately, this item is no longer it for me.",

I'm not buttering up a company just to get more free things, I do this for people like me who need thorough reviews before they buy something! \n\nI'll start by saying, that as a reviewer, I don't always get the right color of something. I am also extremely pale, and not a lot of companies carry shades that match me.\nI was not send the lightest shade, but that's okay, because I have 3 kids and a husband that I can use to help me! In this case, my husband!\n\nThe first thing I noticed was how thin the product was when rubbing it between two fingers. It is almost watery, but not runny, just incredibly light weight, unlike most concealers I've used over the years. It's weightless on the skin, can't be felt at all!\n\nEven with it being a weightless and thin product there's absolutely NO inadequacy when it comes to coverage! Its covering power is amazing! \n\nMy favorite thing about it was how natural it looked. We all know how it is to put makeup over peach fuzz and it just messes up the whole look, but that's not an issue with this concealer at all! Put it in my husband and there was no product clinging to his peach fuzz on his upper cheeks at all! Even over peach fuzz, it still looked like skin!\n\nThis product truly looks like skin! It's incredible! It covers dark under eyes, redness, and blemishes.\n\nI absolutely love it and I think it's going to be a product my husband is actually going to use! (YES! It really is THAT natural looking!!)",

The new original concealer does have a better range of shades, but it is not an adequate replacement for the serum concealer. This one dries very quickly, which made it a bit difficult to blend. It is also impossible to blend over makeup throughout the day, if you need to touch up your makeup. This one also does not go on as smooth as its predecessor and does not look as natural for me. It also gets a little cakey if trying to layer for better coverage (it also doesn't seem to provide as full of coverage as their serum concealer did, so I have to let it dry and try to layer it on a couple of darker spots on my skin.) If not comparing to their serum concealer, it's overall not a bad product on it's own. Had I not tried their serum concealer and loved it for so long, I probably would have given this one a higher rating. I may buy it again until I find another product that I love, but will be shopping around for a better replacement for their serum concealer.",
