For this price, it should be packaged more securely. The product that got on my hands was sticky and tacky, and I'm not sure that it wouldn't have made my hair clumpy. It's being returned.",

I would have never found this product, because I think this is a men's line, however, I saw it during the 21 days of beauty and found it interesting a powder can provide medium hold, so I had to try it.  Blown away by how well this product performs.   \n\nMy hair is super fine like baby hair and I have tried all types of volumizers and dry shampoos and tapioca starch in the past.  Those other products were drying, left my hair stiff or feeling dirty, or only held for 10 minutes at most.   This product is so lightweight and somehow sticks to yr hair, yet you don't feel you have any product in your hair and it provided me with the fullness I wanted.   After half an hour, it came down some, but I just refluffed and it stayed.  It will definitely be included in my arsenal of products.   Is a little pricey for such a small small bottle, however, I do think it's worth it to have around for those days your hair needs a boost.\n\nLet's not let the men have all the fun with this product, so hoping they market to women as well.",
