My super dry lips have healed so nicely - i put this product on before bed and in the morning, most of it is still there and i toss and turn a lot.  My lips dont feel tight anymore, very supple and fuller!  Very happy with my purchase.  I used to use much more expensive brands and my lips never felt this great.  The texture melts onto my skin and thr sents are heavenly.",

It's smooth, weightless, smells amazing (I have apple), and best of all NOT GREASY OR STICKY! I mainly use it as a night time treatment since a little goes a long way, however it also works great as a pre-moisturizing treatment before applying lipsticks, lip tints, and liquid lipsticks (just be sure you wipe off a majority of it off first before applying color). My lips definitely feel way more smooth and plump with this product! Only thing I can gripe on is that I wish it had a little applicator that came with it instead of me dipping my finger into it.",

After one application (you only need a little bit, less than the size of a pea) my lips felt intensely hydrated, looked juicy and shiny, and smelled incredibly fresh. I find that the hydrating effect and shine last even longer than the comparable Tatcha The Kissu Lip Mask. It lasts on my lips for about 1-3 hours before I reapply depending on if I eat or drink after putting it on. I like to use it as a heavenly mask for my lips at night before bed and before I go to work in the morning. I loved it so much that I went back days later and bought it in Mango as well - perfect scents for spring and summer! I can't wait to purchase the Honey Vanilla and Apple ones for fall.",

        "comments": "I never thought I would say this, but this is in fact better than the laneige lip mask… and it's not even close. To give some context, I'm allergic to beeswax so I can't use chapsticks and a lot of lip balms. I also have really dry skin and don't drink as much water as I should… see my problem? Finding the laneige lip masks was life changing, and I wore this as my regular lip balm daily for the past few years. I recently picked up one of these farmacy lip smoothies because they were slightly cheaper and had an apple scent, which is my favorite scent. I figured the difference would be indistinguishable, but immediately I was impressed with how much more hydrating the lip smoothie was! I noticed I had to re-apply more frequently because my lips were DRINKING UP this smoothie vs the laniege that would mostly just sit on top of my lips and provide temporary hydration. The corners of my lips crack very frequently… again, BECAUSE I KNOW I DONT DRINK ENOUGH WATER… but this lip smoothie literally HEALED IT OVERNIGHT!!! That has never once happened with the Laniege lip masks. Obviously, I'm not trying to dunk too hard on laneige, I enjoyed their product for years, but this is just far superior and also more affordable and with better scents IMO. I'm going to pick up the pear kiwi scent tomorrow!",

I did find one I like and have been using for the last several months. My lips tend to get so dry during the winter which is when I focus on extra care for them to keep them soft and moisturized. I've never heard of the lip smoothie before and it's right up my alley to try! I received the lip smoothie in Honey Vanilla. The scent is exactly what it is, honey vanilla without being overpowering or artificial scented/taste. I immediately tried it that night and had my bestie tried it too. The texture of the lip smoothie is lightweight, kind of whipped, and a little sticky. I used my finger to apply and a little goes a long way! It was an almost immediate moisturizer for my lips. The lip smoothie left my lips shiny and my fingers a little sticky after applying. The stickiness didn't bother me as it wasn't sticky applying it on. When applying it to your lips, you can feel the slight warmth as it melts onto your lips. I tried it before I went to sleep. The next morning after, about 8 hours later, my lips were very soft and smooth! I didn't need to reapply again. I've been using it since for the last two weeks or so and it's my new favorite! I already went to look at what other scents they had. My bestie who was visiting also tried it and completely loved the lip smoothie too. She will be getting herself one also. I usually use it every night before bed or before I apply lipstick/lip stain before going out. Don't leave your lips dry and hanging, try it now!",

The formula is just as lovely as the ones I've used before but this scent/flavor (Gifted by farmacybeauty) is not very pleasant. It reminds me of a cheap French vanilla candle with a little bit of a maple syrup note thrown in. As much as I love this line, skip honey vanilla for a different version!",
