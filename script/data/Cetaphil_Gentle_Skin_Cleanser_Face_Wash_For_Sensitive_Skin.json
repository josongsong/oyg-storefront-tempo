Both are perfect and I love!! I have been using since 2010 and I love how makes my skin feel and I love that I can use for face and body. I turned 45 years old this year and I am aways told that I look like I'm 20 !! I total believe that this is because of using Cetaphil Gentle Skin Clenser For All Skin Types and Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion For All Skin Types !\r\nI feel so fortunate to have found amazing and perfect products.",

        "comments": "I have been using Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser for over 35 years. It is NOT the same formula that I remember. The viscosity is not what it used to be. This once creamy and effective product has disappeared only to be replaced by a very watery substance that falls through my fingers. I think this is a serious disservice to many loyal customers that have been using this product over the course of a lifetime. Very expensive and a complete waste. Very disappointing.",
