I always have clear glass skin when I use this. I use this as a first cleanse in a double cleanse routine. Every time I use an oil cleanser or a balm, I get acne. And regular micellar water is cool and all, but it takes more effort and dries my skin out. This doesn't. This is perfect. And it really cleans my pores. Every time I have one of my girlies sleep over, they use it and tell me they love it. PLEASE DONT DISCONTINUE. YOU JUST NEED BETTER INFLUENCER MARKETING ON TIKTOK FOR THIS CAUSE IT REALLY IS THAT GOOD. It removes makeup and spf so easily for a first cleanse. I used to have glass perfect influencer-like skin and when I stopped using this I started having bad skin. And when I decided to recover my bad skin and revert back to this, it started healing. Genuinely so crazy how this is the corporate for genuine good skin and a proper cleanse.",

I add a small pump to a damp washcloth and massage it around my face to remove makeup and greasy grossness, then wipe again with the clean side of the damp cloth. I've noticed decreased breakouts and blackheads since using. Only downside I've found is that it does sting a bit if you get it in your eyes… Big deal.",

        "comments": "I want to preface this review by saying that I'm nearly 42 years old, and it's only in the past couple of years that I felt like I didn't have the skin of a teenager.  My skin is very oily, and until I finally figured out a routine that would work, was very prone to breakouts.  With that being said, I was going to be very picky about changing my routine and trying a new product.  My first impression of the Garnier Micellar Foaming Gel Cleanser upon feeling the thin consistency of the product was, \"How is this really going to cleanse my skin?\"  I must say, it lives up to it's claims of gently removing my makeup.  Even though it wasn't a thick as cleansers I've used in the past, it easily and gently cleansed my skin.  I usually used a couple of pumps of product and gently massage it with water into my skin.  After rinsing, my skin was clean, but not tight like harsher cleansers tend to make it.  It was soft, supple and  clean.  I didn't feel like I still had makeup left behind on my skin.   \n\nThe one drawback (and the reason I'm rating this a 4/5) is that it didn't remove my eye makeup like I'd hope it would.  It did break it down, but I was usually left with black smears around my eyes from where my mascara wasn't completely removed.  In the before/after picture I've attached, I did use baby oil to remove my eye makeup before finishing with the Garnier Micellar Foaming Gel Cleanser.  That combination worked well and made me feel like I was truly going to bed with a cleansed face.  \n\nOverall, I didn't notice any negative changes to my skin.  It felt clean, kept breakouts at bay, and didn't increase the oil production of my skin.  This is definitely a new way of cleansing my face and I would recommend that others of all skin types try it as well.",

        "comments": "I kept hearing great things about micellar water cleansers, and I'm always looking for simple and non drying ways to remove makeup and wash my face.  I'm sorry but this was terrible.  I very rarely wear mascara, which there is no WAY this would remove it if I did, this couldn't even remove eyeshadow.  It's literally the worst \"cleanser\" I've ever used.  I'm also not very prone to breakouts, and this caused me to breakout!! As in multiple zits!!  I don't recall the last time I had ONE zit, let alone several! Judging by how it didn't remove makeup, I'm thinking it didn't remove anything at all, and the breakouts were probably caused my dirt, oil, and other buildup.  I think the 10 days or so I used this was as if I didn't wash my face for 10 days!! It also smelled horrible.  Sort of like perfume, but also sorta like just straight up \"fumes\", like turpentine or something?? Really weird.  Oh, and I almost forgot to mention, the pump broke off the first time I used it, and I was having to pour it out.\nAll around horrible, I would never recommend this to a friend or even an enemy.",
