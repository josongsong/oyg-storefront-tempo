The other thing I wasn't too impressed with was the fact that it didn't blend well with my foundations.  I've used it with a couple different brands and it sorted balled up.  I applied the vit-C cream 30 minutes before applying the foundation so it had plenty of time to soak...  I also applied the cream with a light hand.  \nI will go back to my other brand of eye cream once this is used up.  In my opinion, not worth the cost.",

It gives the texture of the skin a glowing, translucent effect. It also has a moisturizing effect that fills in the wrinkles so they become so unnoticeable that they look practically non-existent. This eye cream is definitely my ammunition for combating aging. I make sure to never run out of this as no other eye cream can replace it and I have tried many throughout the years. This one is truly remarkable and should be given an award for its amazing anti-aging benefits!",
