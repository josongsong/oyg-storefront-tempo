It is thick and sticky but I think that's what makes it longer lasting than a lot of other lip balms. The applicator is nicely shaped so that it makes it easy to apply to the lips. One con is that it is quite hard to squeeze it out of the tube - I have to squeeze with both hands sometimes when the weather is colder. However, I left it in my car in the heat and it was much easier to squeeze.",

        "comments": "Ive tried multiple different brands to help with my dry lips and this is the only balm thats been able to help aid in the healing process. It adds a nice layer of protection that allows the skin on your lips to retain moisture. I know plain vaseline can do the same but unfortunately my lips react a little badly to vaseline. Also this balm adds a nice sheen of color just enough to even out the lips for that natural healthy look. It last pretty decently which is a big plus considering im using it as a protective product for chronic lip dryness. \n\nCONS\nIts true that the balm is on the stickier side for a \"balm\" but it doesnt feel unpleasant for me. I dislike slimy greasy feelings on the lips. This balm is more of a tacky feeling which im okay with. If you like the consistency of vaseline you probably will not like this product. Its on the thicker side. In cold weather the balm can solidify a bit making it hard to squeeze out the tube. I just warm it between my hands a little bit and it resolves that issue but it is extra work so thats something i hope the brand improves in the future.",

        "comments": "I just got a tube of the naturium lip balm and I immediately loved! What others don't like about it, is what I love about it. The thickness makes the balm last a good amount of time even after eating or drinking. The color of mine was sheer but that's okay because it's enough to even out the color of my lips. \nI didnt think the price was too bad either, but the applicator was chef's kiss for me. Normally other balms squeeze some of the product onto a flat surface applicator but they dont spread it evenly over my lips. I would definitely recommend and will be buying more.",

Once it started selling out I decided to order from the site. I gladly  waited for the restock after I presume it went viral on TikTok…After paying nearly 30 for two lipglosses both of them were practically empty! I had to squeeze the bottle as if I were on my last little bit left. :( so saddd. The Jam also didn't have nearly as much color as it used to have, and it feels a bit more thick and sticky than before. However, my main concern is the fact that they were both basically empty. I would like another shipment of both glosses that is full as I feel I was grossly underfed with this order. :/ love my gloss, I just feel that since I paid for a new one lol I should have a full and fresh new order of gloss.. As this unfortunately  feels like scraps.",
