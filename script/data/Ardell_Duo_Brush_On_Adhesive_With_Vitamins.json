I prefer the brush on as I can control the amount and placement of the product better, but that's definitely a personal preference. I've also used their \"spatula\" style applicators and they also work great. Dries moderately quickly, so good for beginners and easily distracted people (like me) - won't stay too wet for too long and get everywhere, but if you need a minute to adjust placement or something it's not going to dry too quickly. Have purchased many times.",

However, I did notice with this last tube I purchased, I had a minor allergic reaction, and you could see little red spots from where I glued down my stones for about 1-2 days. I know it's not meant to be used on the eyelid, but I hadn't experienced this before and after reading some of the reviews, it does look like others are speculating a formula change due to a sudden allergic reaction. It's worked fine with my eyelashes, but I'll have to purchase something else for my lids.",

        "comments": "I have no eyelashes on one eye due to a medical condition and I wear fake strip lashes daily as a replacement. I also have really watery eyes. It's really important to me that my fake lashes/glue stay in place and look natural as a result. This is the ONLY lash glue I have ever found that will keep my lashes down, even when exposed to water. Others I have tried, including the tube version, might have good adherence initially, but once my eyes water, the inner corner will start to come loose. This does product DOES NOT BUDGE. What I do is to apply the adhesive like eyeliner directly on my lid, then do the same to the thin band of my strip lashes. When the glue on my lid turns blue (< 30 sec) I stick 'em on. You do have to be sort of quick about this because if the glue on your lid starts to turn clear, then it's already dried and won't be as sticky as it should be. The good news is, if you mess up and wait too long, you can just apply more glue to your lid right over whatever dried and try again. When I first bought this glue, I took a shower with them on to test them out. Verdict: No peeling, no loosening at the corners. Perfect! I even dribbled a little water directly on my eye and let it sit there for 5 mins and they STILL didn't come off! (Protip: since this stuff is clear, after my lashes are on I sometimes brush a little extra over the inner edge of the lash band to really seal it on. I don't even really think this is necessary but it's a nice feature, since it dries clear).  \n\nI really hope they never stop making this product because I have never felt more confident about my lashes being secure than with this stuff. For those that mentioned the glue not being tacky enough... that's a real puzzler because it certainly is for me! Maybe applying directly to the lid helps, or maybe they accidentally let it dry for too long? For those that are looking for their falsies to hold up all day and in rough conditions, I would highly recommend this lash adhesive.",
