I came out with the Midnight Recovery Botanical Cleansing Oil, this Milk Peel Gentle Exfoliating Toner, and the Ultra Facial Cream.  I have been using this routine religiously for two months now, and saw a photo the other day and could not believe the difference.  My skin color has even changed!  I swear the Milk Peel Toner is the main reason - I absolutely love how it feels on my face, and how supple my skin feels immediately after applying it.  I don't wear nearly as much makeup anymore, because I feel so confident with just a fresh face.",
