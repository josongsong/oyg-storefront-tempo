        "comments": "I was intrigued by the ingredients, and I love that its gentle enough for the eye area as well. I'm an esthetician and ive worked in the cosmetics industry for over a decade, so I'm very picky when it comes to the products I use. To be perfectly honest I did not want to use anything from Drunk Elephant because I thought it was overhyped and overpriced, and TikTok made it too appealing to tweens. After some hesitation I eventually tried the C-Firma Fresh Day Serum to see what the craze was about, and also to see if I could discredit the brand… It turns out I actually loved it, and I even love the A-Shaba Retinol Eye Serum, so I was very excited to try the lip balm when I learned of its existence. The ingredients were pretty solid, and it was the same price as the lip balm I currently swear by, so why not give it a go? Let me preface by saying that I have chronically dry lips, I am a lip balm junkie and connoisseur, and that the sensation of dry lips to me is equivalent to (if not worse than) nails on a chalkboard. I put it on and it was… interesting. It had some slip, it was conditioning, but it didn't feel thick. Then after about 10-15 minutes it felt like it was disappearing, and by the 20-30 minute mark it was completely gone and my lips felt very dry. Apart from leaving me dry, I really do not like the packaging; while it is very short (makes you wonder how much product you're actually getting) it is very thick, so it was not comfortable in my pocket. As someone who doesn't carry a purse or a bag, I need my items to be pocket friendly, and this was not the case. The finish was oddly matte, and I like just a hint of shine. As I mentioned earlier, it was very thin feeling, and I much prefer something that feels cushiony. The last concern I have is that with it being a coconut oil base, this thing will melt crazy fast (my personal assumption) if left in the car. So between packaging and a lack of moisture, no, I do not recommend this product.",
