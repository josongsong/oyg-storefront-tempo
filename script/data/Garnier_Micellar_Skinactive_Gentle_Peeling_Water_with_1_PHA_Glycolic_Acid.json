        "comments": "After major surgery, I've been re-learning my skin, which has been challenging. I never had breakouts, dark spots, flaking, or texture before. I started learning makeup to boost my confidence. I bought this product because I dislike makeup wipes and their scent. After using it on bare skin in the morning, it reduced flakiness. I follow up with moisturizer for hydration. Over two weeks, it has significantly improved my textured bumps and reduced breakouts. I believe the glycolic acid is effective. I love this product and use it as a cleanser in the morning rather than washing my face or makeup remover. (though I prefer a cleansing balm for extra effectiveness cause i feel it doesn't remove make up well) I'll definitely repurchase it. I know everyone's different, but it's worth trying if you're struggling with similar concerns.",

When i only used it once a week or so, it was ok for cleansing but didn't do anything else. I tried using it more often, and as soon as i used it two nights in a row, my skin broke out in a rash. It started out as a red, irritated patch over the bridge of my nose and spread out over my face over the next week or so, even after i stopped using this product that first day. It's been about 2-3 weeks now and my skin is still itchy, flaky, and irritated. My skin barrier is totally shot and i can't use any actives at all, even gentle ones, without more irritation and burning. Stick to the vitamin c version if you want some sort of active. I used that one every night for about a year with no issues at all. Doesn't clear skin, though.",

Ive tried a lot of AHA and BHA products in the past that were far too harsh and caused painful breakouts. This was perfect!

The best part- I already notice my dark spots fading! I can't recommend it enough.",

        "comments": "I was excited dto try this micellar Water with added benefits of 1%PHA & Glycolic Acid by Garneir. I love that the brand is Cruelty Free certified thru Leaping Bunny as well as being vegan. The packaging is also made from 100% recycled plastic, so yes, I was on board to see how well it worked.\n\nEverytime I've tried a makeup remover like this, it's left my skin feeling sticky, not very clean and almost everytime, I still end up using my regular face wash and water. However, Garnier has changed the game with this one! This micellar water is so easy to use and my skin actually feels refreshed post use! I have been using it as a first step cleanse when I don't have time or don't feel like going thru an oil or a balm cleanse. I also have been using it to wipe off mistakes when doing my makeup. I'm really impressed with the ability to cleanse with minor rubbing. I hate rubbing my eyelashes to get mascara off of them, I feel it leads to lash loss. This is a simple pout on reusable cotton round & press onto skin. I wipe it away with a clean cloth and my makeup is GONE. I do use a gel cleanser after this, mainly because I wear sunscreen and want to make sure everything is off my face for the night. But it's been really nice to not go thru the hassle, cost & blurry vision that some balms or oils can cause. \n\nI'd definitely recommend this to any makeup enthusiasts as well as any MUA, it gets makeup swatches off really easily (yes, even eyeliner!).\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the dispensing method. I love a pump style dispenser for easier,  hands free use and it is more convenient on the go or for traveling when time/space is limited.",

        "comments": "I love trying out new skincare products and was very hopeful for the All-In-1 Micellar Gentle Peeling Water. Unfortunately for me, I did not find this to live up to the all-in-1 cleanse, remove and exfoliate. I used this on a cotton swab, and while it definitely takes off some of my makeup, harder to remove makeup like mascara, liner and eye gel does not budge. I think this would be more useful as part of a double cleanse to remove any foundation or powders from the face or as a morning wash when you need a light cleansing before makeup application. I did find this formula to be very gentle, so if you have had problems with stronger glycolic acids I would recommend trying this less harsh formula. I will continue to use as part of a double cleanse, but unlikely will repurchase because I find other products better suited for my personal needs.",
