        "comments": "My skin is quite oily especially on my t-zone but I can get dehydrated very easily. I like this version because it doesnt feel harsh or drying, which some may think is better for oily skin but drying it can cause more oil production. This product takes makeup off very easily especially if you hold for a few seconds on your eyes for eye makeup removal. I'm also easily acne prone and this hasn't given me any issues. Sometimes I also use it as a quick cleanser in the morning if I feel that my skin is a little sensitive and prefer not to wash with a foaming cleanser.",

In my 40s I switched over to the blue. I love this product. It is the best eye makeup remover in existence. It's gentle and pleasant and doesn't strip my skin of crucial moisture. I love the subtle tingly feeling it gives. I love how valuable it is for fixing makeup smears etc. Travel friendly too: you can be without water access and still clean your face.",
