But either way i used this and it did help or change my appearance. Yes i used as directed and finished the whole thing. I guess the good thing is that it dodnt cause any harm but still! I was skeptical about putting something around my eyes and wondering if it wouod do more harm than good. But nope just didnt work. Which is surprising bc majority of the comments say other wise.",

        "comments": "This product is amazing and does exactly what it claims! Probably my favorite of all the CeraVe line.\n\nReally the dark circle relief and puffiness relief in the morning is what impressed me, I've been using it only a week and a half, so I'm still waiting for the darker circles at my inner eye to fade with further use. Already the main portion of my dark circles have faded to invisibility.\n\nI use this product everyday once in the Morning and once at Night. I spread it along the orbital bone as my dermatologist instructed (VERY IMPORTANT, and the cream will reach the rest of the undereye area from the orbital bone area, don't worry) which will prevent the bumps/breakouts some people report using this (bumps/breakouts comes from getting it in the eye/tear duct itself, though it's possible some reviewers were just allergic so always patch test!). I also use the cream on my top lid because I have some dark/brown discoloration there and it seems to be helping that fade as well.\n\nIt's disappeared most of my dark circles almost completely and I can tell the skin under my eye isn't so thin anymore--I get itchy eyes a lot so the skin around my eye has thinned out and this product has countered that and started to restore the healthiness to the skin around my eye.\n\nThe only warning about this product I'd give is that it can sometimes mildly burn if the skin around your eye is thin--the burning will go away once you use this for awhile as it thickens the skin around your eye. It also burns pretty bad if you get it in your eye, so pleaseplease avoid that! And again only apply under the eye by feeling around the orbital bone (that bone under your eye) to avoid getting it in your eye and causing irritation to the eye, or worse, in some peoples' case, breakouts and bumps.\n\nThe only other complaint I have is that I wish they gave you more cream for the price. It's still a fair price, though, considering how well it works. But I've recommended this to a friend and will continue to do so with everyone I know who struggles with eye discoloration, puffiness in the morning and/or thinness of the skin around the eye.",

Here's my two cents:\n\nI love that this cream comes in a tube because it makes the application very easy.  The only con to this is that I have no idea how much product is still in there after a month's use.  It still feels like there's quite a bit left, though.\n\nThe cream is a nice, thick formula and blends quickly and smoothly into the skin.  I usually wait about 5 minutes for it to sink in before applying my makeup, and I have no problem with smudging.\n\nOverall, it's a good product for the price.  Considering the reputation of the brand and the fact that this cream contains hyaluronic acid, I was expecting better results.  While it moisturizes well, it didn't deliver on repairing and restoring my under eye area.",
