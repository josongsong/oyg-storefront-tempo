About 2years ago I began getting regular facials & altered my diet (no more soy) to help with various issues. It was then that my facialist (sorry, not a word, but I don't know how to spell that profession that begins with the letter 'A' and ends with letters 'IST) informed me that today's facial cleaners are not formulated to remove all dirt, makeup and impurities and strongly suggested the addition of makeup remover and/or micellar water to my face cleaning routine. I researched products online in search of a good micellar water fit for combo skin. The Garnier micellar water (green top) effectively removes most of my face makeup in the evening. I follow up with a general deep cleaning face wash (I use a general acne wash in the morning) and know that my face is fully cleansed. The micellar does not dry out my skin whatsoever so I can use it as a general quick pick-me-up face cleanse after my gym workout or a few hours after washing my face (prior to running a few quick errands). This is not the best micellar water for removing eye makeup, but it can remove most eyeshadows easily (its the mascara that puts up a fight). I still use general eyemakeup remover regardless.\nThere is NO greasy feeling/residue on my face after using this brand, unlike several other brands (including Garniers pink topped micellar water).",

        "comments": "I have used the pink and blue Garnier Micellar Cleansing Waters without any issue for the past year, but the instant I swiped the new All-in-1 Mattifying cleansing water on my face I got a rash on my face.  This has never happened with any other product I've used so I don't think I have overly sensitive skin.  I don't know why this product was so terrible for me.  It has already been four days since the rash first appeared and it is still present--no longer red, but my face has a lot of texture whereas it used to be smooth.  I compared the ingredients and saw there are a few more ingredients in this product than the classic pink lid bottle, so I much be allergic to something in this bottle.  Just be careful if you choose to try this product.",
