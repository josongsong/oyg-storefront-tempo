These wipes are incredibly gentle yet effective, easily removing makeup (even waterproof mascara!) without any tugging or irritation.\n\nWhat I love most is how soothing they are on my skin. My skin is quite sensitive, and I often struggle with products that leave me feeling dry or tight afterward, but these wipes are different. They leave my face feeling soft, refreshed, and perfectly hydrated, thanks to the nourishing oat extract. I also appreciate that they're free from harsh fragrances, making them a great choice for anyone with sensitive skin.\n\nNot only do they do an amazing job at removing makeup, but they're also incredibly convenient for those late nights when I just want to cleanse my face quickly before bed. I love that I don't have to rinse or follow up with a cleanser, as my skin feels thoroughly cleansed and balanced.\n\nIf you're looking for a gentle yet effective makeup remover that hydrates while cleansing, these wipes are an absolute must-have. I can't imagine my skincare routine without them!",
