Ive always stayed away from \"oils\" because of the fear of clogged pores. I received this as a sample when i purchased their pore cleansing balm and holy moly, this stuff is amazing! Typically, i only use La Roche-Posay purifying cleanser, but i used this oil first and after both washes i couldn't believe how great my skin felt! Ive never used a cleansing oil before, so i cannot compare this one to anything, but i CAN say that my skin has never felt so totally clean of makeup, grease, and dirt! \nWithout a doubt i will be purchasing the full sized bottle, and without hesitation i will tell everyone i know about how remarkable this Hanskin cleansing oil is! Just… wow!",

Hanskin's product does not smell at all except for a light citrus scent but even then it's not even noticeable. I would definitely recommend this product!

Since my skin is acne prone and I have never tried an oil cleanser before, I was still using my normal cleanser after to avoid any breakouts. My skin remained clear thankfully. It also felt softer and smelled great even after using another cleanser.  I live in a dry climate so I think that it is a perfect nighttime cleanser to refresh after a long day. The oil reminds me of professional facial treatments I have had (prior to stay at home orders) that included a facial massage and aromatherapy. The smell to me was the best part! It was on the stronger side but had an amazing complex citrus smell that felt refreshing and energizing. I can be sensitive to perfume fragrance smells that can trigger migraines so I appreciated this natural fruit smell. I can see though if you do not like any fragrance then you should avoid this product because it is strong and lasting. I also thought the pump was well designed, no dripping after using which was surprising for such a silky, oily product. Overall I thought the product was high quality and impressive. My concern would be the warning on the label about sun exposure however it might be worth extra diligence on sunscreen in my sunny climate since it is also a dry climate. If this product could contain a sunscreen somehow and still have all the same benefits it would be absolutely perfect.",

It's lightweight and I was surprised at how nice and clean my skin felt after using it. It didn't particularly help with my breakouts, and left my skin seemingly more oily throughout the day. I think this product would be best used for make up removal, during winter months when your skin is more dry, or for skin that isn't acne prone.",
