It's  offensive when It tells you it's not same when it's clearly not.  Just be honest if there's a change.  I have 2 new ones that I will discard.  This is really drying",

I don't like the feel of makeup on my face and I also felt it would sink into my wrinkles, until I tried this. My skin is so even and glowing when I wear this! It feels like I have nothing on! I also get compliments from my closest friends as well as strangers. I threw away all the other foundations and will only wear this one from now on! I feel so confident and pretty at 60! Thank you It Cosmetics!!",

The tester in the store was not nearly as shimmery as the one I bought. It almost appeared as if I was putting highlighter all over my face. My pores were huge and I did use a pore filling primer.",
