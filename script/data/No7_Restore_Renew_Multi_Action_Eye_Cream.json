This does nothing, my undereye are not well hydrated after use, the entire tube i have not seen any sort of difference in the texture of my under eyes, fine lines, or even eyebag color. While this isn't luxury skincare price it is certainly more expensive than some of my other go-to products that actually work. I am over using this product at this point to just get rid of it before moving onto my tried and true Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm.\n\nThis eye cream has also caused a slight breakout over the past week. Ive been taking a little more than normal and breaking it lower then JUST under my eyes. Everywhere else on my face that has larger pores is starting to breakout where ive been using this product. \n\nTL;DL - This is a bad product priced way to high for what it is. after about 7/8 of the tube i have not noticed any effects its had on my skin even hydration wise.",

I ended up with dark circles under my eyes & I was so worried because my skin is so stubborn that nothing works. I went to Ulta & the manager suggested this product & I have to say, it helped boost my confidence. I'm on day 9 of using it & the dark circles are about 95% gone. I had dark purple bags under my eyes & I would have to build up the concealer to hide them, but thanks to this product, I can now go out without concealer. Definitely buying more!",

This does nothing, my undereye are not well hydrated after use, the entire tube i have not seen any sort of difference in the texture of my under eyes, fine lines, or even eyebag color. While this isn't luxury skincare price it is certainly more expensive than some of my other go-to products that actually work. I am over using this product at this point to just get rid of it before moving onto my tried and true Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm.\n\nThis eye cream has also caused a slight breakout over the past week. Ive been taking a little more than normal and breaking it lower then JUST under my eyes. Everywhere else on my face that has larger pores is starting to breakout where ive been using this product. \n\nTL;DL - This is a bad product priced way to high for what it is. after about 7/8 of the tube i have not noticed any effects its had on my skin even hydration wise.",
