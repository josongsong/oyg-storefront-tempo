She has extremely straight, slick, and flat hair that never holds a curl or hairstyle. To my surprise, she was incredibly impressed with the results! The hold and volume she achieved in her braid from this product alone were simply amazing. I've never seen her hair hold that well with a hairstyle before. If you have slick pin straight hair, I highly recommend this product. I'm planning to try curling her hair next time. It's definitely worth the try!",

Gives you great volume, texture, and it soaks up excess oils in your hair, leaving you with hair that is touchably soft, but still with enough grit to it that it holds your desired style well, and without being at all crunchy feeling. Also the scent is amazing, it just smells so nice, I absolutely love it.\n\nI have a growing out shaved head with a mohawk section that when left to fall to either side of my head reaches about at my chin length wise, and this product has been my go to since I received it to give my freshly washed hair the little bit of grit it needs to help it not just fall completely flat and limp, as well as to use when my hair hasn't been washed in a week and is in desperate need of some oils being soaked up before I can look presentable to be seen by other living beings, all while giving me effortless style, and a good amount of volume that makes me happy.\n\nI'd absolutely recommend this to others, but personally I will be sad when my current bottle runs out because at the price point I'm not always able to afford to pick up a new can (the price point is literally the only downside to this product in my opinion.)",
