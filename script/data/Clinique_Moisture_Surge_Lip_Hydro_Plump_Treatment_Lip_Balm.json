This balm is ACTUALLY hydrating, and lightweight w/o feeling runny. You really don't need to use much of this product to see great results! My only suggestion is a different applicator.. such as a half pointed silicone tip of sorts. But that's just my preference :-)",

I've tried every ointment, vaseline, chapstick, lip treatment on the market and nothing made a big enough difference. Until this baby. Ive had it only a few weeks, and the improvement has been incredible. I now only really need to use it at night, and my lips have barely peeled at all since using it. It is absolutely expensive I know, but it is worth every single cent. Excuse me while i buy 9 more.",

I love the Moisture Surge line and haven't found the right lip product that lasts on my perennially dry lips. The only ones that have gotten close are the Ole Henrikson and Laneige Lip Mask. This is the sleeper hit that no one seems to know about. The applicator is not ideal, but once on, it lasts a long time and is the best in the field, by far. No flavor or fun colors, but for someone really looking for function, this is the winner. Note: yes, it will be sticky, but again, FUNCTION over everything.",

That was until I glanced in a mirror about an hour later on a day when I wasn't wearing any makeup. I was like, \"Whaaaat?\" This stuff not only gives a realistic, subtle plumping to my lips, it also seems to soften the fine lines around my mouth, and it lasts. With most plumping lip treatments, the effects seem to wear off in a couple of hours. Not this. It lasts for most of the day on me. It also doesn't sting me at all, unlike some other lip plumpers. I also have two spots that seem to always be dry, and this eliminated them in two days. The only downside that I can think of is that the full size tube is apparently not much bigger than the sample. But you don't need much. It might feel sticky if you apply too much. But you don't need much.",

I found it very drying for regular use and it made my chapped lips peel further. I tried using it after a shower as an occlusive but it didn't really last and my lips felt bald and dry within the hour...",
