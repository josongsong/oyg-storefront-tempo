This is the first product that I used, down to the last drop, in as long as I can remember. I was shocked waking up the first morning after using as part of my nightly routine the night before. my skin has never felt so hydrated, soft, and supple. I much prefer spray toners to pouring some on a cotton round, so the ease & eco-friendliness of the spray bottle is a major plus. I recommend to anyone looking for a new staple to their skincare routine.",

My mom & cousin are into skincare so I got into it & my cousin owns a Korean makeup/skincare store so yea I tried too many but this one here…. THIS IS THE ONE!!! I will forever buy this one. The spray is perfect, it doesn't spit out like some others, it's so hydrating & refreshing. I have not gotten any breakouts from it & it calms my skin soooo well!!! The ingredients are the best part!!! It has the best ingredients & this is actually what you need for your skin!!! I use this & Acure whipping cream which has tons of peptides & basically the best dupe for DE protini! It has alsmot the same great ingredients (the good ones) & I use the B oil from Strivectin & mix it together with the Acure after I use this toner. My face feels & looks sooo good when I wake up!!!! Trust me.,, you need this! It's the best!!! I'm so happy I researched. I always passed on this but I regret not getting it sooner cuz this is the one!!!",

But this gave me irritation bumps and small whiteheads that eventually led to full blown acne- which I also don't normally have an issue with save a random, ocassional spot. Took me a while to figure out this was the cause, but this toner is definitely the culprit.\n\n Tried to reincorporate it back into my routine a couple of times and even with just one use, I get reactions anywhere from immediate redness and heat in my face upon application to little irritation bumps sprinkled over my temples, cheeks and nose a few hours later. My skin just flat out doesn't like it. I don't find it at all hydrating either- actually makes my skin feel drier.",
