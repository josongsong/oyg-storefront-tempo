Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Wrinkle Correcting Cream fits the bill perfectly.\n\nThe texture of this cream is luxurious yet lightweight, making it comfortable to wear under makeup or on its own. It absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving behind a velvety finish that doesn't feel greasy or heavy.\n\nOne of the standout features of this cream is its wrinkle-correcting abilities. Formulated with Clinique's innovative technology, it targets lines and wrinkles, visibly improving their appearance over time. I've noticed a reduction in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth since incorporating this cream into my skincare routine.\n\nThe addition of SPF 30 is a huge bonus. Sun protection is essential for preventing further damage to the skin and minimizing the appearance of wrinkles. I love that I can rely on this cream for both hydration and sun protection without having to layer multiple products.\n\nDespite containing SPF, the cream doesn't have that typical sunscreen smell and doesn't leave a white cast on my skin. It's also fragrance-free, which is great for those with sensitive skin like mine.\n\nThe packaging is sleek and practical, with a pump dispenser that ensures hygienic and mess-free application.\n\nOverall, Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Wrinkle Correcting Cream is a powerhouse moisturizer that delivers on its promises. It's a staple in my skincare routine, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to address signs of aging while protecting their skin from the sun.",

        "comments": "First off, I don't know why Influenster sent this to me after I stated in the survey I did NOT want a skincare product. I have sensitive skin and am very particular about the products I use on my skin and this is not something I can/will use.\n\nSecond, I have no use for a wrinkle correcting cream at this time. I was going to give it a try anyways but my first impressions were not positive. First off, it's thick. VERY thick. Like thicker than Elmer's glue. The cream doesn't even move if you shake it. And while other reviewers noted that it smells like a sunscreen, to me it has a very distinct petroleum odor.  \n\nI also find the packaging confusing. It's packaged as a wrinkle correcting cream but it also has all kinds of information about SPF and sun exposure. Is it a wrinkle cream or a sunscreen? When would you even use this in your skin care routine? Directions are very unclear. Either be an sunscreen or be a face cream. Expecting the user to apply at least every two hours is ridiculous. And to also use a sunscreen in addition to this if swimming or sweating is a bit much. \n\nSo overall I am not impressed with this product. It just isn't something I'm comfortable using on my skin.\n\n For the record I did reach out to Influenster about why I received this and to see if it could be sent to someone else as I was unsure about reviewing something that I didn't feel comfortable using but they never bothered to get back with me. So I did the best I could reviewing this under the circumstances.",
