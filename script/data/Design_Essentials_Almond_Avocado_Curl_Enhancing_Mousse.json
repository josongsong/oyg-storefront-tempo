Also mousse products do well if you have a dryer to sit under (I don't). I wanted to give up on the product but decided to repurpose as a protective style product. It's amazing for twist outs, keeps everything uniform and as long as I layer after a leave-in conditioner my hair stays moisturized for a week. The scent isn't too strong and the product didn't cause any contact irritation or acne like most products do to me. My hair is fine, medium density, mid-back length, medium to high porosity, and mixed patterned (3c to 4b). I have a sensitive scalp with dandruff issues.",

        "comments": "I have long type 4 high porosity coils and originally I used this product with the Camille Rose curl maker on top, and a different shampoo, and I got good pretty good day one results, but the moment my hair came around humidity it became sticky and all the definition disappeared. I love my botanical gels but they just don't seem to work great for me anymore, so I tried the three step method with the curls blueberry wash, camille conditioning custard, and just this mousse to style and I am wowed. My hair withstands humidity, if I don't manipulate it like crazy the day one definition lasts, it didn't take forever to dry and it was super easy to style. I just divide my damp hair (excess water squeezed out!) into 6 portions and apply liberally until most of my hair is defined and white, then I let it air dry. Also 0 flaking or stickiness!! Dried with a medium hold, my coils were soft but no crunch. Wish I could include photos. One section of my hair was a little dull and frizzy but that might be my own error.\n\nKey to this working for me was basically a good shampoo and no other leave-in/styling product, and then a lotttt of mousse, like 7-10 pumps per section and then some.",

        "comments": "While trying to transition to curly my stilylist recommended this product. At first it was good. I had a decent amount of volume, curl definition and shine. \nThen I started noticing my hair as a limp noodle constantly. My hair was also becoming more straw like. \nI live in Central Florida and was transitioning products a ton while getting my wavy hair routine down so I thought it was another product. \nNope, I finally picked up the bottle to check the ingredients and bam, dimethicone. \nWhy my stylist ever recommended this is beyond me. \nI do not recommend this product for wavies at all. \nYour hair will look beautiful at first but die a slow ignominious death. I've kicked this to the curb and found a better mousse that's more curly girl approved.\nNow I'm fixing the damage that this product did.\nAlso, if you're a blonde or brunette this product will color bleach your hair in the sun or with heat. I'm still not sure why based on the ingredients but I'm a natural blonde and didn't have to use any of my go blonder spray when I was a hermit in the AC during the time I used this product.",
