It doesn't smear and somehow comes off so easily when I wash my makeup off it is truly a mascara dream. For my girlies who like more dramatic look I wouldn't recommend this one, but for my naturals this should be your go to.",

I was excited to try this one because I like to compare all the tubing masacaras on the market and GrandeWrap has me so confused. I like the wand and how precise you can get in the inner corner and the bristles give good separation at first. The formula of the mascara however is extremely wet. In order to see length I have to let each coat *almost* dry before applying another one which isn't ideal for someone who is always in a rush. Once I get to about my fifth coat (which in my opion is way too many to be able to achieve the look im going for) the lashes start to clump together because of the excessive product. I was really hoping for more out of this product and will be sticking to my Tartelette XL tubing mascara.",

Unlike traditional mascaras, this formula uses tubing technology, which means it wraps around each lash for incredible definition and length—without clumping or flaking throughout the day.\n\nOne of the biggest perks is its smudge-proof and water-resistant wear. I have oily eyelids, and most mascaras tend to smudge under my eyes, but this one stays put all day without any raccoon-eye effect. Despite its longevity, removal is a breeze—just warm water and a gentle massage, and the tubes slide right off, no harsh rubbing or makeup remover needed!\n\nI also appreciate the ProVitamin B5 in the formula, which helps condition and strengthen my lashes over time. The wand evenly coats each lash, providing a natural yet noticeable lift and length. If you're looking for a mascara that delivers definition, durability, and easy removal, GrandeWRAP Tubing Mascara is definitely worth trying!",

        "comments": "I have mixed emotions about this mascara. I absolutely love tubing mascaras. So much so that its the only kind of mascara I use anymore. I was excited to try this one because I like to compare all the tubing masacaras on the market and GrandeWrap has me so confused. I like the wand and how precise you can get in the inner corner and the bristles give good separation at first. The formula of the mascara however is extremely wet. In order to see length I have to let each coat *almost* dry before applying another one which isn't ideal for someone who is always in a rush. Once I get to about my fifth coat (which in my opion is way too many to be able to achieve the look im going for) the lashes start to clump together because of the excessive product. I was really hoping for more out of this product and will be sticking to my Tartelette XL tubing mascara.",
