No eyeshadow even needed. I decided to purchase it, and I was disappointed to see it was just a flat color. I remember it to be a beautiful rose/plum color with a bit of shimmer. In fact, in the product photo here, it looks like it has shimmer... like it did back in the 80's. Did Clinique change the color and not update the product photo?",

If you buy a shade near your skin color, it won't distort the color of your eye shadow, but it will keep it from creasing or smearing for literally days, if need be. Whenever I sleep over at a friend's house and don't take my makeup off, my eye makeup still looks great the next morning. I bought this as a gift for my cousin and now she is addicted, too.",

If it is that big of a seller, why would you discontinue it?? Terrible marketing in my opinion! And obviously others also. I have been a loyal Clinique customer for 30 years, this is happening more and more every time I go in, you guys changing colors on me. I�m almost ready to quit using your product!!!
