Seriously, it's like a drink of water. If I'm feeling a little dry after using actives, I add a little of the ilia base face Milk, and they play so well together.

After applying it, my face feels calmer, moisturized, and plump. Visually, my skin was radiant! No dry spots, a bouncy plumpness, and less redness. The ingredients are really nice for me. This would go best for oily skin types I believe. Personally, the ultra rich moisturizer suits my really dry skin better during the winter, but the formula of this gel cream is perfect for me for summer days when I am less dry and want a lighter formula. I love barrier support and this gives me that. Love it!",

        "comments": "Unfortunately, my favorite moisturizer that I've been using for years has been discontinued (the Coconut Water Cream Moisturizer), so I decided to try FAB's new moisturizer and it's awful (for me). I have very oily skin in the spring and summer, and normal skin with dry patches at times in the fall and winter. I also suffer from acne. When I read that this is supposed to be lightweight, breathable, and non-oily, I thought it would be a great replacement but I was incredibly wrong. It's heavy and extremely oily. I only used a dime-size amount for my entire face and neck but even that felt like way too much! It never fully absorbed into my skin and I cannot stand the feeling of a greasy product sitting on my face. This will most likely be perfect for those with super dry skin but this isn't the one for the oily fam! FAB, PLEASE BRING BACK THE COCONUT WATER CREAM!!! PLEASE!!! IT'S THE ONLY MOISTURIZER THAT HAS WORKED FOR ME FOR 6 YEARS!!! :(",

        "comments": "I recently tried the First Aid Beauty Hydrating Dewy Gel Cream Moisturizer, and it has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine. Here's my breakdown of why I love it: The texture is light, cooling, and refreshing. It has a gel-cream consistency that feels like a burst of hydration as soon as it hits the skin. It absorbs quickly without leaving any greasy or sticky residue, making it perfect for day use or under makeup. The combination of hyaluronic acid and ceramides provides a powerful moisture boost that leaves my skin feeling plump, soft, and nourished. My skin tends to get dry, especially during colder months, and this moisturizer has been a game-changer in keeping my skin hydrated throughout the day. True to its name, the \"dewy\" effect is real! It gives my complexion a natural, healthy glow without making it look shiny or oily. I've noticed that my skin appears more radiant, with a smooth finish. I have combination skin, and I've found this product to be gentle yet effective. It doesn't clog my pores or feel heavy, so I believe it could work for a variety of skin types, from dry to oily, especially if you're looking for hydration without the heaviness of a cream. The scent is very subtle and pleasant, not overpowering, which is great for those with sensitive skin or noses. Overall, the First Aid Beauty Hydrating Dewy Gel Cream is a fantastic, lightweight moisturizer that delivers on hydration, smoothness, and a dewy glow. It's a great option for anyone looking for an everyday moisturizer that's both effective and soothing. If you have dry or dehydrated skin, I highly recommend giving it a try!",

I have very oily skin in the spring and summer, and normal skin with dry patches at times in the fall and winter. I also suffer from acne. When I read that this is supposed to be lightweight, breathable, and non-oily, I thought it would be a great replacement but I was incredibly wrong. It's heavy and extremely oily. I only used a dime-size amount for my entire face and neck but even that felt like way too much! It never fully absorbed into my skin and I cannot stand the feeling of a greasy product sitting on my face. This will most likely be perfect for those with super dry skin but this isn't the one for the oily fam! FAB, PLEASE BRING BACK THE COCONUT WATER CREAM!!! PLEASE!!! IT'S THE ONLY MOISTURIZER THAT HAS WORKED FOR ME FOR 6 YEARS!!! :(",
