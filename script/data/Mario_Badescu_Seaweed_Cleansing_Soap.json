        "comments": "If you're looking for a cleanser that does its job well, this is not it. I was very hopeful to try out a Mario Badescu product, but after trying this cleanser, I won't purchase anything else. This specifically says it cleanses deep and removes any makeup. This is sadly not true at all. I thought it was just bad at removing my foundation, and I was semi okay with that. But then we had a huge storm roll through and I spent a make up free Saturday outside cleaning the yard. Thought for sure there would be no residue when after using this cleanser since I hadn't put on a single drop of make up. I cleansed three times with this cleanser (got used to doing this to go through it quick instead of throwing away and in hopes it would help cleanse my make up off better, it doesn't) in the shower then dried and applied my toner as usual. And I was DISGUSTED seeing all the dirt coming off of my face onto my cotton pad while applying my toner. That was a huge eye opener. Ran straight to my nearest Ulta to find a better replacement that would actually clean my face. I was baffled at the ineffectiveness of this product, to say the least.",

I was breaking out really bad in my early 30's and literally bought hundreds of dollars worth of cleansers, acne medication, dermatologist appointments. Then I went on Mario's website and I filled out a questionnaire about my skin and this was the cleanser that was recommend (also the Aloe Moisturizer). They sent me free samples in the mail of different products and for the past 3 years I've used nothing but this cleanser, the Aloe moisturizer and the buffering lotion for the occasional pimple. My acne has yet to return. And the buffering lotion takes care of the occasional pimple I get once a month. Try going on their website, I promise you won't be disappointed with this brand!",

After using about half of the bottle, it did develop an almost fishy odor. I wasn't a big fan of the original scent when I first opened it, which was a floral, mature woman kind of smell. It was not especially moisturizing but did not bother my sensitive skin either.",
