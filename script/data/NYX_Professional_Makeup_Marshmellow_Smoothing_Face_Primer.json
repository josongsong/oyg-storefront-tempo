        "comments": "This product smells. A lot. As do most NYX products. I don't really appreciate that in something that's going to be sitting on my face all day. The texture is really gloopy and sticky. It doesn't dry down and feels really greasy. I had wanted a silicone based primer to go with my silicone based foundation. This did not smooth out my makeup in any way. It made my foundation look really fuzzy and bumpy, like I was growing mold. Didn't help with longevity in any way. If anything, it felt like my foundation came off faster because of this grease.",
