I love that you can use it as a sheer powder or build for more coverage, but it really evens my skin tone out nicely without being heavy. I would recommend buying in store if you're not sure on color, I would consider myself to have warm toned skin but in Estee Lauder products my best matches are all in their cool toned range (I was actually shocked).",

I feel like they're doing it to try to catch up with all the other powders and they've just made it worse because it's not free of anything Never in my life have I ever had pimples on my face. I am a very long time loyal Estée Lauder customer. I just went to purchase more because I was out in love and behold totally broke my face out really bad. Had to go to the doctor. I should be reimbursed. I am stopping all Estée Lauder products unfortunately that makes me sad. I have to start all over to find something I can trust I do not recommend this product. After using for a week, I broke out and I've stopped using it and I'm still breaking out and after research they have ref formulated this in April 2025.",

The formula is silky and smooth, gliding onto the skin effortlessly and giving an airbrushed matte finish that still looks natural. It instantly blurs imperfections, evens out my skin tone, and gives me a polished look without ever feeling heavy or cakey. What really makes it stand out is the staying power — this foundation truly lives up to the \"stay-in-place\" promise. I've worn it through long workdays, outdoor events, and even during hot, humid weather, and it holds up beautifully without oxidizing or breaking apart. I also love that it works just as well on its own as it does layered over my liquid foundation when I want more coverage. It doesn't settle into lines or emphasize texture, and it keeps my T-zone shine-free without drying out other areas. The compact is elegant, lightweight, and comes with a mirror, making it perfect for keeping in my bag for touch-ups throughout the day (though, to be honest, I rarely need to touch up). I just wish it wasn't sold out so often — that's how amazing it is. If you can get your hands on it, do it. This has become a holy grail product for me, and I don't see myself switching anytime soon.",

However, as the day has worn on, this afternoon it has turned darker and has given me more color. Perhaps it's the tint others have complained of, of being orange. I don't see it as orange-tinted but it definitely turned darker. In this case, it's a good thing I guess. \n\nI also did not receive the two sided applicator as stated and I checked everywhere for it as I had also ordered lipstick and received the freebies that came with my order. I used a makeup brush which was okay but I guess I need to go get a washable sponge so that I can press it on instead of brushing it on. It took quite a bit of brushing on as I was being careful to not over-do it.\n\nI'm 74 so I have my share of wrinkles and the larger pores that come with aging. I will give it credit that it doesn't seem to emphasize the wrinkles or settle into them much and it does seem to help mitigate the pores. However, using a light touch with the Double Wear foundation and a light puffing of my pearl powders on top achieves the same result. \n\nI do like having a light, easy way to put some color on my face and cover some of the marks of uneven coloration of my skin, especially if I'm not going out for the day but still want to look presentable when I walk my dog in the morning. I'm not sure that this will be the answer and I will likely try some other brands once I run out of this although I will go to the counter to figure out colors and see what the coverage might be. I do hope that they don't change the formula for their foundation. It's perfect as it is.",
