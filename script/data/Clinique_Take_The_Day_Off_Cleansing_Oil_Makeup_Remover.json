It does what it claims to do. It removes make up. But it will NOT remove eye makeup, as in mascara, or concealer/foundation around the eye area. It will NOT remove all the make up on ur skin either. So if ur wearing medium-heavy make up you might want to finish off with a make up wipe. I expected more for the price point.",

I've tried other brands such as Farmacy's Green Clean which although it worked well, it caused a painful stye in my eye which i had to have treated by my eye doctor. He said he's seen women have this issue due to makeup or cleansers. I use several pumps which I rub in, then add warm water, rinse, and fully wipe it off with a wet makeup eraser. I also use a gentle water based eye makeup remover for more stubborn eyeliner which is why I'm only giving 4 stars. It doesn't remove all eye makeup unless you don't use much. I'd recommend this.",

Twice, it has come about 1/4-1/3 empty with oil spilled all over the packaging! It's an absolute mess because of Ulta's way of shipping it. They don't secure the pump and put it in a very thin mailer. Not how a cleansing oil should be shipped. I received a refund both times but it was suggested to me by customer service to 'only purchase this product in stores from now on'. Yeah I will, BUT the packaging for shipping still needs to improve on Ulta's end.",

It removes my eye makeup pretty well but i do have to admit i still have a little residue under my eyes from eye liner. I used this before I actually cleanse though so it works perfectly for me. I do have acne prone skin but this doesn't appear to break me out thankfully. Don't be scared of the liquidity of this, I just pump in into my cupped palm and rub my hands together then put on my dry face and I don't get it anywhere.",
