I picked this up along with several other dermalogica products and have been using them for 4 months. I wanted to use it for a while before reviewing. This is probably my favorite dermalogica product. It works well for my skin type. It's a light, fragrance free moisturizer. Doesn't irritate my skin. I use it daily. The downside is obviously the cost. I do get dry patches on my skin from time to time that I have to use a heavier moisturizer on, but daily use this is a great product.",

        "comments": "This is the 1st product I have ever reviewed in my life, but it is so good I just had to write this one. At the age of 44 after trying almost every eye product on the market I had resigned myself to the fact that the dark circles around my eyes were something I would just have to live with, everything I have ever tried in the past made not even the slightest bit of difference. I also have really sensitive eyes and wear contact lenses and as such a lot of products make my eyes really red and sore. After reading some amazing reviews on the Internet I decided to give Dermalogica a go and got a few samples of the various products to try out. Two of the samples were this one (age reversal eye complex) and the Power firm. I tried the Power Firm sample first and although it was a lovely product to use and it did reduce some of the fine lines around my eyes I didn't notice any difference to my dark circles. Before the Power Firm sample ran out I decided to try the Eye Complex. This cream is so gentle, it didn't effect my eyes at all, even though I started using it twice every day and not every other day as recommended. I must admit that during the first couple of days of using it I didn't really notice a difference in my eyes at all, however on the 3rd day after waking up I looked in the mirror and actually said out loud 'Oh My God!' I could not believe it - my dark circles were really diminished and my eyes in general looked so much tighter and, well, just younger. Even though I had only had about 6 hours sleep and quite a few drinks the night before I looked fresh as a daisy, just as if I had had 10 hours sleep. Actually my eyes don't ever look this good no matter how much beauty sleep I get! It's been a week now and I am not joking, every day my eyes seem to be looking younger and younger and the dark circles are now virtually gone. The one little sample has only just run out as you only need a small amount for each eye, it really goes a long long way. I can't stop looking in the mirror, yes I know that sounds really vain but after all these years of trying rubbish products that promise the earth I just can't believe I have found something that actually does what it promises. Thank you Dermalogica!!!! I will definately be investing in the full size product of this miracle eye cream.",

You can see a difference immediately following application, as it smooths over the undereye area and evens out skin tone well.
