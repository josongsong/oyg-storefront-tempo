I hate to tell you the color that I like because I know that they'll discontinue it or I'll never be able to find it again, but the best color I found is called pushed up! It's fabulous as it's just a little bit darker than your lip color so it's very enhancing but not over the top!!\nThank you, NYX lingerie for this wonderful product!",

If you have a deep skin tone and struggle to find a nude that doesn't lean too brown or wash you out, the shade \"Low Cut\" is a total game-changer. It has a beautiful pink undertone that adds just the right balance of warmth and brightness without looking ashy or overly bold.\n\nThe formula is incredible - dries down super fast, doesn't crack or flake, and feels incredibly lightweight. You honestly forget you're wearing anything at all. And the staying power? Unreal. I wore it through meals, drinks, and even overnight just to test it / and it did not budge. You could literally go two days without reapplying, and it still looks fresh. Highly recommend?",

Nice, but twice the price of this formula.  \n\nI applied the lipstick,  wore it through beans,  rice, veggies and a ginger ale with no effort to spare my lip color, and fell asleep during a movie. It was still intact after 12 hours of wear, with no checking, flaking, or touch up. I'm amazed. \n\nMake sure lips are exfoliated and prepared, like any matte lip, and hydrate afterwards. \n\nI ordered a couple of colors to try. I'm partial to the MAC 90's browns and brick,  but I'm now allergic. These are the perfect pigments with a formula update.",

The second one is #22 and it's the complete opposite. It's very thick and not as smooth to apply as #30. With the brown shade, I was able to apply a little with full coverage the red one is not the same. I was very excited to try this product because they're vegan. I am now a little skeptical about purchasing another shade.",
