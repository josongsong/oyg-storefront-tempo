I've tried all sorts of tricks: soap brows, wax, other brow gels and they would move and / or the product would flake. It made me look like my eyebrows had dandruff! I don't do my brows every day and for years I didn't wear make-up but perhaps a handful of times a year so finding the right product wasn't a priority. In the last couple of years that has changed and I'm so glad I found this product. I used NYX eyebrow wax for years just because I tended to only use drugstore brands. \n\nThis product is worth the price tag. A little goes a long way. It's super glue for your brows!",

        "comments": "This was my first time using a brow setter, so it was a completely new experience for me. I enjoyed that it did stay clear and didn't flake. You could barely tell I was wearing it, except for if you look closely, it would look a bit shiny in places where I applied a bit too much. But overall, it wasn't noticeable. It didn't feel crunchy if I applied an even, light coat. However, I applied more towards my inner brows, so it felt a bit crunchy there. I felt it did a better job at lasting longer when I applied it to my bare brows (held up pretty good after 16 hours and withstood a nap) compared to when I applied it over another brow product (Benefit Brow Microfilling Pen). Since I've never used a gel brow setter before, I struggled with how much I should apply the first few times. It also dries very quickly! Near my inner brows, I applied a bit more to control those hairs and realized it dried much quicker than I expected, so it was already hardened before I got the shaped look/setting of my brow hairs that I wanted. I enjoyed the packaging of it and the two different lengths of bristles on the wand! However, I personally didn't notice too much of a difference from before applying it to my brows and after. I don't think my brows are too unruly to begin with, so this product isn't a necessity for me. Nonetheless, it still does hold well enough (especially on bare brows) and extremely well if you apply a lot (though it will feel stiff if you apply too much).",
