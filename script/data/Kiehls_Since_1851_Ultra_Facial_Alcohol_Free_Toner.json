I've used every toner from the drug store to department store for decades and they all ended up too either too harsh, overly drying, or did nothing at all. \niv used the ordinary 7% glycolic acid and when my skin needs some good intensive  exfoliating ( which is a great, inexpensive product) but that's once maybe twice a month and at night only! \nthe rest of the year I use this toner! its reduced my redness significantly imo ! doesn't burn / sting or leave me feeling stripped! \n\nP's. a little goes along way and be careful when applying to cotton pad it can come out fast causing wasted products !",

The liquid is not thick at all, and I just pat it on my face to help push it in my pores. I use 2-3 different toners on my face each time, and the products vary depending on the season. I use this during the fall and winter months. I highly recommend this if you want a little boost of moisture.

I noticed my skin was starting its yearly transition with the weather getting colder and knew I had to switch to something more moisturizing. I picked up the Ultra Facial Cleanser to replace my summer time Acai Damage Minimizing Cleanser along with this Ultra Facial Toner. I already use the Ultra Facial Cream during the colder months. I am really in love with this toner. The texture is very unique and has a thicker, sort of droplet type texture. For this reason, I use cotton pads instead of cotton balls to catch the product. This toner really helps with dryness and is the anti-thesis of what you would get with an alcohol toner. It does not dry my skin out in the least. Instead my face feels hydrated and the combination of all the Ultra Facial products together have sent the dryness away. Also, the small blemishes I had on my forehead cleared up with-in a week. The toner especially seems to help with shine and lessening the appearance of my pores. I have never really used toners regularly but I am really loving this toner and I am making it a permanent part of my routine. Perhaps this will not work for everyone, since skin varies so greatly. But for my seasonal skin changes, it works like a charm.",
