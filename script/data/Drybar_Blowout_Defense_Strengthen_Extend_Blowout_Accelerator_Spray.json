When I tried the Blowout Defense gifted by drybar, it completely changed my routine and the way my hair looks. From the very first application, I noticed my hair felt softer, more manageable, and with significantly less frizz. I love that it provides heat protection, so I don't have to worry about damage from the blow dryer or about layering too many products that end up making my hair greasy faster.\nWhen it comes to the blowout, I was impressed with how long my hairstyles lasted—especially since my hair is wavy and tends to frizz and tangle throughout the day. But with this product, my hair stayed intact, full of volume, and looked fresh and natural for much longer. Plus, it has a delicious scent that makes it even more perfect. It has definitely become a must-have in my routine.",

When I tried the Blowout Defense gifted by drybar, it completely changed my routine and the way my hair looks. From the very first application, I noticed my hair felt softer, more manageable, and with significantly less frizz. I love that it provides heat protection, so I don't have to worry about damage from the blow dryer or about layering too many products that end up making my hair greasy faster.\nWhen it comes to the blowout, I was impressed with how long my hairstyles lasted—especially since my hair is wavy and tends to frizz and tangle throughout the day. But with this product, my hair stayed intact, full of volume, and looked fresh and natural for much longer. Plus, it has a delicious scent that makes it even more perfect. It has definitely become a must-have in my routine.",

It made my hair so sticky, stiff and unmanageable. It didn't \"extend\" my blowout, in fact I had to wash 2 days sooner.\nI typically love all things DryBar. This is a huge miss though.\nDont waste your money.",
