        "comments": "This balm is a thinner consistency compared to the Ole Henriksen which is my holy grail, so it's a flexible as both an overnight treatment and over a lip combo in the daytime. This is the only other lip balm I use aside from my Ole Henriksen; everything else has been been left in the dust. I specifically go for this when I don't need to commit to a heavy duty lip treatment but still want my lips nourished and feeling slick and smooth instead of sticky. I got it four shades, but I gravitate towards natural shades like Be Real and Be Powerful since the pigment would separate in Be Bold and Be You and occasionally settle into my lip creases. I was really surprised at how much I ended up loving Be Powerful. It was so unassuming but is now easily my favorite shade. If you're debating shades like I did (I ended up buying all of them), I would 100% repurchase Be Real and Be Powerful, and it is so refreshing that cocokind has made it a priority to sell high quality products at a reasonable price. I'm proud to support Cocokind, and the hype is well-deserved!",

The moisurizing effects are phenominal.\n\nBUT, all of a sudden it smelled like fungus or bacteria! I went for a second swipe after a few hours and it was REVOLTING. Trying to understand what happened, i think it has something to do with the product design and air getting into the tube? (I'm probably wrong). \n\nI am so dissappinted, the product is marked to last for 12 months, and I've only had it for 5 :(",

        "comments": "I absolutely love this lip blur balm. It feels like a combination of a lip balm and a lip gloss, both of which I love to use!!. I'm so happy I got one of these before they sold out. The soft pink is lovely and the formula is so soothing and hydrating on my lips. The only reason I knocked off a star is because when I received it in the mail, the formula was separated a little bit (I know this could have probably been going through hot and cold climates in shipping) and it took a while to get the formula to mix again. \n\nI know Priscilla talked about how much product is in the tube on instagram and TikTok, but I have to agree with the people that say it feels like there isn't a lot of product in the tube. When I push the product up to the top of the tube to get some out, it feels like the tube is empty and like there is hardly anything in there. \nI appreciate the transparency of Cocokind SOO much and I'm willing to overlook this as they said they are willing to adjust for the future lippies. \nWith that said, I would absolutely LOVE if Cocokind came out with a shimmery lip blur balm and maybe even some scented/flavored ones for those of us who don't have sensitive skin on their lips. I have been following Cocokind for quite some time now and I have loved seeing their growth over the years. Their skincare is the only one I use and the only one I've gotten to work for me. PLEASE CONTINUE TO MAKE NEW PRODUCTS!!!!! : ) < 3",

        "comments": "I do not self identify as someone with sensitive skin and have never had an allergic reaction to any product but this was a first. It took me a minute to realize it was from this product. I noticed cheilitis being induced after using this but wearing a retainer usually causes this anyway. Then i rubbed off some excess balm on my hand and then noticed my hand started itching in that exact spot to the point that it created open sores. My mouth now looks like i have herpes and my hand is still red and sensitive where i wiped off the excess. Does this product need to be recalled and that's why they keep having sales on it? It's also not a true balm. Its a gloss. I got one for my husband who always misplaces his balms and he said he felt like lil mama bc his lip gloss was poppin. It does not calm down my chapped lips but irritates my skin around my lips. Very strange since it claims to be formulated for sensitive skin and i dont even have sensitive skin. Maybe itll work for others but i may have to return every color i got. Hope they come out with a better balmy non rash inducing formula in the future bc the keychain aspect is dope. Or hopefully others start jumping on the keychain cap bandwagon to make this the new norm. I thought I could swap out my husband's current balm so he could keep it on his key ring but the cap must be specially made to only fit cocokind balms.",
