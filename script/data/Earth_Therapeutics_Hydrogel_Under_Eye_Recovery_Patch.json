Please note I always keep them in the refrigerator for additional cooling. While the eye patch under the eye is fairly easy to use and applies well, the former circular patches would cover the entire eye and seemed to tighten and lift way better. With this patch being under the eye, the top of the eye does not get the same treatment without using an additional patch, which is pointless. I have not seen nearly the same result, using this under your eye pad and will move on.",

I was a little confused as to why the sticky side would go on the undereye, but then discovered that the gel is on the sticky side for better contact.  Probably not a good idea to leave on more than 30 mins., as sticky side is kind of hard to remove gently.  Still good, affordable product, though.",

I have bought several boxes to add to care packages I have made for my friends and family who work in healthcare, others with chronic illnesses like myself and those who have become new moms during the pandemic. They all love them too.\n\nThe patches are so easy to use. I'm able to put them on easily and not worry about them falling off no matter what I do. After showering/washing my face- I put on my facial lotion and simply skip the area for the patches, put on the patches and leave them on while I can continue on with whatever I need to do. It's normally time to remove the patches by the time I finish my hair and there is a significant difference in the puffiness and an increased brightness under my eyes. I also love the subtle cucumber smell. As someone with chronic illnesses this is such a simple act of self care that I can do for myself that helps me feel and look more human, especially after a long night of feeling unwell.  It also has an easy clean up so I don't have to worry about using more energy. I have long list of allergies along with very sensitive skin but I have no issues with these patches at all! They are definitely worth the price and even more so when they are on sale.",

From long flights to London, India and China, I am often exhausted.  The weather change in other countries is different from the US.  My eyes are tired from flights, constant meetings, to traveling the country sides, to allergies - I have used the pads under my eyes for each purpose.  While these are not 100.00 miracle pads, they are perfect for the price to give you some refresh to your eyes, cooling treatments to take that stress away.  I actually wear these while on the computer or watching tv too and leave them on longer than stated, I even put them on my lips and laugh lines.  No issues for me, just cooling and rejuventating for my busy life.",
