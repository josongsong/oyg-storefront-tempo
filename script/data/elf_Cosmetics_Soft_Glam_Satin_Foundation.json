Face not only looked greasy but like covered in bad spray tan.  Not a good look for glam or office.",

I have large pores and acne/textured skin, so having a natural satiny finish foundation w/o the excess oil looks and feels great for me. I also use a thin layer for my undereyes as concealer on low-effort days, which looks great too! It can also become patchy on dry, flakey spots on skin too, so be aware and stay hydrated prior. It won't work for everyone, but I love this foundation, especially for its price nowadays compared to other foundations!",

I didn't think satin works on my skin cus of how oily my skin gets. This foundation last a good 8-9 hrs which is prefect for work. When my oils do come out, it isn't alot, almost slightly dewy. It's a buildable coverage and combine with the huda beauty setting powder is the best combo. Not really a con for me but anyone else. the warm shades can lean more yellow. I have yellow/olive tone soo the shade match is a plus.",

I recommend putting in more than 1 (if you have more than 1) shade / brand that's already a good match. The chart returned 25 Neutral or 31 Neutral fot the ones I put in. I went w/31 Neutral (I wear CN 52 Neutral in Clinique) and it is perfect. \nAs I've been doing fo a couple weeks now, I used the elf putty primer just in my nose area. I used a brush to apply. I did set it w/Bye Bye Pores and I could not stop looking at it all day! It was absolutely flawless! It \"wore\" beautifully, even in our 110 Vegas summer heat. I did touch up just a teensy bit around my mouth myafter I ate. \nMy skin looks flawless and it looks and feels like my skin but better. Really! I'm truly stunned at this elf soft glam satin foundation!",

        "comments": "During application, I noticed it immediately setting into the creases of my under eye area. After 4 hours of wear in a cold office, it wasn't just patchy. There were large spots missing foundation. I do have texture on my forehead, which got the worst of it, but everywhere else was also ruined. Besides the look, it made my skin feel dry while also still being satin-y enough to slide around my skin even after setting. I suppose it *feels* like satin but definitely doesn't look like it. Maybe someone with normal/oily skin could make this work, but the only other foundations that have similar reactions are the super matte finish ones.",
