I feel like it helped with volume as well. The scent is really good. I'm really glad I found this product.",

The back of the bottle also has large warnings about the product's flammability so i would be careful using heat styling after putting this on the hair.",

        "comments": "I have super thick, coarse, naturally dry and wavy hair. I'm crazy about both Kenra and Color Wow for my hair. I already use a couple of leave ins plus Kenra Blow Dry Spray. So I decided not to change anything from my normal routine, but just ADD this. WOW!!! It's amazing!!! Plus it smells great!!! \nThe first 2 times I used this, I blow dried my hair instead of letting it air dry. This is amazing for a blow dry!!! My hair is super soft and silky!!! It stayed soft and held the style day after day after day … EVEN with spraying it w/Bed Head Masterpiece Extra Strong Hold every day!!! I know! It sounds like I am making this up!!! But I am a freak when it comes to my hair! It's so heavy I have to use a strong hold hairspray to keep it lifted all day … and I can't stand it feeling dry, tangley, or like it has product in it. But my hair looked as good - or better - as the day I washed it - every day!!! I curled it again every morning. Each day I thought: I'll need to shampoo tomorrow … on the SIXTH day I FINALLY washed it again!!!\nSo this time I let it air dry. My hair stays damp underneath or in the middle for several hours … but not w/THIS Crême! It was COMPLETELY dry all the way thru in less than 2 hours. It's super soft snd it smells SO GOOD!!! \nI use a tiny amount for all my hair … between a pea size and a dime size. I flip my head over, work it thru, then today I just scrunched it into place. Super cute! Super soft! Great hold! No sticky, crunchy, or heavy product feel. I honestly cannot feel any thing in my hair. It feels better than w/no product!",

It is the best I have found for accentuating the waves. I just put a quarter size dollop into my long hair, scrunch, paying attention not to disturb the waves and I like to focus on my crown to give my waves some height. Then, I finish off by scrunching with hair spray, and I am done!  With second day hair, I just rinse hair in shower and reapply my steps. Love this! Never really felt like I could embrace my waviness until air dry creme!",

I have fine, slightly wavy, frizzy hair and an oily scalp. This helps cut down on the frizz, enhances my wave a bit, and reduces drying time by maybe 20 minutes for me. It doesn't feel like anything is in my hair, and doesn't make my hair greasy. It helps give a little volume on the first use, but you really need to use a shampoo with sulfates to prevent build-up. Otherwise the silicone in this product does start to weigh very fine hair down. I prefer sulfate-free shampoo, so the fact that it starts weighing down after one use is an issue for me.\n\nOverall, I like it and will probably buy it again when I run out.",

I  combed my hair all the way from root to tip as I normally do.\r\nAfter my hair was completely dry. I used my hot hair styler. I Will say that I do believe that it helps to style faster and easier. So that I did not have to use the hot tool for very long.\r\nMy hair stays soft and no frizzy at all.",

I have fine, thinning hair so my hair dries quickly already so I wasn't sure what to expect when using the Kenra Professional Air Dry Crème 6. I did not notice a difference in drying time. It also says it helps with frizz and body. There might have been a little less frizz but I don't feel like this really did anything for me. On the plus side it also didn't weigh my hair down or make it crunchy. It really is like there in nothing in my hair at all. It is early spring so it isn't humid yet in Ohio, so maybe this would work better as a summer product, but for now I have to say it isn't for me. It might be better for those with thicker hair.",
