You have to use so much to cover your face, it feels so light that you dont even think youre doing anything, it doesnt foam which is just my personal problem with it, and after I wash my face twice with it, theres still tons of dirt on my face when I wipe it with a face towel. I legit think this is the worst cleanser I have ever used. Its useless. Please spend your money on the Tula probiotic cleanser instead.",

My skin is so finicky, and I am almost 60, so I've tried A LOT of facial cleansers. This minimizes pores better than anything I've ever used- it really cleanses the skin well (I use a washcloth with it). There is zero irritation or dryness, and no scent at all. I actually like a fresh scent, but I realize that can irritate some people's skin. This is a fabulous product, and I highly recommend.",

I have tried ALL the cleansers & products out there, in search of something both gentle & with the right ingredients that won't contribute to breakouts. Most products left my skin so sensitive and tender! The micellar cleanser is great, even for eye makeup. It is as effective as bioderma sensitive formula, which I have used for many years.The cleanser is the ONLY one I have tried that does not hurt my skin. It does clean thoroughly but I find its texture a bit difficult to work with, as it turns watery and milky very quickly, making it hard to decipher where I have spread it on my face while washing. I do not love the texture. The moisturizer is the best I have ever tried- it is perfect for both day & night as it is so hydrating but lightweight! The moisturizer is my favorite product from Dore. The baume is great- i never need it on my facial skin but I do love it for my lips and cuticles! I also love that Dore sent me the cheek balm from Merit because it is amazing, my new fav beauty product! None of these products cause acne for my reactive skin and they work perfectly with my tretinoin, which I use to manage breakouts and general skin health. I will certainly be a repeat customer :-)",

I tried this cleanser in their starter kit and I must say it's truly fragrance free and as natural as you can get. I have VERY hypersensitive, hyper reactive skin. I am falsey allergic to many things due to how sensitive my skin is. My skin is also very dry, year round (I live in Massachusetts of the U.S. for weather example). I like how light and gentle this cleanser is, however it is even more drying for my skin. Despite using the moisturizer, my skin is left very taut and tight. Disappointed.",
