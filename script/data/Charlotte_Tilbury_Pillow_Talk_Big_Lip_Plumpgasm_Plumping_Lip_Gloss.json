The tester in the store was a mess, with lip product all over the lip and side of the container. I thought it was due to customers sloppy use - nope. Even using care when removing the applicator, the suction causes a mess to come out. Too bad, because I like the lip product but not the method of dispensing it!",

        "comments": "The Charlotte Tilbury Lip Plumper gloss in the shade 'pillow talk' has quickly become a staple in my makeup collection. I have tried many lip plumpers in the past that have done nothing, but I have to say, Charlotte Tilbury knocked this one out the park! \n\nFirst off, upon opening, it is a beautiful & uniquely made, high-quality packaging, with a cute lips logo on there. The application is also perfect, providing just the right amount of product without being too messy.  The gloss has a smooth and creamy texture that glides on effortlessly, making it perfect for everyday wear. The color is a gorgeous muted rosy nude that complements my skin tone perfectly. I immediately felt a tingling sensation on my lips. It wasn't uncomfortable, but rather a subtle plumping sensation. I could see a noticeable difference in the fullness of my lips within minutes. \n\nWhat I love most about this lip plumping gloss is that it not only enhances my natural lip shape, but it also adds a hint of fullness and volume. It's like a non-invasive lip filler in a tube! One of the main ingredients in this gloss is hyaluronic acid, which is known for its hydrating and plumping properties. I have also noticed that my lips feel more moisturized and smoother after using this product. I have received many compliments on my lips since using this gloss.\n\nThe best part is that it doesn't dry out my lips like some other plumping products do. Instead, it leaves them feeling hydrated and nourished thanks to the nourishing ingredients such as coconut oil and shea butter. \n\nAdditionally, I also appreciate that it is cruelty-free and made with natural ingredients, which is a huge plus for me. \n\nThe only downside to this product is that it is a bit on the pricier side, but I believe it is worth the investment. A little goes a long way and the results make it worth the price.\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this lip plumping gloss to anyone looking for fuller and more hydrated lips. I have received countless compliments on my lips since using this product and I can confidently say that it has become a must-have in my daily makeup routine. Plus, the sleek and elegant packaging makes it a chic addition to my makeup collection. It's by far the nicest gloss packaging I have ever owned. Overall, the Charlotte Tilbury Lip Plumper gloss in pillow talk has exceeded all of my expectations and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for fuller, more luscious lips. I was sent this product complimentary in exchange of my honest review.",

        "comments": "I'm going to preface this review by saying I'm not really a traditional lip gloss person. I like to layer glosses over lipstick but I'm very picky with the consistency. The gooey, thick glosses are not my taste but I know some like it. Having said that, there are definite pros and cons to this Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumpgasm Plumping Lip Gloss. I think the name in and of itself is way too long and descriptive but that's just me being picky. On the plus side, the presentation is gorgeous. It's a very substantial, big tube with a creative flair and you can actually see the color from the see through \"window\" which is nice. The doe tip applicator is perfectly balanced and big enough to swipe a large area. There is a lot of product that comes out when you lift the wand however; a little too much in my opinion. Since this is a lip plumping gloss, you do get a cooling, almost minty fresh effect. It's not overly tingly or uncomfortable like other lip plumpers. As with all plumpers, this gives the illusion of bigger lips using optical enhancers and light reflecting pigment. Your lips don't actually get bigger unfortunately. The scent is amazing; like a luxurious, sweet cotton candy. Even though this is a gooey gloss, it does have staying power which surprised me. I wore this for hours without touch ups. I did wear a nude lip liner as I do with every lip product. I'm wearing the Fair-Medium version. This was just okay for me. I don't think it's something I would run out and buy but I'm thankful I got to try it out.",
