Using a straight up acne cleanser daily dries out my oily skin and makes it oilier. This has been perfect for everyday use withouth overdrying and has become a staple in my skin care routine.",

        "comments": "I rarely write reviews, but this is the best facial cleanser I have ever used. Ever. Cursed with very large, dark, stubborn nose pores and oil slick skin on my face since puberty (thanks dad) and with a couple of weeks using mainly this, my pores are smaller than a pin-head. Completely cleared out. It gently rinses away all oiliness on my skin as well, no over drying. But I feel like it may over dry if you don't have truly OILY skin type. I make sure to exfoliate really well before using this, so it's not wasted on trying to clear away a ton of dead skin and can actually get into my pores and treat them. Magical, gentle stuff for overly oily people who are on the sensitive side. Can't recommend enough.",

        "comments": "Ive been on a constant journey of trying to figure out how to clear my skin from acne and dark spots. I've seen great things about the Cetaphil line and figured I'd give them a try when Ulta had a sale a few weeks ago. I purchased this cleanser and the corresponding moisturizer. The first two weeks were fine, however at the start of week two, my face and neck were itchy all over. I'd never had that kind of reaction before. The next day I had little bumps all over my forehead, cheeks, and neck. Maybe my skin was too sensitive. With thi being my first time trying Cetaphil, I'm skeptical to try an alternative cleanser from this brand.",

I usually use a gentle hydrating cleanser, however I started getting milia bumps due to never being able to exfoliate. my skin has never been able to handle salicylic acid, however it can with this product! I've been using it 5 nights in a row and have not experienced any skin reactions, and have seen improvement in the milia bumps. I immediately follow up with a good moisturizer.",
