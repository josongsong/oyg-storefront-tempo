The reason it turns orange is because it contains Vitamin C, and it's just oxidizing. Mine oxidized even in the opaque bottle, but the formula didn't change. I feel like I might repurchase it just for funsies, but I wouldn't say I'd recommend it. It's pretty basic for the price, and you can probably benefit more from a brand like CeraVe, but it is fun to use.",
