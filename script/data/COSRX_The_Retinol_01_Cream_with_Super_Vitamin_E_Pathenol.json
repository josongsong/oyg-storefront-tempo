        "comments": "I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review thanks to @COSRX and @influenster. I am impressed with the results I have received in just 1 week! I have added this COSRX The Retinol 0.1 Cream to my usual skincare regimen and I'm really shocked with how quickly I noticed improvements! I'm beginning to get some dark circles as I'm nearing the big 4 0 in a couple years and this change in my under eye area and little discoloration has had me really self-conscious, but when I added this retinol cream to my daily skincare regimen I began noticing right away that where I have the troublesome darkness under my eyes and uneven skin tone, the areas have began to brighten a bit and I love the more even skin tone I've noticed recently. I really love the formula because it's so creamy and feels really nice and hydrating immediately after applying it to my face and neck areas. Also this is a great retinol cream to prevent early signs of aging and who doesn't want a miracle formula for this purpose right? This was my first time trying a product from this brand but it definitely won't be the last! I definitely recommend this product to anyone who's in need of a new affordable retinol cream and just doesn't know which one's work or don't work and which one's they can expect to see results with. I am very excited to try more products from COSRX! Thanks so much for this amazing opportunity! #COSRX #dermskincare #influenster #freshfavesvoxbox",

I don't know if it's doing such a great job that it's drawing out my skin because I know retinal can be harsh the 1st couple of weeks you use it. It takes time to build-up your skin to be able to accept. But at the same time I don't know if my skin is just overly sensitive and not doing so well with it so that's why I'm a. Little bit fifty about it definitely we'll keep using it and seeing but I wish it was a little bit more hydrating",
