Each one is fully saturated with product, which means I can cover my entire face and still have enough left to treat my neck and chest. I also really appreciate the thoughtful packaging: the flip-top lid and included tweezers make it easy to keep everything clean and hygienic.\n\nPerformance-wise, these have been such an effortless addition to my nighttime routine. I use them every evening before bed, and they leave my skin feeling refreshed, hydrated, and with a noticeable glow over time. The formula is gentle enough that I think most skin types would benefit, making it not only a great self-care splurge but also a thoughtful gift.\n\nOverall, these pads are a simple, effective way to give your skin some extra attention with very little effort—and the results speak for themselves.",

        "comments": "I've tried a lot of toning and brightening pads over the years, but the Anua Niacinamide 5% + TXA Brightening Pad really stood out to me from the first week I used it. I didn't expect it to become such a staple in my routine, but now it's one of those products I panic about running out of.\nEach pad is generously soaked in essence, so you're never dealing with a half-dry sheet, which is a big deal for me. I've used other brands where the last few pads in the jar are basically useless because they've dried out, but with these, every single pad feels fresh and saturated.\nsoft and smooth application. Works well with sensitive skin \nI decided to start with nighttime use to see how my skin reacted. The first time I swiped one across my face, it felt cooling and instantly hydrating not that tight, tingling feeling you sometimes get from active ingredients. Within seconds, my skin looked a little more awake and fresh, even before I layered on the rest of my routine.\nI struggle with uneven tone, especially some stubborn post-acne marks and a bit of dullness. By day four or five, I started noticing my skin tone looking more even, and the overall texture felt smoother. My cheeks, which tend to look a little blotchy, were noticeably calmer and brighter.\nNiacinamide has always been my go-to for brightening and improving skin barrier health, while Tranexamic acid is amazing for tackling discoloration and stubborn pigmentation. Together, they seem to work in a really balanced way, there's no harshness and no peeling. \nAnother unexpected benefit was how soft my skin started feeling. My overall complexion is brighter, my makeup goes on smoother, and those post-acne spots that usually linger for months have lightened much faster than usual. \nI've experimented with using them in the morning, too, especially on days when I want my skin to look fresh without much effort. They leave this slightly hydrated, plump base that makes my tinted spf looking glowy and nice on the skin \nOverall, I'd describe the Anua Niacinamide 5% + TXA Brightening Pad as one of the most reliable skincare products I've tried in a long time. It delivers visible results without irritation, feels pleasant to use, and fits seamlessly into both morning and evening routines. I'll keep repurchasing it not just for the brightening benefits, but because it keeps my skin balanced, hydrated, and smooth every single day.\nsimple to use, genuinely effective, and perfect for anyone who wants that natural, even-toned glow without harsh side effects.\n\nThis product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review",

My skin felt instantly refreshed and looked noticeably more brighter the next 15 minutes after removing . I've also seen an improvement in my skin's texture, with a new smoothness and a healthy glow. If you are looking for a skincare product that's full of high quality brightening ingredients, please give them a try. Perfect for using on my African American combination skin type.

I've been using these for a couple of weeks now and I can truly say they're incredible! I really appreciate how the packaging has a built-in pair of tweezers so everything stays nice, tidy, and sanitary. I hate dipping my fingers into a jar, so this makes me feel so much better about grabbing the pads.\n\nAs for the pads themselves, they're super soft and feel amazing on my skin. Usually, facial pads like this do an okay job, but these have been such a nice surprise. I love how much product is on each pad too. Whenever I do my skincare, I can use the extra product on my neck and chest, which feels like a little bonus.\n\nI really love this brand's products and I've tried quite a few of them. Their sunscreen is amazing and their face masks are so good too, so I'm really excited to be able to get these at Ulta now. I can't wait to see what other products they come out with so I can add them to my list.\n\nIf you're looking for an easy product to add to your routine, this is a great one. It's perfect for nights when you don't feel like doing a full routine. Sometimes I just wash my face, swipe one of these, and that's it. I wake up with super soft, bright, glowing skin.",

I washed my face with an oil cleanser followed by a cream cleanser, then used these brightening pads. I followed up with either the ANUA rice 70 overnight mask or the peach niacin brightening mask. I saw results after the second use. Now Ive had wax burn on the sides for my face for years and all the vitamin c in the world couldn't help me. These pads are a game changer. They're gentle and effective, exactly what I want in my skincare. I've got to mention the little plastic tweezers that are on the inside of the top. Great way to keep from cross contamination of product. One pad goes a long way because it is saturated with product. You can even see the amount of liquid on the bottom of the jar, so they definitely didn't skim on the quality of the product.",

The moment I swiped one across my face, I felt an instant cooling sensation, making it perfect for a refreshing pick-me-up.\n\nAfter just a week of consistent use, I noticed a remarkable improvement in my skin's texture and tone. The pads helped reduce the appearance of dark spots and gave my complexion a radiant glow. The gentle exfoliation left my skin feeling smoother without any irritation, which is a must for my sensitive skin.\n\nI also appreciate the convenience of these pads—they're travel-friendly and easy to incorporate into my daily routine. Just swipe, and I'm good to go! \n\nMoreover, Anua's commitment to clean ingredients gives me confidence that I'm treating my skin responsibly. Overall, the Anua Niacinamide 5 TXA Brightening Pad is a must-have for anyone looking to enhance their skincare routine. It's effective, refreshing, and delivers visible results. I highly recommend it for a brighter, more even-toned complexion!\n\n*This review was collected as part of a promotion*",

        "comments": "I naturally have dark circles and my under-eye area is usually dry, but the ANUA Niacinamide 5 TXA Brightening Pads work perfectly to target that area. They're super easy to use and give an instant boost of hydration, leaving my skin feeling soft and refreshed. After using them for the first time they maje  my under eyes look brighter, smoother, and more awake. They also help my makeup go on better without settling into dry patches. I always struggle with concealer application due to my under eye being dry. I love how quick and convenient they are, I love the twisters that it includes it make it easier to get the patches. These pads have definitely become a go to in my routine whenever I want to moisturize and give my tired eyes a little glow up.",

        "comments": "As someone with sensitive skin and a long history of battling hyperpigmentation, I'm always hesitant with brightening products—but this Anua Brightening Pad quickly became a staple. The 5% Niacinamide combined with TXA (Tranexamic Acid) worked like magic in calming down my post-acne marks and evening out my skin tone without any irritation. What I appreciate most is how gentle the pads feel—no stinging, no harsh after-effects. I use them after cleansing, and they leave my skin feeling refreshed and hydrated. Over time, my dark spots have visibly faded, and my complexion looks more radiant and balanced. For anyone struggling with pigmentation but afraid of aggressive formulas, this pad is a game-changer.",

I didn't expect it to become such a staple in my routine, but now it's one of those products I panic about running out of.\nEach pad is generously soaked in essence, so you're never dealing with a half-dry sheet, which is a big deal for me. I've used other brands where the last few pads in the jar are basically useless because they've dried out, but with these, every single pad feels fresh and saturated.\nsoft and smooth application. Works well with sensitive skin \nI decided to start with nighttime use to see how my skin reacted. The first time I swiped one across my face, it felt cooling and instantly hydrating not that tight, tingling feeling you sometimes get from active ingredients. Within seconds, my skin looked a little more awake and fresh, even before I layered on the rest of my routine.\nI struggle with uneven tone, especially some stubborn post-acne marks and a bit of dullness. By day four or five, I started noticing my skin tone looking more even, and the overall texture felt smoother. My cheeks, which tend to look a little blotchy, were noticeably calmer and brighter.\nNiacinamide has always been my go-to for brightening and improving skin barrier health, while Tranexamic acid is amazing for tackling discoloration and stubborn pigmentation. Together, they seem to work in a really balanced way, there's no harshness and no peeling. \nAnother unexpected benefit was how soft my skin started feeling. My overall complexion is brighter, my makeup goes on smoother, and those post-acne spots that usually linger for months have lightened much faster than usual. \nI've experimented with using them in the morning, too, especially on days when I want my skin to look fresh without much effort. They leave this slightly hydrated, plump base that makes my tinted spf looking glowy and nice on the skin \nOverall, I'd describe the Anua Niacinamide 5% + TXA Brightening Pad as one of the most reliable skincare products I've tried in a long time. It delivers visible results without irritation, feels pleasant to use, and fits seamlessly into both morning and evening routines. I'll keep repurchasing it not just for the brightening benefits, but because it keeps my skin balanced, hydrated, and smooth every single day.\nsimple to use, genuinely effective, and perfect for anyone who wants that natural, even-toned glow without harsh side effects.\n\nThis product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review",

        "comments": "In this jar, there are thin small cloth(?) pads that are half moon shape and about twice the size of an eye pad, as well as a plastic tweezer to help pick them up with. The pads can be used to swipe the serum on the skin , wear two under the eyes (on either side) , or just spot wear on a problem area. As I've been noticing texture and larger pores on my cheeks in the front , I opted to try to wear them there - like large eye pads. These can be worn like a face mask for 10-20 minutes. I use niacinamide serum on the regular and tolerate it well , so I attempted to replace the serum with this. It's advertised to be used every day , both am and pm. However, I only wore in the morning. The first day i used for 20 minutes, but the next day my skin irritated and flushed with a slight burn. I waited another day to recover, then tried again, but for only 10 minutes - unfortunately with the same result. I've done this a cycle a few times and my skin looks nice, glowy, and the texture is better. However the irritation may not be worth it. I am not through the whole jar yet, there are 60 pads total; I'll keep trying , but will only use 1-2x a week.  \n\n**This product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review**",
