First and foremost it leaves a white cast on your hair that you have to wash out. You can't brush it out. It does not (!) add lift or volume or texture. It does not (!) add hold or enhance curls. It feels awful. Crunchy sticky brittle. If you try to run your fingers through your hair, you can't. It will just rip your hair out. And you can't sleep on it because the crunch is so loud, it will seriously keep you awake. Don't buy this. Don't buy the hype videos of this giving models bouncy, voluminous hair. They can't possibly be real. I was excited to try some of the other wow products. And for the price? Wow!",

I literally hate this product my fine hair looks so stiff and ugly. my hands and combs go threw so nasty. I have to rewatch my hair and do everything over again because I hate this feeling in my hair so much. I should of just stood with the spray I know best and that's the bumble and bumble thickening spray. it never did this to me smh. I feel disgusted and very disappointed!!",

It's so thick / heavy that it can easily \"deflate\" and / or be hard to create lift at the roots! \n\nI dry my hair w/a Blow Dry Brush (L'ange Le Volume). Style On Steroids is a heat protectant, MOISTURIZING, AND has \"style memory,\" so AFTER my hair is DRY, still working in the same section I just dried - I will spray in my DRY hair - to the roots - but as far (up to 8 inches) away as possible … and THEN BLOW \"DRY\" it in w/my blow dry brush. This method gives my hair extra volume, helps my blow dry volume AND style LAST, and my hair is SUPER soft and silky until I shampoo it again!! \n\nIts ALSO fantastic if you CURL your hair to spray the DRY section BEFORE you curl it … same reasons as blow drying it in! \n\nOf COURSE it's GREAT to use in the traditional texturizing spray methods, too!! After styling and for 2nd, 3rd day, etc hair.",

I spent the majority of my 20s with my hair in a high bun because that was the best i could do to feign some amount of volume. However, fast forward to my 30s - I found a haircut that I love, I bought a hair dryer that works, and most importantly, I found a texture spray that I love. Y'all, this spray has literally changed my life. I've tried plenty of hairsprays, texture sprays, creams, mousses, dry shampoos, YOU NAME IT. From cheap to higher-end, nothing seemed like a perfect fix until my stylist recommended this. I am not historically a splurger when it comes to hair, but this bottle is worth every penny.

Thinking that product might just be medicine, I experimented with some of the most expensive product. FINALLY I found Color Wow! I am so very happy with all products. I am 64 years old with shoulder length, layered, colored, thick, wavy hair. I thought my age was finally taking it's toll on me. Nope! I live in Florida so with coloring, the sun and styling, I just over did it. Color Wow x-strength dreamcoat was the beginning of my healing. I use Kale and Coconut leave-in conditioner. I just bought one minute and \"money\". Styling is based on where I am: office, beach, home. So the product I use is based on that. No matter what, everything is about healthy, beautiful hair. The best part of all of this is that you don't feel like you have heavy gook on your hair. I can run my fingers through my hair and it all feels so natural. I love it when my significant other can play with my hair and I don't have to feel self conscience with product. I've made an investment in Color Wow and it really is paying off in spades. Silly, but I love the packaging when delivered. It almost looks like a gift with the pretty pink tissue paper. :) The last thing is, I go to a top salon. the salon specializes is a product that is upscale and well known. Even my stylist noticed a difference in my hair and asked my what I use. She's going to use Color Wow now also even though the salon features a major competitor. Go figure! Thank you, Color Wow! I'm so thankful I found you. :)",

        "comments": "I bought this spray to use when I put my hair up in a pony tail. I have a lot of hair, so I like to use texture sprays because it doesn't glue my hair down like hairspray, keeps bumps of hair from happening on the top of my head when I'm using a brush to smooth everything out, and controls my fly aways. I read the glowing reviews and the price was better than LivingProof, so I bought this. \n\nI sprayed a light layer - couldn't tell anything was on my hair. Sprayed again and used my brush to make sure everything was in place. This spray made my hair look like I had dandruff! It left behind a thick, while glue-like particles in hair and it was stuck to my brush. What a waste of money.",
