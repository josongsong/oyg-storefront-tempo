I flushed my eyes and applied allergy drops which helped initially but after 3 days of flushing and treating,  it wasn't getting better. I finally went to urgent care. I don't get why after countless similar reviews about this product, nyx doesn't either reformulated or remove this color. Now I will always be worried about every color that I put on my eyes.

I first purchased them in a physical store and yes like many others I was confused how to sharpen the pencil but I did a simple online search and found that although the pencil is plastic it is still able to be sharpened with a normal sharpener. I also saw a tip of getting the tip wet before hand and that made it alot easier but I think after a purchased the NYX sharpener it worked even better I definitely recommend you buy that as well.",
