I use this every night for my double cleanse before acne treatments, and it has changed the game. It eliminates all my daily grime and oil without making my skin too dry and irritated. I would recommend this to people with sensitive skin who have problems with oily/acne prone skin - it has greatly helped me in both of these areas.",

Last night I washed my face with it and did not use any moisturizer. Woke up with a very oily face! I liked everything about it -texture (gel), scent, etc.-it just didn't work for my skin type. I also noticed blackheads on my chin which weren't there when I used the Tatcha cleanser. Going back to Tatcha.",

It leaves my skin smooth and very clean, not dry or tight but the best is that it cleared my skin up. I have occasional hormonal acne and after I started using this it's all but disappeared. I would recommend trying this as a part of an adult acne regimen if you feel like your acne products are doing an ok job but you're still struggling with occasional clogged pores, the lactic acid seems to have really helped the performance of my other acne and retinoid products. I massage it into my face, work into a lather then allow it to stay on for at least 2 minutes while I use my clarisonic and it works great! You don't have to use much and the tube lasts a while, it's a nice cleanser and good value.",

My sister and daughter both use Murad and I thought that I would give it a try and since then, I have not gone back...it is simply the best.  This works well for my skin as it is mature, deep wrinkles in my forehead and drying.  I wet my face, put just a small amount of cleanser on my finger (think the size of toothpaste on your toothbrush) and then spot apply it to my face and work it around BEFORE getting it too wet.  I find that this spreads it out so much better than wetting it in my hands and then putting it on my face - I was losing parts of the product down the sink before it ever got on my face.  Anyway, then I wet what's on my hands, rub into a lather and gently cleanse my face.  It rinses beautifully and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh and NOT dry.  Does it work overnight?  Of course not so if you're expecting miracles, it's not going to happen.  I've been using this about 3 or 4 months now and can see a definite improvement in the texture of my skin.  It seems so much smoother, better tone quality and the pores seem to be not nearly as noticeable.  I am quite satisfied with this product; in fact, I love the entire Resurgence line for my needs.",
