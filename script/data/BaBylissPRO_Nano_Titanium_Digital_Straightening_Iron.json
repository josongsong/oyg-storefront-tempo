Wearing my hair down is making an effort because it'd still be frizzy but this product makes me want to wear it down more! I used Hot Toddy Heat and UV Protectant before blow dry, a straightening product before the flat iron and magic was made. My hair was so shiny, sleek, ZERO frizz! Like I just walked out of the salon! The pics I added were 1) half blow dry, half straight 2) half straight, half curled (w/flat iron) 3) finish with curls.",

Everything was great for a while ... it heat up super fast and goes up to 450 degrees. Until yesterday it just died on me out of the blue ! The digital display reads 94 degrees but the iron is ice cold. I had just used it the day before and to wake up in the morning with a dead flat iron was frustrating to say the least.",
