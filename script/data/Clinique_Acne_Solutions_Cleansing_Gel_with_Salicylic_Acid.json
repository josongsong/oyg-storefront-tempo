Every time one goes away 2 or 3 more pop up. Do not use if you have oily, sensitive skin! I'm going back to my old skincare routine and hopefully I can reverse the damage I've caused using this face wash. Worst mistake ever!",

I bought the travel version of this (with the yellow lotion) as well as the acne solutions trio (which came with a foam cleanser but I prefer this one). Incredible! I had these underground pimples that when reallyyyy squeezed (and sometimes not even then) would come out like a blackhead does but they never went away :/ this set REMOVED THEM almost entirely and now I don't have bumpy highlighter on my face anymore. I oftentimes just use a makeup wipe at night and use the set in the AM and it still leaves me with stellar skin. I don't know why I didn't start using Clinique sooner!!",

I purchased this product hoping it would help clear up some of my blackheads and pimples that we're going around my chin while not being to drying on the skin. Although it certainly helped clear up some of the pimples around my chin it did nothing for my blackheads and actually made my skin extremely dull.  it does lather up nicely yet somehow it never felt like it actually removed all of my make up and my face never really felt clean after as it usually does with other cleansers . If you have very oily skin this might work for you, but this is definitely not good for my combination skin.",
