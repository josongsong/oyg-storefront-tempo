I FINALLY FOUND A POWDER THAT COVERS ALL THE REDNESS ON MY CHEEKS! no joke. it doesn't cause my face to look oily, no blotting sheets necessary. it lasts all day. another thing is I appreciate the small pad that comes with the powder just in case you want to reapply in the middle of the day, but the good news is I can leave my powder at home, because it lasts throughout my day. people compliment me & wonder what I am using. I buy another powder and always go back to this one. it doesn't sink into your pores and make them look huge or settle in the creases of your face, it just looks natural not a cakey powder. & no more redness. I do use the liquid foundation on some days and I love it too! can't go wrong with this powder.",

And even with a super light brush application, the powder sits on the skin, making it look fake and amplifying every. single. pore. I didn't think I had huge pores until I tried this to mattify my nose, only to have it make my pores look like craters covering  the surface of the moon. Yuck! I've used It Cosmetics moisturizers, foundation, concealer, and mascara for years but now I don't feel like I can trust this brand to make products that work or were designed with the customer in mind.",

I'm disappointed this product no longer states that it has the sunscreen, but if you compare the ingredients from the old powder to this new product, you will see it is the same except it doesn't give the percent of the specific ingredients which gave it the classification of saying SPF50.  I still like the way the powder goes on and that the finish on my skin is smooth, dewy and even toned.  You can also control the level of coverage which is nice if you're trying to cover blemishes or the like.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a nice finishing touch without looking like you have painted on your foundation.",
