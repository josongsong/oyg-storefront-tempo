The consistency is very watery so you need quite a few pumps (which makes you use more) but I don't get what the hype is about? It's so watery I can't see it really removing any makeup?  If I didn't purchase it for 50% off I'd definitely be returning.  Didn't do much of anything for me.",

That hasn't changed, but I've noticed on the last 2 bottles that a leak develops around the outside base of the white pump near where it meets the clear bottle.  It builds up until it drips down the side of the bottle.  I keep my bottle under the sink and just reach in and pump it when needed so I didn't immediately notice this leak, not until it made a real mess.  I first thought it was just the last bottle but my current bottle is doing the same thing.  It not only is wasting the oil, but it makes a mess and I've had to sit the bottle in a small dish.  Still, I love this product!",

You have to put the bottle in a dish because it will leak out on your counter; half the product leaked out so half the money you spent on the product is wasted. I reached out regarding this issue and was thrilled they sent me a new bottle, however, the new bottle leaked as well. I was promised a gift card towards a new purchase, but that never came. I've even emailed several times after to follow up - never even receive a response. Extremely shocked and disappointed!? Loved this brand and product.",
