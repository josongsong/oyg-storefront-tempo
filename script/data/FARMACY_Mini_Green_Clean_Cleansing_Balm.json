        "comments": "First, I bought this with my own money. I see a lot of confusing reviews and media tied to these products so I wanted to elaborate that there are four, new Farmacy products. There are two cleansing balms and then there are two face wash cleansers. Each pair has a with fragrance or fragrance free option so that you can choose what is suitable for your skin. With that being said, it is a reformulation of their previous cleansing balm and face wash. And people are angry and upset and leave bad reviews on these products simply because they are mad at Farmacy for reformulating. Bad behavior. \n\nI say that because when looking at these products from Farmacy, you might have to do what i did and just got for it because all the reviews said it sucked and they wanted the old formula back. I, however, hated the old formula from the moment it released and always thought they needed to change it, so i came circling back to this cleansing balm when they rebranded it. \n\nSo if you survived my preface: my honest thoughts are this cleansing balm (i bought the fragrance free version) is so, so, so amazing. It is perfect. I have had zero irritation, or breakouts, it feels good, washes off good, is a perfect first step cleanse and truthfully will be \"the one\" for as long as they keep this formula around. I love the way they did things as far as having a \"normal\" version and \"sensitive skin\" version to choose from…and from years of avoiding this brand, I now stand by them. I look forward to using this every evening and really enjoy it. 10 stars, easy.",

Before I could easily use this then rinse my face then go in with my gentle cleanser now it takes some effort to remove the residue even after my second cleanse",
