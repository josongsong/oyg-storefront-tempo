I decided to try it anyway since it was on sale. It is the first of many, many products I've tried that truly fights frizz for 3 days. Maybe it fights frizz longer, but I have to wash my hair every 3 days. \n\nGive it a shot! You can always return it if you dont like it.",

        "comments": "Some backstory - my hair can be extremely protein sensitive. I had just gone through a roller coaster after a protein-heavy shampoo overloaded my hair, and it took over a month of remedies to balance back out. Until my hair normalized, it was very brittle and broke off constantly, but with my stylist's help we got it under control and finally clarified the problem. She told me my hair needs some protein, but I'll have to be very caredul which products I use going forward. My 45-year-old hair is heavily foil-highlighted, on the thin side, and my ends tend to get dry while my roots can get oily a day or two  after washing. \nFast forward to 2 weeks ago. I was traveling and forgot the smoothing cream/heat protector I normally use, so I stopped at Ulta to get something to get me through the week. Ulta doesn't carry the brand I was using, so I quickly grabbed this balm because the description sounded close to what I was using. I was in a mad hurry and I didn't check the ingredients (glad for that though, I never would've purchased it if i had!). Got it back to the hotel, read the ingredients, and almost immediately returned it because of all the additional proteins it contained alongside the Spirulina…I was sure it would be protein-overload again. Luckily, I was exhausted so I said heck with it and gave it a try. \nI was FLOORED. My hair was shiny, manageable, didnt break off when I flat ironed it, and I had no breakage from it being in a bun the entire next day. When it was time to wash, it didn't leave a ton of buildup behind and after several uses my hair still hasn't gotten overloaded with another protein nightmare. I dont know how or why this stuff works so amazingly for my hair, but it does, and I am so happy I gave it a chance!  My only caution is, if your hair is thin or fine, use a very minimal amount of this product. It is easy to use too much and then it tends to weigh down the hair/make it greasy a bit quicker. As long as I don't use too much, I get beautiful results every time! Will definitely repurchase!",

I said \"why not? Its pretty much the same\" \n\nNOOOO it was not the same! It's even BETTER!!! I have long, thick, frizzy, and wavy hair. No product has worked better than this balm to tame it. I apply my usual leave-ins, then go in with the balm in sections. (4 sections, pea sized amount for section for all my hair) I use the Revlon round brush. They work beautifully together. I feel like the heat from the round brush really activates the product nicely. \nForreal keratin in a bottle omg. NEVER GET RID OF THIS IGK PLSSSSSS",

It can be a bit sticky feeling if you try to apply it to the whole head at once.  It makes my unruly wavy hair so nice and smooth without having to fry it by excessively blow drying to get it as smooth as possible.  This, when used in small ammts,  gives me a quick, smooth and long lasting blow out.  The smell also...omg heavenly...reminds me of a very very beloved and popula fragrance.  I do find that this is better for a smooth straight blowout rather then one with Curled ends.  there is another igk product I prefer for that but I will absolutely repurchase (even though I think this tube will last for a very long time).

I apply it to freshly washed towel-dried hair and either rough dry it or let it air dry to 80-90% then go in with a blow dry brush to finish up and smooth. The result is sleek and long-lasting. Unfortunately each time I've used it I've gotten a dermatitis rash around my hairline that goes away as soon as I wash my hair again and return to my regular products. In those cases this blow dry balm is the only thing that's different. I'm torn because it is effective but if you have sensitive or acne-prone skin you may want to avoid.",

        "comments": "IGK Good Behavior Smoothing Blowout Balm was a complimentary hair product Voxbox gave me to try and review. I really enjoy using this hair product. I felt like this blowout balm saved my hair and is now helping my hair to grow longer, healthier, and faster with a beautiful natural shine. I recommend two things, First please only use a small amount of this product in your hair and use this product for at least a mouth before deciding if this is a product for you or not. I like to squeeze a pea size amount onto the palm of my hand, then massage the product throughout my hands (like you would with a hand moisturizer) and then running my fingers and hands though the bottom of my hair and mid section making sure to spread the product evenly through my hair. Then blow dry and notice this creamy product immediately melting into the hair giving a lasting sleekness, shine and memory of a keratin treatment. It's like I just came from the salon getting salon blowout results but, in my own home. I also noticed less of my hair falling out in the shower from using this product. Remember less is more!!!!! While you will notice a difference in your hair after one use of this product you really want to use this product over a long period of time, if you want to receive the full benefits and results. This isn't that product where if you use the most in one shot you'll see greater result and in a faster time",
