And I love how easily it washes off. As comparison, I used to wear Urban Decay's Perversion mascara a lot, and while I enjoyed that I could build it for a bold & dramatic finished look, it was a beast to take off at night. Ilia's mascara is almost as buildable but so much easier to apply & remove. I bet it'll hold up great when I add a few falsie lash bundles, which I'm about to try for an event this weekend. Solid, high-class mascara at a great price & perfect for everyday wear.",

        "comments": "So I LOVE LOVE the wand. Great curl and lift. Volume. BUT formula is super wet and takes a while to dry so is easy to smudge and slow if you want to build it up.  Also in general smudges more than Bareminerals or Well people which I have had better luck with. More like Beautcounter in consistency but not quite as smudgey through the day but definitely not the staying power of Wellpeople or Bareminerals. I so wanted to like this becuase the wand is THE BEST....",
