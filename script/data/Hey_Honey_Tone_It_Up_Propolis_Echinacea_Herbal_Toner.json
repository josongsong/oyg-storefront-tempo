The only toner that would do such was the tacha AHA toner but it is more expensive. This toner also picks up so muchhhh residue and dirt eithoit clogging pores. Will definitely stick to this one for ever as my toner. If has been calming my acne aswell.",

I've been on a years long rosacea journey, and this was one of the first products I came across that gave me good results back in 2021. Although I was satisfied, I couldn't reason with the price point at that time, and so TIU and I went our separate ways. Fast forward a couple years and several toners, I was ready to come home to my day 1, my holy grail. I was so excited to feel the relief with my first swipe, but I was left feeling stung. Out of curiosity, I checked the ingredients to weed out the culprit, only to be shocked by the listing of Urea!?? All my rosacea girlies know that's an ingredient to avoid, and so now I'm left to starting over and settling my skin…and finding another toner that won't betray me this way!",

It does have an herbal scent that is very uplifting and almost energizing! It never burns after a good exfoliation or microdermabrasion which is super important to me! Calms my redness, minimizes my pores and helps heal blemishes which I actually don't get anymore since using all hey honey skincare! I follow with be clear drops and good morning serum then either boost it up, relax or 24/7 moisturizer!",

A couple weeks later I was getting painful cystic acne on and under my jaw again. \n\nI had a sample of this stuff and thought it might be calming so I used it on a cotton pad. I clean my face well and it still got a lot of extra residue off my face. I woke up and the redness was greatly reduced and most of the pain was gone. I used it a couple more days, just this and aloe and at night my prescription retinol. \n\nI honestly have never seen the amount of healing and quick turnaround from a breakout with anything else. I was disappointed to see it was so expensive but this is just worth it for me and I ordered it right away. I guess in this case you really do get what you pay for. If I didn't have acne or any face inflammation to deal with it might not be something I'd buy but I do and this stuff works. In addition to my acne being almost gone the skin above and below my eyes feels stronger and less crapey/sensitive. Highly recommended.",

I've been on a years long rosacea journey, and this was one of the first products I came across that gave me good results back in 2021. Although I was satisfied, I couldn't reason with the price point at that time, and so TIU and I went our separate ways. Fast forward a couple years and several toners, I was ready to come home to my day 1, my holy grail. I was so excited to feel the relief with my first swipe, but I was left feeling stung. Out of curiosity, I checked the ingredients to weed out the culprit, only to be shocked by the listing of Urea!?? All my rosacea girlies know that's an ingredient to avoid, and so now I'm left to starting over and settling my skin…and finding another toner that won't betray me this way!",
