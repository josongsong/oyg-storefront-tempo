I didn't notice a difference except the patch under my left eye tingled and burned a bit. I don't have any breakouts in that area so maybe this product just isn't right for my sensitive skin. I received this as a free sample so I'm happy I at least got to try it at no cost.",

The masks do not have enough serum to even last 1 minute before they dry on your face.  I don't see how these 5 eye masks are worth this price point. Each package i've opened is a struggle because the eye masks are not aligned with the protecting sheets they are suppose to be secured in. Also, most the serum sticks to these sheets and not the actual mask.",

To be fair, he saw me wearing them but he's also brutally honest if he doesn't see a difference. These do indeed, make your under eye area almost shimmer and the skin tightens up nicely during your session.\n\nOthers have mentioned packaging - ok, it's not perfect. Before putting the masks on rub them around in the serum that collected in the trays and even if the bag if needed. You can also put the serum directly on your skin and cover it with the masks. The mask is there to hold the serum in, that's it. I haven't experienced any mis-shaped masks. \n\nI love these am and about to make my second purchase of them.",

Most importantly though, these eye patches stay in place and de-puff eyes.  They stay in place… this is huge because I feel like half the battle of eye patches is trying to keep the slimy suckers in place!  Even my husband was able to wear them (and not complain about them!) Cool to touch and didn't irritate skin.  I would recommend and buy again.",

        "comments": "I love how cute these are and the benefits they claim to give your under eyes. The ingredients list is amazing too. BUT, my biggest issue is the packaging! The masks do not have enough serum to even last 1 minute before they dry on your face.  I don't see how these 5 eye masks are worth this price point. Each package i've opened is a struggle because the eye masks are not aligned with the protecting sheets they are suppose to be secured in. Also, most the serum sticks to these sheets and not the actual mask.",
