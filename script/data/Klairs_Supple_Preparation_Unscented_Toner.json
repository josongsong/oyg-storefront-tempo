Wanted to love it but am struggling to understand its purpose. After morning and night use for close to three months, I don't think it achieved anything for my skin.",

It feels cushiony going onc provides a nice moisture boost to one's regimen, is excellent for mature, dry skin and drier climates.  Those with oily skin wikl appreciate that it's not greasy and soaks right in.  To get the maximum effect of the cushiony feeling, I prefer to apply a nickel or quarter size amount directly with my hands to my face, no cotton pad.",

        "comments": "I'm almost ashamed to admit that I've been stockpiling this. Also, I have it in various sizes - 180ml bottles, 30ml bottles, 3ml bottles. Basically I am able to bring with me wherever I go so that I never have to be without it. I even use it on my body because I've got really dry skin sometimes. I'm so uncomfortable with not using this that I feel as though I'm going to get a breakout if I use a different toner? Must be some warped psychological effect. I've used various toners before and none of them made me feel like something is happening. Most toner simply feel like overpriced water to me. Some are overly perfumed chemical smelling water, which I absolutely hate. Then I had the chance to try out this from one of the samples I received. This smells so organic and fragrance free. The texture is slightly more tacky than water but still viscous enough to be absorbed easily. I fell in love. As this toner feels so good, I don't even care about the cleansers I use anymore because I figured that any drugstore cleanser works since I'm going to be slapping this on immediately and it would adjust the pH level of my skin to a healthy range. This toner is mild, non-irritating, does not break me out. It is so mild that when it gets into my eye area, it doesn't not sting my tear ducts. In fact, I think a little entered my eyes just now when I used it, but I didn't feel anything. Either this has a numbing agent or it is simply very mild. So given how mild it is, this doesn't do anything to cure acne, FYI so don't be counting on that. This also doesn't minimise your pores. What this does really well is make your skin feel relieved and well moisturised after a thorough cleansing. I kind of noticed that the fine lines on my forehead seem to have reduced ever since I started using this toner. My forehead tends to be extremely dry and wrinkly. Now, it is more plumped and makeup no longer goes on patchy. I'm able to pull a better heist in conning people into thinking that I have stunning complexion. Regarding my method of application, I like to pour it into my palm and pat it in for half a minute. I don't see the value in using a cotton pad because I'm pretty good at cleansing my face and generally will not have leftover dirt or soap on my face after cleaning. So I feel that a cotton pad may be a waste of perfectly good toner. It's absorbing toner away from my skin. If there's one item you want to try from Klairs, it has to be this. I never cared for toners until I started using this.",

Didn't feel sticky and all my other skincare items absorbed nicely into it. \n\nUnfortunately, it left my face in breakouts and bumps within a few days. I took it out of my routine and tried again a couple months later, and it did the same thing. It's been a couple weeks since I stopped using it again and my face is clearing up.\n\nI didn't use any other new products or during my trials, so I know it was this toner.",
