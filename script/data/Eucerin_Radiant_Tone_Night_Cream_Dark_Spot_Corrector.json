The texture is lightweight, absorbs well into the skin, and doesn't feel greasy or heavy overnight. I've noticed a visible improvement in my skin tone, with some of my dark spots appearing lighter and my complexion looking more even.\n\nOne of the things I appreciate most is that it doesn't cause irritation, which is a huge plus for my skin. It's also fragrance-free, making it great for sensitive skin types. However, I do think it requires consistent, long-term use to see the full effect on stubborn dark spots. It's not an overnight miracle, but with patience, it delivers results.\n\nThe only slight downside is that it may not be hydrating enough for drier skin types, so I pair it with a good moisturizer. Otherwise, it's a solid product that I'd recommend to anyone looking for a gentle yet effective dark spot corrector!",

It smells so much like perfume which I was not expecting from Eucerin. A lot of their products seem theyare geared towards sensitive skin. I don't mind fragrance in skincare I wouldn't say I love it but it isn't a deal breaker for me if the product works good but this smells like straight up perfume and it's strong and lasts on my face. I even washed my hands like 4 times before I couldn't smell it anymore after applying. I don't want my face to smell like perfume I like more clean spa like scents. It's disappointing. Face products shouldn't have scents in them anyway like I really don't understand why people want their face to smell like bottles of perfume like more expensive  department store brands it's horrible.",
