I love using this on makeup days as a first step to double cleanse or on other days when I just feel oily or want to deep clean my pores. The oil really gets in there and dissolves all the little gunky stuff and gentlt exfoliates. Its so satisfying to use. Make sure to emulsify with water and rub in a bit more before removing. It leaves my skin feeling soooo soft,  clean, nourished, and not stripped at all.",
