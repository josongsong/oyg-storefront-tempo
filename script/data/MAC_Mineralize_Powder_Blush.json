I am so tired of purchasing products based on great reviews only to find out the product is junk. I know quality when I see it. This blush is worth every penny. Even at full price. It blends AMAZINGLY well and the texture is like velvet. I purchased this in \"petal power\". It has just the right amount of shimmer and the quality beats everything else out there that I've purchased. HOWEVER....do NOT trust Ulta's photoshopped images. The colors are NOT accurate. Stick to the description and you won't have any surprises. \nP.S. Ulta you seriously need to work on that. Some products don't even show the color palette, just the packaging. And others the color is not even in the same rainbow.",

I love this blush and don't understand why they would change the color but call it by the same name.",
