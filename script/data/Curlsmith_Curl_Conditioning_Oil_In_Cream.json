Issues with dryness, not getting curl definition, easily tangled, etc. Going through so many products and techniques over the years, this is the only time I've actually been blown away with the results. I've been growing my hair out after being bald for years, with it now being maybe 8-10 inches of pure beautiful fro. I ended up grabbing this product along with their moisture shampoo+conditioner, and not only were the effects there from the get-go, but LASTED. Every day for a week I'd get up, throw the bonnet off and be shocked with how soft and moisturized my hair was. My curls were more defined than with any product I've used in the past (still a fro, but the curls were there!) and the hair stayed detangled. Plus it smells amazing!! while I can see why price point might be an issue for some, I think it's worth every penny.",

After seeing the amazing results people were posting online, I wanted to try this (have been using DevaCurl for over a decade). \n- You have to use a LOT of product. Way more than previous DC products I have used. Even then...\n- By the end of wash day, it already looks like I'm not wearing any product on my hair at all. By the end of the day, my hair loses definition and starts to frizz. Day 2 hair looks dull and undefined. Day 3 hair looks like I've been crawling in a cave for 5 years. \n- The bottle is super cheap - like a 25-cent water bottle thickness. You have to really squeeze to get the product out, and I think I'm one squeeze away from cracking it. \n\nBottom line - if this was a drugstore product labeled \"curly\" I'd give it 3 stars. But this is not drugstore priced. Can't wait to get to the bottom of it and return my hair to the DevaCurl products that I know and trust.",
