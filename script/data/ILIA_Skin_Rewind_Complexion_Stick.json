I wear 16N and I'm so impressed with the color match! usually foundations pull too yellow or oxidize to orange. I started to think I was olive toned and actually started with that but it was genuinely too green for me. the neutral was perfect. after prepping my skin with moisturizer and letting it absorb, I swipe this beginning around my nose towards my ears, just a couple of light swipes on each cheek and then blend. I set with a pressed powder around my tzone and I'm basically all done. if I have extra spots I want to cover, I dab it on and set with powder. it plays well with my preferred powder blushes and couldn't be easier to travel with or quicker to apply. I haven't had issues with it clinging to dry patches but I also stay consistent with my skincare and it's been humid. I expect I'll need less setting powder in the winter.",

I can touch my skin and it'll remove all the product. so frustrating! don't recommend for anyone who doesn't have dry to super dry skin. I bought this after I tried the skin tint and I guess this brand just doesn't work for my skin.",

I was having such a hard time finding a foundation that worked for me, I tried Ilia's Super Serum Skin Tint first and hated it, but this product is perfection. It's so easy to apply, and blends out seamlessly with a brush. It feels like nothing on the skin, it's incredibly lightweight. The coverage is light to medium, it's very buildable without getting cakey. It's not matte, it's not dewy, it just looks like skin. It has the most beautiful finish. I set this with a tiny bit of powder and it lasts all day without getting weird or settling into my lines. I highly recommend this!",

Im 72 and a lot of cream foundations/liquid no longer work for me. No wrinkles at 72 but i love how this foundation blends easy and does not sit on the skin like a mask. Buildable coverage if so desired. Not greasy, shiny or sticky. Doesnt transfer onto things. Great color selection too.",

It is pricy but worth it in my opinion especially for how little i use. It did grab onto a dry breakout i had but a bit of\nConcealer over it helped alot! If you have dry patches you may need to moisturize first and exfoliate. I love how this wears as well almosy getting better with time.

It's light coverage and evened out my skin tone and the redness I have. It claims to work as a concealer as well but as someone with acne scars it's not going to be 100% full coverage so you would have to go in with concealer. The foundation stick didn't make me feel dry or oily and this gives me a natural look. It is pricy but I would totally buy this over and over again",

        "comments": "Love the thumb indent on this packaging. Helps me from not dropping it during application. I need this on ALL your products ! I have dropped my mascara tube and wand and also the liquid eye shadow. I'm a bit clumsy. Lol. If there was an indent, I probably wouldn't have. Heck put thumb holds on both ends of the mascara tube for easy. I gave this 4 stars because it could use improvement. I have mature skin. It does get flaky with application so I did need to use an applicator to blend in lightly to prevent this and use a soft touch. Do not overwork the product. Using my fingers to blend made more \"flakes\". Secondly, the coverage isn't as much as I would have liked. I need 2 to 3 passes in trouble areas like around my nose for example. It's not as buildable as the true skin concealer. (Which is amazing) Lastly, the color in the tube is much lighter on the skin. I ordered a color based upon the color match tool online. I also got a custom match through customer service sending an email in a selfie. The CS representative recommended lighter than my online results. I had already ordered the darker shade the website recommended. It was too light. Both would have been. The product goes on lighter than it appears. It does blend well though. So I would err on going a little bit darker or reaching out to CS for a match. I may order 2 colors next time. Recommendations for Ilia would be to add more pictures to the color chosing process. More skin types, more images. I would also add more colors to the product line. There is a light medium in neutral that seems to be missing. I know my exact color for your true skin concealer but that is not a color match option for deciding on this particular product. I think that's a mistake because they work well together. I used the concealer under this to give me more coverage and they worked flawlessly in tandem. Overall this is a good product. It doesn't lay in my fine lines and did feel good on my skin. I wore it all day. It did not rub off onto clothing. Bonus, it was compatible as a base with my SPF applied on top. I will most likely buy again.",

        "comments": "Generally I love Ilia's products but this one wasn't for me. I tried it several different ways daily for 1.5 weeks. I tried it on my bare face, I tried it after prepping my skin really well, I tried it with primer underneath, I tried it with sunscreen underneath, I tried it as a spot concealer, and as a foundation. Despite how I applied it directly to skin, with a sponge, with a brush, it never quite performed (in a long term sense) the way I wanted. Shade: I received the shade 12N Sycamore; it's not quite my right shade, but I can make it work. Experience: It feels a bit chalky. It doesn't absorb into the skin so much as it stays on top. It doesn't look bad though after the initial application. The formulation gives you a realistically matte finish. I didn't find that there was any separation or reaction with my skincare products. Typically I prefer my foundation to be sheer coverage so my freckles are still visible. This was able to provide the sheer coverage I am looking for. The challenges I experience were that I found the product tended to settle into my lines (for context I am 28 years old). Areas where I have dimples or smile crinkles tended to become more pronounced because they product would sink into those place. Ultimately this is what led me to not enjoy the experience so much. On the plus side, I do think the initial application is lovely. The product on the skin looks amazing at golden hour. It's really only the settling that I didn't enjoy (which with proactive consistent care, the settling can be resolved). Packaging: Packaging is nice. It has a soft matte feel. The tube has an indentation that is comfortable to hold. It is a stick foundation so you will have to swipe it on (either to the back of your hand or directly onto your face). I think if the product works well for you, it would be a great size to bring when traveling. Ultimately I won't be repurchasing, but I will continue to use it as a spot concealer. Please note: I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.",
