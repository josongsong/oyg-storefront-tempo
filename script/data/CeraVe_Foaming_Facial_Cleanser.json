I can't be sure, but I feel that this product is what is causing me to break out all over (and my skin is not acne-prone). I have tried CeraVe's other hydrating cleansers, and I think the foaming quality of those products cleanses better. I'll skip this one next time in favor of their other cleaners.",

It wasnt until my daughter started using this cleanser and began getting dermatitis as well that I finally figured out it was this cleanser causing all our problems. After stopping it, we are both seeing major improvement. Beware, this stuff is harsh and not for everyone!!",

Since using this face wash daily, my skin feels less oily, and it doesn't strip away moisture at all. It's gentle yet effective, and I've noticed fewer breakouts, which is a big win for my acne-prone, sensitive skin.\n\nThe only downside for me is the smell. Even though it says \"no added fragrance,\" it kind of smells like buttered popcorn to me—not bad, just unexpected. I'm someone who prefers completely fragrance-free products, but I've gotten used to it and it doesn't bother me as much anymore.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this for anyone with oily and sensitive skin. It's a great everyday cleanser!",

I love that it has hyaluronic acid. I have dry skin and dry patches. I use this cleanser and the CeraVe moisturizer in the tub. I use it in the morning for extra hydration, then I switch to another cleanser at night. The people who are giving this a low rating don't understand what it is for. THIS IS NOT A MAKEUP REMOVER. There are no claims that it will remove makeup. If you wear makeup, you should be taking your makeup off with some type of makeup removal product FIRST. Then go in with this cleanser.",

However this face wash completely burned my skin and left me with red incredibly itchy and painful skin on my face after one full day of use (2 washes). I would not recommend this product to anyone with any type of sensitivity. I figured the \"fragrance free, paraben-free, gentle on skin and non drying\" description would work for me but apparently I was wrong. Disappointed is an understand.",
