It leaves a nice glow in the morning when you first apply it, but then throughout the day I notice my skin getting oily. I feel like I have to blot my face or reapply powder. It's a very nice moisturizer, but not for mattifying skin.",

I have combination skin that leans towards oily so i prefer a matte finish, and the product is very matte, it just does not seem to aborb into my skin well. I will be returning the second bottle i purchased before i realized this product was the culprit",

I let it absorb into the skin and then followed up with my make up. It made my make up last all day without the crazy shine that happens around my nose, forehead, and cheek area. Most oil control motorist oysters, make your face feel very dry, but not this one this actually hydrated my skin, but yet controlled the oil on my troubled areas. It allows my tinted moisturizer and other Dewey makeup to look Dewey and not oily  I am such a fan of this product. I will be purchasing over and over.  For reference, I am 45 with oily combination skin. My routine is cleanser, toner, serums, moisturizer   Troublr areas:  fine lines and pores around the nose.",
