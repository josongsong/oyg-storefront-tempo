The smell is extrnely strong and herbal. Not horrible on its own, but add that it burned my face and left it greasy and red for awhile, i cant be continuing to use it. Like the high spf, but i think the lesson for me, personally, is that mineral sunscreen is the way to go since rhe chemical sunscreens seem to make my seemingly mild rosacea that i had under control, just completly inflamed again.",

I never review products but this has blown me away I had to review. It's a hefty pricetag, but for someone who needs sunscreen and who sweats like I do this was an absolute game changer.",

(true story).\nDon't be skeptical ladies, it's NOT genetics... it's DERMALOGICA! This product is so versitile. It certainly does it's job in the 'age' department--what a perfect, line free glow after years of damage--but please do not limit Age Smart to aging skin. I have acne-prone combination skin; sun damaged, and underhydrated. Everyone always insisted I use oil-free/oil control lotion--but to my surprise, I stumbled upon Age Smart Dynamic Recovery after a very bad sunburn. I now use Age Smart year-round. Age Smart dynamic recovery brings my skin back to life! Non-pore clogging, no breakouts, works wonders under my mineral foundation while allowing me SPF on my face--SPF on MY face? Unheard of! Dermalogica stumped me with this one! Age Smart goes against everything I would expect from a product which is not formulated for acne prone skin. Use after Age Smart Skin Resurfacing cleanser and you will be AMAZED at your even-toned, smooth, hydrated, photo-ready, confidence-building complexion. \"You're never too young to be Age Smart.\" So don't be afraid to pull out those free samples from your last Dermalogica purchase--I'm so glad I did.",

The actual product if very light, has a nice smell and would be awesome if I didn't have the skin irritation.",
