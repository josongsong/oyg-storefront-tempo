What a difference it made in my skin. It was so plush and plump after using this . I have very textured, sensitive, acne-prone skin and this works AMAZING as a primer. My makeup laid so flawlessly and that's very hard to do with texture So this product is a win for me.  I highly recommend this for my textured skin girlies, specifically the fragrance-free one!",

        "comments": "If you're looking for a cleansing balm that feels indulgent, smells like a spa in a jar, and melts away makeup while delivering hydration, the Pro-Collagen Black Cherry Cleansing Balm is a standout. It's particularly well-suited for dryer or mature skin types, and anyone who enjoys fragrance-rich skincare experiences. However, if you're sensitive to scent, have oily or acne-prone skin, or prefer a cleanser that rinses completely residue‑free, you may want to patch-test first or explore fragrance‑free or lighter alternatives.

I receive the Elemis Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm as a sample,so I wasn't really familiar with this product. I used it as directed and I was immediately impressed with the results,my skin was left so soft,and dewy looking! This is such an amazing cleasing balm,but it can be used as an overnight mask as well,which I tried it out as,and I loved it!! I will now be using this as part of my daily skincare regimen! I highly suggest you try this cleansing balm/overnight mask!",

I reached out to customer support to see if they had any recommendations and they told me that this is not intended to remove eye makeup and then proceeded to recommend TWO other products I should be using on top of this if I actually want to remove my makeup. Lots of false advertising and then they were zero help beyond attempting to get me to spend even more of my money on their products. RUN far away from this product and this company.",
