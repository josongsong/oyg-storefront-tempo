Although it it stings the eyes, i was willing to put up with it and try really hard not to get it in my eye when using for the face. I thought i liked it so i bought two more. It turns out that this micellar water is the reason for my irritated and itchy skin and i didn't realize it until i started using it on my body to remove sunscreen. I get bumpy and itchy skin after using it. Then the next day i have pustular looking acne on my back and arms. For reference, I have KP, sensitive and reactive skin that is combination and has acne. I have a consistent routine that includes daily sunscreen wearing and occasional light makeup. If you purchase this, pay attention to the next week or two and see how your skin reacts. Hopefully you can return it immediately.",

        "comments": "I truly am such a fan of this entire brand so I hate to write a negative review about them, but this product was very disappointing. I wear a lot of makeup some days, especially around the eyes so I need a (and have found some) makeup remover that is safe in and around the eye area. This is NOT that. Even a small press against closed eyes made my eyes burn for at least 30 seconds. It did, however, take every last trace of my makeup off which was convenient. Since I always wear eye makeup on days I wear makeup, I will be returning this product. Perhaps their makeup removing balm will be gentler on the eyes.",

I use the micellar water on a makeup eraser and it removes 1000% of my liquid eyeliner and mascara. The wipes I had been using would leave residue and never remove all my mascara. This micellar water is gentle on the eyes and doesn't burn at all. I do follow up with a face wash but I certainly don't feel like HAAAVE to. It's a clean easy way to remove makeup if you're a little lazy like me. I've never used anything from Cerave before this and now I'm curious to try more from the line.",

I have been using an eye makeup remover and a cleansing oil (plus warm water rinse) to remove makeup before cleansing with Foaming Cleanser and an electronic face brush.  With the Micellar Water, I can skip the eye makeup remover, cleansing oil, and messy warm water rinse steps!  Saves me time, mess, and money.  Also great for traveling with the flip-top cap.  Love it",

It works great for makeup removal, but after a few days of use the skin around my eyes is swollen, red, dry, and painful. It looks like chemical burns around my eyes and after googling I found that this has happened to other people as well. The symptoms do not occur immediately after use so it took time to figure out what was doing this by stopping all products and slowly adding back in after a long healing process.   Definitely not the gentle skincare I expect from CerAVe.",
