The first time I used it I thought I used too much, so I tried again using half that amount. While it was a little better, I still found my hair feeling crunchy the next day. I appreciate that this is unscented, and in theory it is a great product but it was not the mousse for me. I know there are a lot of positive reviews for this product, so it may just have not been the right fit for my hair, but I would not purchase this.",
