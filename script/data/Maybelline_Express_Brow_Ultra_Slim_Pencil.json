The pencil is easy to use and the brush softens the look for a more natural finish. The color is balanced, not too dark or too light, and it blends in to blur seamlessly with the natural brow. It does not last the whole day, but it stays in place for a couple of hours.",

My one complaint is that for the first half hour of wear, I find smudges right below my eyebrows.  But I love the result too much to care!  I've been a Lash Sensational addict for years, but this gets my lower lashes looking amazing.  I have a new HG!",

It's not going to stop me from trying another waterproof one, but any suggestions? Ive used Maybelline products since I was a teenager, just need to find the right waterproof mascara for me!",
