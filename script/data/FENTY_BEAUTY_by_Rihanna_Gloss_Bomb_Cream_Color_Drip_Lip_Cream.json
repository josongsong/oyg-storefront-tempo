        "comments": "Honey Waffle and Cookie Jar. \nI feel somewhat conflicted about this product. Rhianna is a cool tone girl so it works out perfectly for me cause I'm a dark hair, bright winter flow- cool olive. Yellow-green undertone. References for foundation Smashbox LN20 and Halo Light Olive. ABH 220N foundation. Tarte 22N concealer. I wear 120 and 130 concealer in Fenty. The gloss colors are so unique and wonderful for complimenting my skin. I don't look good in warm lipsticks. Do you know how hard it is to find a Orange Brown lip gloss or a Honey Butter Cream Yellow without clashing on my hyperpigmentation or washing me out?! Very difficult.  I finally found a more muted cool toned and soft color of a color I've been searching for. It looks good because of the unique color, it feels hydrating...I have not tried it on dehydrated lips. That's the true test. I always thought Tartes Maracuja balms and plumps are deeply hydrating. I have a small collection of glosses so that's why I bought them. I can't wear these with lip liners destroys the liners themselves. I have matte and really good ones that stay on but the Fenty gloss doesn't allow them to stay on. Toofaced and ABH lip glosses work well with all my lip liners. I cannot  recommend it unless you solely will just wear the gloss by itself. I would not buy it again if I could wear it with a liner.  I wanted a gloss I could wear in all circumstances.",

Rhianna is a cool tone girl so it works out perfectly for me cause I'm a dark hair, bright winter flow- cool olive. Yellow-green undertone. References for foundation Smashbox LN20 and Halo Light Olive. ABH 220N foundation. Tarte 22N concealer. I wear 120 and 130 concealer in Fenty. The gloss colors are so unique and wonderful for complimenting my skin. I don't look good in warm lipsticks. Do you know how hard it is to find a Orange Brown lip gloss or a Honey Butter Cream Yellow without clashing on my hyperpigmentation or washing me out?! Very difficult.  I finally found a more muted cool toned and soft color of a color I've been searching for. It looks good because of the unique color, it feels hydrating...I have not tried it on dehydrated lips. That's the true test. I always thought Tartes Maracuja balms and plumps are deeply hydrating. I have a small collection of glosses so that's why I bought them. I can't wear these with lip liners destroys the liners themselves. I have matte and really good ones that stay on but the Fenty gloss doesn't allow them to stay on. Toofaced and ABH lip glosses work well with all my lip liners. I cannot  recommend it unless you solely will just wear the gloss by itself. I would not buy it again if I could wear it with a liner.  I wanted a gloss I could wear in all circumstances.",

It leaks to a point where when you open it, it ends up all over the place and wates soooo much product. I havent even ised it much and the bottle is already half gone. The applicator is big and nice. The consistency of it can get runny sometimes whoch then also causes mess. I guess if its warmer it gets runny. My lips eat this stuff, i usually have to reapply within the hour or so. Other than that its ok. Would i buy it again? Absolutely not.",
