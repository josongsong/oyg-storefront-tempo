        "comments": "The texture is silky and lightweight, yet it delivers amazing medium-to-full coverage without feeling heavy. My skin looks smooth, even, and radiant all day, no cakiness, no settling into fine lines.\n\nThe serum infusion makes such a difference it feels like I'm giving my skin a treatment while wearing makeup. It's hydrating but not greasy, and it wears beautifully for hours. I also love that the shade N40 matches my skin tone perfectly with no weird oxidation or patchiness.\n\nIf you're looking for a foundation that blends effortlessly, lasts all day, and leaves your skin looking like your best skin ever, this is it. Worth every penny!",

        "comments": "I'm excited to share my experience with this foundation, especially for people with extremely dry skin. As someone in the same boat, I've always struggled with foundations creating dry patches, but this one has turned out to be a game-changer. Mind you, I'm very picky with my foundation but the way it seamlessly melds with my skin without emphasizing dryness is truly impressive. \n\nMy go to foundation is the Estee Lauder Future HydraLyst but trying this foundation will be my new favorite since it offers both better coverage (I have dark circles and hyperpigmentation) without being too shiny. I noticed sometimes that the Estée Lauder foundation wouldnt cover some of my hyper pigmentation so I would have to put on another layer or add concealer, which makes it slightly cakey (it also didn't oxidized). This one strikes the perfect balance. \n\nLiving in the humid climate of Florida, I was initially skeptical about its staying power, but to my delight, it held up exceptionally well. Unlike other foundations that would slide off in the heat, this one remained  throughout the day. This will be apart of my everyday make up and even going out days!\n\nFor anyone with dry skin, I highly recommend giving this foundation a try. The hydration it provides, combined with its longevity, makes it an excellent choice. However, if you have oily skin, you might want to approach with caution as it could leave a slightly dewy finish that might not suit your preferences. Personally, I encountered no issues blending other makeup products on top and simply used a make up brush. I also had no breakout although I'm very acne prone. A suggestion is that I  wish it was water proof or had spf.\n\nIn conclusion, this foundation's ability to combat dryness, provide great coverage, and withstand hot and humid conditions makes it a winner for those of us with dry skin. It's a product I would highly recommend to anyone!!",

        "comments": "I was very excited to receive and try this foundation from MAC and BzzAgent because the claim of it being like skin care, hydrating, and Moisturizing. As a person with dry skin at the moment, this was to drying and Matte for my tastes. When it's first applied, it's beautiful, radiant, and has a nice glow. As it wears throughout the day it becomes drying and clings to dry patches and in creases. After 1p hours of wear it was extremely cakey looking and has settled in my fine lines and creases. As a makeup artist I think this would work best for normal/Oily skin types and not dry/mature types that need hydration and like a radiant/glowy finish. \nI prepped my skin as usual for dry skin and didn't use setting powder only setting spray.",
