I love their body washes and kept this in mind when i bought it, I was expecting this cleanser to be just as good but boy was i wrong. i dont use any waterproof makeup products and a majority of the time i dont wear makeup but i still double cleanse regradless of whether or not i wore makeup that day. This barely took off makeup, so much would be left behind that id either have to triple wash my face or just use micellar water to get the rest off. My face never felt clean afterwards either and honesly, it felt like i had even more gunk and oils on my face than what i started with. i really wanted to like this and i continued to use it after deciding that i didnt like the product. im not sure if your skin is suppose to feel hydrated after using this or what and if thats the case, this might work if your skin is on the drier side but thats a big if.",
