But that wasnt needed, I absolutely love this stuff! I was in desperate need of a toner to add to my routine to hold in hydration to my skin and its done exactly that. Im less oily, my overall face has brightened since adding into my routine and my pores are so small now! I love using this right before putting on my cosrx snail mucin essence I really think they work so well together to hydrate and brighten my face, this is definitely worth getting!",
