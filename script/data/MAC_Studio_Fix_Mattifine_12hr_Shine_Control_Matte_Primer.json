It leaves a matt finish without looking dull & has a blurring effect that I love. A tiny amount is truly all you need to control oils and have a flawless matt finish to layer your foundations or powders over. I've even worn it by itself, it's that good at controlling shine. I have oily combo skin that tends to lean more oily certain times of the month and all the time during the summer. This is now my holy grail for keeping my complexion from looking like an oil slick. Even holds up in the Louisiana heat & humidity. So my fellow oily friend, trust your big sis and give this magic primer a try♥️",

        "comments": "I got this to replace my old (holy grail) Rimmel matte primer that is no longer sold anywhere. This had good reviews and a similar consistency, so I was sold. However, immediately after using this product my foundation was super cakey. I have combination skin and I only applied this in my oily areas. I hoped it would get better within a few hours after it settled into my skin. However, I noticed throughout the day that my foundation looked dry and flaked off in some spots and then rubbed off in others. My makeup normally lasts 12+ hours. I returned immediately after my first use and I will be trying the fenty beauty matte primer next.",
