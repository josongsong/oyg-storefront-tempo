The only con I have is that this does not smell like roses but tomatoes to me. It kind of reminds me of Crabtree and Evelyns Garden scent-- that greenery garden and tomato smell. I have made Rosewater before from roses I grow in my yard, and this Rosewater smells NOTHING like that. That's why I knocked off 1 star. Otherwise, it's a great hydrating spray. Definitely recommend 💯",

I was so happy to have found this and tried it. It only has the 1 ingredient and does not irritate my face whatsoever. I was nervous at first as there are some reviews claiming it has a vinegar smell. I have not found that to be true. I think it smells just as you would expect from a rosewater toner, it smells like roses. I will definitely be buying again and recommend to anyone looking for a simple rosewater toner without all those extra ingredients that works as it should and doesn't irritate the face, neck, or chest.
