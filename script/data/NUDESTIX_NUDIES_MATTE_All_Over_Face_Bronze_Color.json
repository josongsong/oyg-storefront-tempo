It leans more orange than red which i though might not work for my skin tone (light, neutral) but you can blend it out or build it up depending on how much color you want. Feels great on my skin, too. Im glad i took a chance on this one!!!",

Can also swipe on the lips/ lids for a matchy-matchy look. As someone who has dry skin/ prefers a more neutral toned blush, Yes i would recommend. Did not mess up the concealer i had layered underneath it to cover acne.",

On one hand, the color (Bondi Belle) is absolutely beautiful- Its the perfect tone between contour and bronzer, and the product goes on and blends lovely. HOWEVER, the moment this arrived, it smelled like sour crayons. I had a wierd feeling about it but couldnt find anything online about the smell and figured maybe its just one of those products that doesnt smell pleasant (not everything has to smell like chocolate). In using it, it was nice enough to get through the foul smell, which did not linger once blended in. Upon use, i found my face breaking out in only the areas i used the bronzer. Thinking this could be a fluke, i stopped using it. I recently started using it again and started breaking out again. Im not sure if its the product, or if i recieved one that was expired in the first place. Either way, what a waste to have to throw it out, especially since this color is beautiful and unique.",

          "caption": "Thanks to @nudestix and @bzzagent for giving me the opportunity to try Nudies Matte Cream All Over Bronzer Stick in Bondi Belle. \n\nI'm usually not a fan of cream bronzing products. I find they end up feeling too heavy or greasy on my skin. They also usually emphasize my pores and finelines. But this product has changed the way I see cream products. I love that it feels super light on the skin and has a matte finish. The dual end cream/brush stick make application effortless and easy. I was actually surprised that it didn't have any silicone/dimethicone because it glides on smoothly and blended seamlessly. It also has really good color pay off and staying power even in hot weather. I only wish I got this in a color which I can also use for my lips. I love that this is a multitasking stick that can also be used on eyes and lips. This will come in super handy when I travel. I can't wait to try them in other colors!\n\n#nudestix #bzzagent #gifted #bronzer #creambronzer #allinone #multitasking #beautyproducts #beautybloggers #beautybloggersca #beautyreview\n#bronzerreview #3in1 #travelfriendly",

I have never tried Nudestix products before and I was really missing out. I really liked how it gave my skin a natural looking flush. It is also a multi-tasking superhero because you can use it on your whole face(lips, eyes, cheeks). It also comes in a reusable makeup tin with a mirror so you can bring it with you on the go! #bzzagent #gotitfree",

It goes on very easily. I more tap in in several spots rather than draw a line. It blends beautifully and it lasts all day long. The brush end is great for blending, but fingers work too. It adds natural looking color to my face. I really like the look of this! There is also a good amount of product in the tube, which was nice to see.",

I really like this blush stick a lot, the color is really beautiful and extremely buildable which I really enjoy for on the go or dramatic looks. The shade Bubba reminds me of a Too Faced blush that was discontinued a while ago, and it's a great alternative, especially with the ease of use without necessarily needing brushes. I find the product is a little on the dry side compared to other cream/face stick products I've used, and its a bit difficult to blend naturally. I also find that it works best as a blush as opposed to lip color, as it seems to sit on the top of the lips and looks a bit like paint. It's a nice product, but I found myself reaching for other favorites more. I do plan on continuing to use it though, because it really is such a lovely bright pink and is perfect for a pretty vibrant flushed look!",
