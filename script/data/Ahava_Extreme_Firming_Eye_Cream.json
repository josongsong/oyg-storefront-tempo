They either make my eyes water, cause redness and irritation on the skin around my eyes or leave a sticky residue.  This cream does none of the above and yet I've noticed a major reduction in the appearance of wrinkles and crows feet.  I also had a lot of dryness around my eyes which disappeared within just a few days of using this cream.  It's very pleasant to use and effective.",

My under eyes look exactly the same (did a side by side of my own face). I'll give this product another month of consistent use and if my overall experience changes, I'll change my review (As of 4/11/2021). \n\nI will say this: I read a lot of reviews that talks about an odor to the cream itself. To me, I do not smell a thing. I'd almost describe this product as odorless. \n\nAlso, if price is an issue for you, the little jar WILL last you a long time. I could see an individual getting roughly several months of use with just this one little jar.",

After reading many of the reviews I decided to try this product when it was on sale. I have noticed a huge difference in my under eye area. The skin is much more supple and I notice fewer lines. Also really helps when my under-eye area is puffy. My eye area is very sensitive but this cream does not bother me at all. I wish I could use it on my eyelids but it makes my eyeshadow crease even when I use a base. Also makes my mascara leave black dots on my eyelids. But at night I can use it all over my eye area and they look so great in the morning. Even though this cream is pricey (3 times what I was paying for Olay), I don't need to use very much cream to get the benefit so this will last a long time. Also I'm seeing results so it makes sense to put my money in a product that works.",

I'm going on 40 in a few more months. I've tried so many eye creams, serums, Etc (I always try each one several different ways to give a fair shot...morning, night, under make up, with no make up...if I can see a result Great! But I've always seen little or no results...nothing to jump for joy about even with creams/serums in the $150 range). This cream is it!! My first review was a day after using this eye Cream (I know, that's a little soon to write a review but I honestly saw results in the crows feet and wrinkles starting to peek out under my eyes quickly). However, been about months and I am so excited for finding this cream now! For any of the negative reviews I'm thinking its maybe because it was applied in the morning? Or possibly under make up? This cream is pretty thick and luxurious, I do not recommend at day or under make up personally (tried that and I feel it works at its best potential at night). After several experiments the winning way I found to use it is as a eye mask at night! I apply a decent amount under each eye..but (this is important) do not rub it in all the way...I apply it in a mask like manner (it will look like a thin white layer under your eyes, also covering the crows feet area) and let it sink in overnight...I wake up in AM and WOW. My eyes are absolutely firmer and brighter in the morning. The crows feet that had been very visible in pictures for over a year now (seriously) are GONE. So impressed. I've bought two back ups and plan and getting one more this week. Use it this way. It WORKS!!!",

        "comments": "I'm 55, with good skin (the reward for oily skin in my teens and 20's) but have wrinkles in my undereye area that I try to minimize.  I will invest in a pricey product if it works, and the reviews here convinced me to try it. After using it day and night for two months, I returned it.  It made my undereye area drier, and my crinkles and wrinkles were more visible, especially under concealer.  I even tried different concealers, and setting powder vs. no setting powder, but I am convinced that it was this cream.  I went back to Mario Badescu Hyaluronic Eye Cream for a third of the price.  Looks much better.",
