        "comments": "This product did a great job at dealing with product buildup in my hair. I wear braid in my hair constantly and taking out my braids every time would be a hassle for me as my hair would be constantly tangled and a lot of product would be built up towards to roots of my hair since I'm always using gels. But using this product, it made it much more easier to detangle my hair and also was very effective with getting rid of the heavy buildup on my roots. After sectioning my hair, I sprayed about 4-8 times of the spray on my hair and messaged it in. After that I went ahead and combed out my hair like I normally do and you can instantly see just how much of the product came out. It felt like it melted the product off like butter. I did do a couple of rounds of spraying on my head to make sure it would be easier for wash. But it still did the job just as much if you just sprayed in on the very first time. Not only that, but the spray has very nice cooling effect on the scalp. It reminds me of peppermint and it has a tingling effect at the beginning but after using it my scalp feels very free almost. The smell of the product also isn't too noticeable and overpowering in the hair. For people who aren't much fans of minty smells I would say this product does a great job in handling that as the product itself settles in the hair, and leaves a subtle smell that's very manageable and not overwhelming.",

        "comments": "The product itself was not bad, but not necessarily great either. The smell was pleasant and seemed to have some soothing ingredients. I can't say that I noticed too much of a difference in my scalp. The biggest issue was in the packaging was very off putting. It was very sloppy and confusing. The outside of the container was sticky and had some type of residue of adhesive. The bottle was being sealed, to prevent leaks I presume, by black electrical tape. I don't mind start up companies, but I truly wasn't expecting such sloppy packaging.",
