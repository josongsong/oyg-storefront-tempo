The AM moisturizer is lightweight, keeps my face hydrated and not greasy feeling, and absorbs well; I use 2, rarely 3, pumps and have plenty of product. A little goes a long way. As far as the pilling other reviews have mentioned, make sure you're giving it enough time to absorb into your skin before using other products and exfoliating/dermaplaning also helps with the application. I've had maybe ONE bad bottle that did this since I started using this brand, and doing the above remedied the problem. Can't recommend CeraVe enough!",

Everyone has such different skin and I may have stayed away from this product once I read those, I'm glad I didn't! For reference: I am 44, acne prone, with dark skin and have eczema -- I'm allergic to a lot of products.  I am also using a product for my acne called Tazorac so sunscreen is a necessity.  I found this product to rub in well, it feels good, does not irritate, and I didn't feel like I had that white film you often get with sunscreens.  I wear under make up and my make up goes on smoothly after.  I do wait about 10 min post shower to put the lotion on, and wait until after I do my hair to apply my make up which I think helps with having it absorb and layering under make up.  (If I put on the lotion while my skin is damp, it doesn't absorb well, and if I apply my make up immediately after, I do feel like it's a bit too much).  I really like using this as it doesn't irritate with my eczema, moisturizes, does not cause break outs, contains the sunscreen I need and looks good under make up.",

        "comments": "If I could give this zero stars I would!  I bought this AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion because I ran out of my normal facial lotion during a business trip and had heard good things about CeraVe.   I was so mistaken.  Upon first application on my face the following day, it stung a little around my eyes but I just thought it was from lack of sleep due to traveling.  I used it again the following day and the same stinging happened but was a bit worse and was just around my eyes so I thought maybe I developed an issue with my L'Oreal eye moisturizer I have been using for a year.  So I tried the CeraVe again the third day, this time my whole face stung and I knew it was that moisturizer.  The following day I did not use the CeraVe but my eye area still stung very bad, started getting itchy and was tender.  That evening, my right eyebrow and eyelid area swelled up and the skin around both eyes felt raw.  The 2nd day after last use, my right eye was swollen even more and the skin around my eyes and mouth felt raw, itchy and stung badly.  My eyes also watered a lot and made the skin sting and irritated even more.  The 3rd day after not using CeraVe, I woke up with both eyes swollen shut an my eye area and around my mouth felt rough and scabby, itchy and was very red.  The fourth day my eyes are still itchy, puffy and swollen, very red and the scabby skin is still scabby and starting to flake a little like I got a chemical burn.  I have taken a antihistamine each day since I stopped used the lotion and it has helped some but I am still experiencing the swelling, itchiness and red scabby raw skin. I cannot go to work looking like I went 10 rounds with Mike Tyson!   If you use this product, do a test on a small patch of your skin for a couple days first!!   I would like my money back on this product but I bought it while traveling and I am now home.",
