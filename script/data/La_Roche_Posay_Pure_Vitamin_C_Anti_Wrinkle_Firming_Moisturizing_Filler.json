The lotion was not tacky at all and  and left a glow on my skin all day long. I truly enjoyed using this cream and will definitely be purchasing in the future! The clean fresh feel kept me confident that my skin was absorbing the nutrients that this awesome product provided!",

Why did you discontinue the superior Active C10 instead of this sub par version? Or why not offer both?! Active C10 was the best face cream. I used it daily as my favorite face cream for 15+ years. My derm, esthetician and strangers complimented me on my skin. Most people prefer it over the 10% serum which discolors on face + in the bottle, is NOT moisturizing, evaporates, doesn't last long + forces users to add another step to moisturize on top of it. Active C10 was both therapeutic and moisturizing. Please bring back Active C10. Loyal Active C10 users will now SWITCH to another brand.",
