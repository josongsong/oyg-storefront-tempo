It will crimp your hair if the straightener is kept in one spot a little too long, so you have to work fast. It's not great for curling because of the crimping, but it will do the job. I do like that the cord is long because it allows me to move around with it.",

It is a GREAT straightening iron, though I am not used to the titanium plates, it did snag my hair when I tried to use it to curl my hair. It didn't really work for curling which is what i use it for mostly. I will say great iron if your looking to straighten your hair, maybe not so much curl it.",
