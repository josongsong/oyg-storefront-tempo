I do plan to use this for the summer, but will for sure go back to the original once I've completed this bottle.",

        "comments": "I've been using the e.l.f. Holy Hydration! Face Cream with SPF and honestly, I love it. It's super hydrating without being heavy or sticky, and it doesn't feel like you're wearing sunscreen at all—which is rare. It feels just like a nice face cream, not tacky or greasy like some SPF products.\n\nOne of my favorite things about it is how easy it is to reapply. I like to reapply sunscreen throughout the day, so having it in this cream format just makes sense—it's convenient and feels good on the skin. The fragrance is subtle and pleasant, and it leaves my skin looking fresh and healthy.\n\nFor me, this works even better than a skin tint with SPF. With skin tints, you usually need to apply a thick layer to get proper sun protection, and that just ends up looking off, especially on textured or acne-prone skin like mine. With this cream, I can just apply my regular amount, get hydration and sun protection, and then spot-conceal any areas if I want extra coverage.\n\nI have sensitive, acne-prone, and textured skin, and this cream hasn't irritated it at all. I don't wear makeup every day, but I do wear this every single day. It's become a staple in my routine.",

While it is not the richest moisterizer, which I prefer for night time, it is great for day time use, especially for oily skin. It's very light and airy, and super hydrating. My skin feels like it takes a big drink of water when I use this. I have combination skin and a history of cystic acne, and find this to be good fo sensitive skin and doe snot clog pores or feel heavy. The reason I am rating this 4/5 is because I think it could be slightly richer. I seem to go through this jar more frequently than other moisterizers.",
