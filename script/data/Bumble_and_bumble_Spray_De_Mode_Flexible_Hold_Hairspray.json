        "comments": "•Not a free product•\n I bought this, I didn't receive it for free in exchange for a review so this may be a bit longer of a review but worth reading because this spray is expensive! \n This hairspray is great the first day I wash my hair. I need to reapply it throughout the day sometimes because It's not a strong hold. It does dry my hair out and flakes off when I comb through my hair. The scent is strong but not overpowering. It does get sticky in my hair if I use a lot of it before I wash my hair again. If the sprayer gets clogged and the product won't spray out you'll need to run it under warm water or clean the gluey sticky stuff off of the sprayer. The cap has a adjustable feature where you can turn it and close off the spray part of the bottle, if you leave it open its less likely to clog up. It only has clogged up a couple of times but is annoying when it does. 3 stars because it's a 'clean ingredient' product. It's expensive and I feel like perhaps there's better options out there but I haven't found one yet so I keep forking out my hard earned $ for this stuff.",

I have a little bit of natural wave to my hair (very little...but its definitely there) and this stuff really emphasizes it. Gives the ends of my hair that turned out definition. It really looks super sexy.\n\nI am also always in a battle to give my hair some volume....and after adding some volumizer, heat protectant, and lightweight serum, blowdrying with a round brush, then finishing with this hairspray, my hair looks freaking gorgeous and feels super soft...and thanks to this spray, the results last all day long. :D",

It got to the point where I wasn't able to clean/rinse it out and had to throw away a half-used can. :( I won't be purchasing again unless the nozzle is fixed!",
