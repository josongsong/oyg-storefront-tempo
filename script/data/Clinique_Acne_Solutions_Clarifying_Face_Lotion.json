        "comments": "okay so i've been offically using this 3 step acne line for almost a month now. The toner really burns me i don't know how else to incorporate it into my skin care routine. i usually wash my face in the shower with the foaming cleanser from this line, then i take a cotton ball and very lightly swipe scross my face with the exfoliater. It finally got so bad my forhead turned red and swollen and was VERY tight i started to cry a lot. \n\nyes i did start off with the toner every other day/week because it was 2 strong for me personally but i haven't been using it on my forhead at all anymore i am traumatized. I think it \"works\" but harshly very harsh. My acne is getting better but its like in exchange for no more acne i am getting so much texture all over my face that i did not have before. Various little white bumps are spreading all over my chin/mouth area i am honestly so defeated. I am gonna try to use the rest of these products because they were expensive to buy all together at full size. I recommend these ONLY if you are okay with purging a lot before it gets better :(",

I ran out of it a few months ago and didn't use it for about two weeks, and my acne got so bad. I picked it up again at Ulta and oh my gosh it cleared so fast.\nPros: clears acne super quickly, removes makeup pretty well, prevents acne and clears pores and blackheads\nCons: it does dry out my skin but I don't find it to be a huge problem for me personally because I just apply moisturizer after using. It's also kind of expensive but it's Clinique and imo it's so worth it\n\nI DEFINITELY recommend this!!",

        "comments": "So i ordered this product online without reading the description. I was expecting an actual LOTION not liquid. However, since it was pricey and im desperate to relieve my acne,  i decided to try it. Id definitely call this more of a \"toner\" bc you apply with a cotton ball and its a bottle of liquid.  I will say that it makes my skin feel soooo soft and is not overdrying. I was looking for an acne treatment moisturizing lotion, but i am surprised and delighted with the benefits. I have used it twice already on my skin and neck and my skin feels soooo soft and smooth and its definitely shrinking the blemishes i have. Although i was initially disaapointed its not a \"lotion\" i am pleased with the effectiveness and will more than likely purchase again. Once it dries on your skin, id recommend throwing a moisturizer on top to prevent excess drying out.",

From foundation, to hair serums, to body washes, I love trying new things!\nI've also suffered from acne for as long as I can remember. I've had cystic acne for over 20 years (I'm 35 years old now). I've seen at least 5 different dermatologists and have tried everything from Accutane, to lotions and creams, to expensive laser treatments at my doctor's office. I seriously felt like I had tried everything, and just wanted to give up and accept the fact that I'd have adult acne for the rest of my life.\nThen one day, I was browsing the internet and came across this product. Since I had never tried it before, I thought I'd give it a try.\nMy daily routine consists of washing my face with a sonic cleansing brush in the morning with a mild cleanser (the Clinique Foaming Sonic Facial Soap). Then, after I wash my face, I apply this toner with a cotton pad. I follow that step with my Clinique Moisture Surge Moisturizer. Then, I apply all of my makeup.\nI follow the same steps at night before bed, removing all of the makeup on my face. I like the fact that this toner helps snag any leftover makeup that my cleanser/brush might've missed (like around the ear and chin areas).\nMy face is the clearest it's been in close to 20+ years....seriously. I don't think I've ever written a product review online, but I've been so incredibly happy with the results I received from this, I just HAD to share my story with anyone who was considering purchasing this product and may be on the fence. Please - just give it a try and see for yourself. I'm pretty sure you'll be just as happy as I am with the results!",

I have used the Clinique Clinical Clearing gel for years and love it! I still get hormonal breakouts on my chin though and thought this would help if I added it along with the clearing gel. I'm so glad I only used this on a patch of my skin at first. \n\nI dabbed a soaked cotton ball of this on the one big pimple I had for a few days..I felt like it worked to keep the head at bay. But then over the course of the next few days that area of my chin broke out SO bad. I'm not talking little white heads either...big painful, red bumps that take days to calm down. Maybe it was purging as I've read about that before...but the painful, extremely red line of pimples was too much for me to take. My skin has never looked so bad, I wanted to go into hiding.\n\nIt seems this product does work for a lot of people, but definitely not for me. My advice if you really want to try is to only do a SMALL patch of skin for the first few weeks :(",
