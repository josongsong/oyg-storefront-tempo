Every shade is gorgeous and blends easily for the perfect smoky eye!\nI've been using another palette by the brand, and I love the formulations because the pigment is amazing. I use an eyeshadow primer which is THE KEY to a long-lasting, creaseless look. It all prevents fallout and drastically improves blending and pigment.\nOverall, this palette is amazing and at this price, it can't be beat. (Plus it's made in the US)",

This pallette, a good warm tone paette and some travel or magnetic pallettes and you're good to go! This is a solid everyday day-to-night winner.",

I love that there are so many cool tones in this, which has been very hard to find since 2019. Most of the colors are very nice and easy to blend. A few shades do not have much pigment to them. The black can also feel a little chalky and doesn't seem to last all day if used as eyeliner. One thing that kind of annoys me is that some of these shades are so similar to another in the palette that it's fairly redundant to include both. Aside from these very minor issues, I've been very happy with it and have used it almost every day since purchase. The Colourpop formula isn't my favorite - my first foray into Colourpop eyeshadows was the Sailor Moon collab, which was not great - but I've been pleased enough with the formulations here.",

Then the color pay off is so light that you reaply havento paxk it on to see any pay off. A lot of the colors are also very similar to each other, they could have totally put more variety but its just so boring and bland. It just isnt for me, it was a totaly waste of my money. I usually love colourpop but this formula is just to powdery and doesnt have that same buttery feel when you apply. Just dont do it.",
