A bold,sexy red lip is the perfect color for Valentine's or any day in my humble opinion. The sleek gold case includes the intials EL engraved on the cap.Plus,the cap is magnetic which is a feature that I love.The lipstick itself also has the intials engraved with a lovely design along the sides.When a lipstick is this pretty you hate to mess it up. While unboxing I noticed that it states, \"refillable\" This is a feature that I have not personally used, but it is a nice option. The lipstick glides on smoothly and offers full coverage on your lips with one application.Due to the creme consistency and moisture complex your lips certainly feel moisturized and cared for. I used a lip primer to try and prevent bleeding, however I still encountered feathering/slight bleeding of the color. I hate to report that I also did not find it to be very long lasting.You will need to reapply throughout the day.The color is more of an orange red and I tend to prefer a more blue toned red. I did not dislike the color,just a personal preference. I will say that it does not feel as dry as other lipsticks.Due to the various oils of the moisture complex it does leave your lips feeling more moisturized than you might expect from a lipstick. If you are looking for a sexy,bold lip full of moisturizing benefits then give this a try. After all,carnal may be your only sexy accessory needed...go ahead and leave your mark!",

Rich color, long-lasting, softening, comfortable. \n\nHowever, the case feels very lightweight and cheap compared to the previous lipstick line (Pure Color Envy) that this appears to have replaced. The previous lipstick cases had a high-quality, heavy weight to them and were almost like collectible keepsakes. This case feels like a drugstore lipstick that would be less than half the price. Recently with inflation, I've noticed not only prices of  all types of products increasing, but also quality plummeting. \n\n@Estée Lauder - you have been one of the most reliable beauty brands for a long time. Please don't follow this trend of companies cutting corners on quality, charging the same (or higher) prices, trying to pass something off as the same product (when it's not), and hoping customers won't notice (we do!). You may cut costs in the short term, but you will lose formerly loyal customers in the long run. I want to be able to trust this brand.",
