        "comments": "I really love this Cleansing Oil! It's most definitely a splurge item for me because it's a bit pricey, but very nice to use. The smell is relaxing and the oils in this do not irritate my sensitive skin whatsoever. What surprised me the most was that it really is a deep cleansing oil. After applying a salicylic acid lotion to my skin before the gym, I used this to remove it afterwards and I was shook at how many blackheads, and CC's this oil pulled out. I honestly thought my skin WAS pretty unclogged! I massaged it into my dry skin for about 2-3 minutes before I could feel all the grit being released. Kept massaging for about 10 total for a good cleansing. I have skin that gets congested easily, and oil cleansing helps so much. I absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for an oil cleanser. It is a thin oil so I like to use 5 pumps to ensure I'm using enough to saturate my skin. I choose not to use it as a makeup remover because it is so expensive and I feel like I need to use a lot to break down the makeup. That could just be me. As a double cleanse or deep oil cleanse… this is really great! Soft skin. No irritation.",

I was apprehensive to use it, as I have never used an oil as a face wash before. However, after recently starting to use retinol, my skin has been dry and peeling, and I was willing to use anything that could help provide some relief. I was very pleasantly surprised at how wonderful this smelled, how gentle it was on my skin, and how un-oily it was! It even took off my eye makeup and did not cause any pain in my eyes whatsoever. It was extremely gentle, and was very similar to the Dermalogica pre-wash face wash, which essentially dissolves your makeup. I still used a foaming cleanser afterwards, but this was such an excellent product to gently get everything off my face, and I think you would be fine using it alone as a face wash or makeup remover.",

        "comments": "I don't understand how so many people think this product is great. I've been using it since June and haven't been able to get over the weird, rancid-like smell it has. I can smell the \"botanical\" aspect, but there's also something really funny about it, and it's not good. \n\nThis product will remove face makeup fine, but it will not remove my eye makeup (tested with Benefit Rollerlash, which is difficult to remove — so I had low expectations, but also it couldn't remove my Smashbox Full Exposure and cannot remove Fenty eye primer). When putting it all over the eyes as needed to remove makeup, it will seek into the eyes because it's so thin, and it will sting. When I use it before bed, I wake up with very irritated, uncomfortable eyes. \n\nAdditionally, the product is very, very thin, making it slightly more difficult to apply than other cleansing oils or mills as it runs down your hands so quickly. I think this is partly why it gets in the eyes. It washes away nicely enough, doesn't get milky at all (if you don't like that) or leave any residue. Once my face dries, I have to immediately scurry to my moisturizer because my face is immediately so tight and dry.\n\nLastly, I got the full-size bottle, and although it has a twist cap for on/off, it WILL leak in your luggage. I have also tried putting it into other containers for travel, but you must make sure that they're a good liquid container. I've had it seep out of other containers with screw lids; the thin slippery formula can just go through them! \n\nI'm going back to Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil. I so wish I had not purchased the full size of this Kieh's product. What a waste! :(",
