NYX lip pencils will forever be my go-to!",

However the Sky Glitter and Silver Glitter are just plain awful. The points break off immediately upon contact, even with the barest touch. I also found them difficult to sharpen. I'm willing to try many of the other colors though I'll hesitate before trying another of the glittery ones.",
