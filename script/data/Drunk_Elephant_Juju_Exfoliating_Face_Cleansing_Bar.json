I was thrilled with the packaging until I got the the final ‚Äúunveiling‚Äù. Everything was paper based except the bar was wrapped in a thin layer of plastic. Get rid of this plastic and it‚Äôs easily five stars for me. Unfortunately, packaging is part of the product and therefore factors into the rating.",

I'm not sure if it was just the batch I got but they both feel like they leave a film on my face and dont actually clean it. They do not feel the same as the travel duo I received so maybe I just got some bad bars, hence the two stars:(",
