It's insanely comfortable, glides on so smoothly and effortlessly. The only thing I would change, is I would prefer it to be a roll up version, sharpening isn't the easiest. Regardless of sharpening, this is my top lip liner! Super inexpensive!!!!",

It doesn't last at all; as soon as I eat or drink something, it completely wears off. On top of that, the tip keeps breaking off, which means I'm constantly having to sharpen it and wasting a lot of product. Really disappointed because this used to be my go-to.",

You have to use a particularly light touch to avoid breaking it and even then, it tends to still break early on. I havent yet tried sharpening mine. For the price, id still recommend this as this is the best color match ive found to my lips",

        "comments": "I have been searching for the perfect nude lip liner for a really long time and was never satisfied because no matter what brand I tried they would either be way to dark or way to light. I came across this one when I was searching for a different one and I fell in love. It is my perfect nude shade and goes with so many of my lipsticks. I mostly wear varying nude shades, or light pinks and this goes with all of them. The point does dull pretty quickly, but with a quick sharpen it is ready for action once again. For the price you can't beat it. It is a super creamy formula and doesn't drag across your lips at all when you are applying. Also, if you don't want to wear lipstick you can go ahead and line your lips with this pencil and then fill them in with it. Then I use my finger to diffuse it a little bit. All the lip liners from Colourpop have such a great formula and I love all of them. I am so glad that Ulta carries this brand now.",

        "comments": "Received this in the mail about a little over a week ago and tried it a few days after. Wore it for most of the day and evening with lip gloss over it, but when I took my makeup off that night my lips hap little bumps all over. The bumps were mostly on the outer edges of my lips where I applied the majority of the lippie pencil and then a few on the res rod my lip since I blended it out with my finger. I put a thick lip balm on hoping by morning they would be fine and they were worse. This time it hurt to even take big bites of food like my lips were sore or something.. The irritation and bumps on my lips took about a week to completely heal and go away on their own.. Its unfortunate this happened I have been excited to try these out and have heard nothing but good things about the product. Be careful if you have really sensitive skin..",
