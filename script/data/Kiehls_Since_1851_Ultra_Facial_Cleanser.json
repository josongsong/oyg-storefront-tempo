I've used it for a couple of years now and find it always leaves my face feeling squeaky clean and refreshed. I can definitely see how it could be drying, like other reviews have said, but I follow it up with a pretty hydrating skincare routine and my skin feels clean, bouncy and fresh after. I have sensitive combo skin, can be prone to closed comedones, and I don't think this has ever aggravated my skin. I don't use this as my only cleanser - I use a cold cream to take my makeup off first and then use this after, so I don't know how effective it would be for removing makeup on its own. All in all, it gives me a lovely experience and is one of the very few skincare products I keep going back to.",
