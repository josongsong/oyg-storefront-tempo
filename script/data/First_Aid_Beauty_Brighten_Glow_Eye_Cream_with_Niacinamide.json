This started within a few days of starting it and only ended a couole of days of stopping it. I have absolutely no history of such an issue. To test if the eye cream was the cause, I resumed use afyer several days of stopping and the twitching immediately started up. Very unusual but I'm guessing its the caffeine in the cream.",

        "comments": "It has a great peachy tint to it, a smooth texture that absorbs easily and helps keep the skin around my eye moisturized all day. I can see immediate brightening, and some depuffing. \n\nFor those, like me, with more texture around the eye area though this is a bit too shimmery, it draws attention to the texture versus concealing it.  \n\nIf you are dealing with dark circles, mild puffiness, looking for wrinkle care and hydration this is a nice eye cream, if you have bags under your eyes, or more pronounced puffiness this may not be a good fit for you. Which is fine, every product can't work for every concern. \n\nThank you FAB team for sending me this to try.",

        "comments": "This is a great moisturizing eye cream that did reduce puffiness. A very unexpected issue was that the caffeine in it caused my muscles around my eye to twitch. This started within a few days of starting it and only ended a couole of days of stopping it. I have absolutely no history of such an issue. To test if the eye cream was the cause, I resumed use afyer several days of stopping and the twitching immediately started up. Very unusual but I'm guessing its the caffeine in the cream.",
