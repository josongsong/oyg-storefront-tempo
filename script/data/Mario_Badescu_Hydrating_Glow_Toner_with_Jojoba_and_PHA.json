No need, would only waste product and just not necessary. Only put a dime worth size in your hands and gently rub into skin. A little goes a long way. This is not a typical toner. It is thicker than water, but far from a lotion. It literally melts right into your skin leaving the most glowy,  beautiful, natural skin. Dries like normal. No residue, so leaves room for a serum or moisturizer. I typically purchase based on reviews but ran with it because of price point. Lastly, this smells like absolute heaven in the mildest scent.
