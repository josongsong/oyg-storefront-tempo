My skin doesn't tolerate many products well and it's on the dry side, so I wasn't expecting these to really be all that moisturizing. They really are though, and they give skin this beautiful glass glow. My skin loved them and they helped keep it clear and smooth. definite HG, the only product from them I really feel makes a difference.",
