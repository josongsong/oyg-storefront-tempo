        "comments": "I received this product free to try in exchange for my honest review. The packaging is appealing. It came in a box which was the signature Clinique green color and showed what the jar would look like. The jar itself is attractive with a heavy pink glass container and a silver lid. The glass is quite thick, so I feel like there's good protection against the jar breaking if I were to accidentally drop it. There's also a plastic lid that goes directly onto the product once the jar is open to help keep it from drying out. I really wish the product came with an applicator, especially for when it starts to get towards the bottom of the jar, so I wouldn't have to scrape it from the bottom. The product itself is pretty thick and smooth. It definitely has the scent of sunscreen because of the SPF, but it's not what I would consider unpleasant. The product applies smoothly onto the skin and I didn't notice any white cast after application. The product dries down quickly enough and doesn't feel greasy or heavy on the skin. That being said, this product does not feel all that hydrating for me. Compared to some other moisturizing products I've used, this was a let down when it comes to hydration. I would definitely recommend using another moisturizer before applying this. On its own, my skin felt dry again within less than 3 hours after using this product. I also think the amount of SPF is also a letdown at only SPF 28. SPF 50 is the baseline recommendation. With the product being in the glass jar, it's not really practical to carry around with me in my purse to reapply throughout the day as recommended with SPF products. I did try wearing this under my makeup, and I didn't experience any problems with layering my makeup on top of this product. Overall, this product is decent but nothing groundbreaking. I would absolutely suggest you need to wear another moisturizer under this product. I would personally want to add additional SPF products as well for more effective coverage.",
