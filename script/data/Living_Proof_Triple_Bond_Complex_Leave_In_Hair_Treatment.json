It does not necessarily condition my hair or have that immediate wow effect. I still need my leave-in and oil afterwards. What it does do is make my hair much stronger!  Now, when I stop using this, my hair feels weaker. Try this, but give it time.",

I do old-money blonde, heat protect like my life depends on it, and sleep in protective styles. I had washed and conditioned my hair and it felt like satin.  Buttah.  I put this in my damp, clean hair and immediately it turned to straw and my usual slippery comb through my hair was like battling the thick jungle brush with a plastic spork.  I'm sure it probably does improve hair quality and keep it strong - but don't expect it to make your hair feel like silk.  Maybe after you wash it again.",

The 2nd time, with blow dryer heat on day-old misted hair, I used 8 pumps. The 2nd time, it took longer to dry my hair than it usually would with the blow dryer, and I worried that I had put too much on, but at the end of really drying it, my hair looked fine. Both times, I applied the product on the lower 2/3rds of my hair. Because I'm seeing a notable positive change, I'm tempted to do it even yet again on 2nd-day-old hair with the misting again! Had I blown it dry the first application, my results so far would like have been even greater!\n\nIt's worth it to at least try this, IMHO, and to apply the heat to get the best results. I am more than happy with my results, particularly because most things do nothing to improve my hair that I can tell. The idea of having strong hair without constant split-ends and breakage was one I had mostly given up on. (I eat well, sleep on satin or silk pillowcases, use gentle shampoo & conditioning products, apply protectants, leave-ins, and oils, usually air dry my hair, use special soft hair towels, wide tooth combs, etc., and my hair still doesn't look great, but now it looks better!)",

This is a leave-in hair repair treatment, triple bond complex that is suppose to make your hair stronger, smoother, and shinier after just one use.  Unfortunately that is not the result I got.  My hair didn't feel smoother, or shinier, it felt dry and it felt in worse condition than what it had been in.   I was really expecting this product to have a better result.  The packaging is nice, with a pump.\nIt is odd that we are only suppose to use it once a week, for being a leave-in.  I didn't wait a week to try it again.  I tried a few days later to see if I would give me a different result.  I still got the same result, not shiny or smooth, but dry!  It does say this product does not require heat but that we will see best results with heat activation!  I mean maybe that would smooth my hair out but it still shouldn't make my hair feel worse than what it was, right!?  Plus I don't want to have to put heat on it just to get the product to WORK!\nI love other Living Proof products, so yes this was a let down for me!",
