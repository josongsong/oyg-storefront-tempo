After just under 2 months of daily use, with well over half the product remaining, I decided to do a side by side comparison and I was BLOWN AWAY. I can't believe how much of a difference I see in the fine lines around my eyes. I was kind of convinced all firming skincare was a gimmick and only fillers would fix my wrinkles one day, so I can't believe the results I got. And for this price point?? Absolutely unbelievable and unbeatable.\n\nI currently use this product 2x a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. I apply it after my serums but before my moisturizer.",

        "comments": "So, firstly I can say that I truly appreciate that this is a pump dispenser. I HATE digging my finger in a jar! Second, this formula is quite nice. There's no prevalent scent so there shouldn't be any sensitivities with it, and it's made with clean ingredients.. DOUBLE plus! I have pretty finicky skin, so I can also attest to no breakouts wile using this! ...TRIPLE PLUS! One thing I REALLY appreciate about this eye gel is that it glides on smooth/silky and soaks in super quickly. I have eyelash extensions, and I find that if my eye cream just sits on top of my skin, it affects my retention.. No bueno. As for the performance, I feel like this is very hydrating and with consistent usage, I do notice that my under eye appears visibly more hydrated and \"awake,\" leaving my under eye creases are pretty minimal. & As for the under eye creases, I can truly appreciate this when it comes to makeup application. (I'm an oily girl so I have to powder it DOWN.. so this can get rough if my eye bags aren't Gucci.) In conclusion, you can't really beat the price on this especially for the performance. I really enjoy this eye cream and I'll be replenishing when I'm out!",

        "comments": "So i actually used this on my neck wrinkles, not on my eyes. But so far, it seems to have helped a little bit. Consistency seems to be key. Seems like you need to use it every day. It definitely isnt a \"miracle\" product, it wont completely erase wrinkles, but for me, it did make them slightly less noticeable / prominent, so that was nice. I would say for that result, the price is a little high for me, so thats why i didnt give it 5 stars. I would probably switch to something else once this runs out (hopefully something that can work better?)",
