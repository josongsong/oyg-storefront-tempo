The wand is thick, and the mascara sticks to the wand which causes a clumpy application. The worst part is how flaky it is. I had flakes like I've never had with any other mascara. I wish I had waited to purchase until reviews were out. I bought way too early.",

        "comments": "I love Dibs products and use their contour stick daily but this mascara is definitely a product i should've returned. I wanted to try it for the tubing primer but after i applied it and went about my day, it started flaking and smudging under my eyes. I also noticed it's very hard to coat the ends of your lashes with the primer brush. I find that at the end of the day the mascara is all the way off the ends of my upper lashes and looks like i wore it to sleep for the night by the end of the day.  I definitely will not buy this again as it doesn't prove to be lengthening for me, just thickening and i do not like the wear of it overtime.",

It comes off super easily at night (no scrubbing or panda eyes). It honestly feels like two products in one, and I love having the option to go natural or bold with just one duo.

        "comments": "This mascara is probably the best \"new\" beauty item I've tried in a while. I have long lashes, but they are light in color and are hard to see with my hooded eyelids. But with this mascara, it looks like I have extensions they are so long and lovely. The brown primer goes on so smoothly, with just one coat needed. With that alone you get incredible length and no clumping. I am typically skeptical of primers because you can't see where they have/have not applied, and there are usually some clumps. But this application is so easy (even though I was skeptical when I saw the actual applicator) and wearing the brown primer alone would be perfect for a \"no makeup\" look. However, if you want lashes that pop and will have people asking what you use/have done to your lashes, then all you need is one coat of the black mascara. The addition of the black mascara gives you even more length and great volume. Truly, these lashes cannot be ignored because they are so bold and beautiful. I am very picky about mascara, both in terms of the actual product and the applicator. I was really worried about the applicator for both the primer and the mascara, but these seem to really work with the product. A little goes a long way with the black mascara, so applying in one light coat at a time is the best way to get volume without any lashes sticking together. If you like to put on several coats and have a few lashes that stick, a qtip or a disposable/clean spoolie will easily separate them and give you the most stunning lashes ever. I've been super dedicated to my tubing mascara for years now, and was worried about using something that isn't tubing (the primer is, but the masara isn't). However, I was pleasantly surprised to see that I have had absolutely no flaking with this product, even after a full day of wear with temps in the mid-90s and high humidity. If you like bold lashes then this is the product for you. Having both products in one is also amazing for travel, or for generally cutting down on space. I am so glad that I was given the opportunity to try this through Gloss Angeles Confidential. I am officially a Dibs mascara girl, and this is my #1 beauty find of the year (if not longer)!!",

        "comments": "The versatility of this mascara is unmatched. You get the soft clean girl no makeup makeup aesthetic with the brown primer side, the glam with the black side, and the full beat with both combined. The brown also is a tubing formula so even better for those effortlessly chic days as it comes off easily and mess free. With the black side I definitely noticed some volumizing and fluffing of my lashes, and with both combined I got my longest most voluminous results. That being said I felt this mascara really wasn't enough for me in terms of lengthening. I have fairly long lashes naturally but I'm able to get them super long usually with one coat of mascara. However with this mascara I got almost no extra length. In fact with the brown priming side only I could hardly tell I was wearing mascara. I was able to get more voluminous thick lashes with the black and brown combined, and also the black alone, but really only a moderate amount of volume at best. Also when using the black side I would get some slight clumping with or without the priming brown side. I also noticed immediate flaking with the black on my lashes, although the flakes didn'tsmudge which was at least good. The formula also wasn't a super wet one which made it less messy but I feel also less effective. I think the concept is amazing of having one tube of mascara that does it all but I wish it provided more lengthening and a little less clumping and flaking. I think if you are looking for something for a more everyday look that's easy and convenient this will be more up your alley. I'm so grateful to have had the opportunity to test this product through Gloss Angeles Confidential!",
