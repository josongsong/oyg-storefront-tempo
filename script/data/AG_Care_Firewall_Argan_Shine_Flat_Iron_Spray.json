I have recently experienced problems with the spray nozzle, but I still love the product so much I was willing to put up with the issues. I have short, fine hair and even though I've seen reviews stating this doesn't work with my type of hair. I'm glad I already used the product, because I probably wouldn't have bought it after reading the reviews. I use it when my hair is still wet before blow drying. Then I spray again and before using my straightener. It seems to give my hair body and shine. Some days after blow drying I can even manage to style without using the straightener. I also spray a little after finishing my styling…after using hairspray. I really love this and feel ot is making my hair look and feel healthier. I don't want to ever run out!",

It works great, but its not worth the frustration. At first I thought it was an isolated case of a defective can, but i have tried 3-4 times over and every can leaks. Fix this and I'd be a fan.",

        "comments": "Let me just preface this review by saying this is NOT for thin/fine hair. It is quite literally an oil spray and has to be used very sparingly & intentionally. I have very wavy, frizzy hair and live in Florida. I used to envy strangers with perfect blowouts in this humidity and wonder how they did it… Look no further!! This product is amazing if used correctly. I use it with a thermal round brush to help the smoothing process and seal out frizz. Afterwards you can over over with a curling iron and finishing spray. The results are amazing i'm telling you!! If you have curly hair and live in a hot climate, this is a must have. Be careful though, a little goes a long way. If you over do it in some spots just just a little dry shampoo to soak up excess oil.",

        "comments": "I have used this for years and loved it. When I saw the new bottle I compared the ingredients. Changed. I don't know if it's the new formula or the spray nozzle (or both) but it leaks EVERYWHERE now. It runs down my arm. I rinse it multiple times during and after use in hot water which does little to help. I end up EVERY time giving up before I have enough on my hair because I am so stressed with the mess dripping off of my elbow and the water everywhere from frequent rapid rinsing in hot water. I have to leave the bottle on the counter all of the time because of the mess. It is a complete WASTE of money now. I will be moving on. AG, you knew better than this cheap switch. Most would be willing to pay more for the quality product we were used to. Save money elsewhere- not at the expense of quality. Fail.",
