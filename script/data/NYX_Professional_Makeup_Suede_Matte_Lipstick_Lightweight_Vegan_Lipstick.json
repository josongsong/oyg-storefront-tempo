Upon further research I came to the conclusion that it was the ingredients blooming. I do live in a hot humid environment which explains it. I have been wearing it and no problems have occurred. It feel light weight and moisturizing at the same time.",

The lipstick itself last all day long. The only downside is that it does transfer easily when you first apply, so blotting is a must! I prefer this lipstick over the more expensive brand.",

It does not look cheap, but I will say the price point really hits regarding moisture, or lack thereof, on mature skin. These lipsticks require a liner in order to prevent bleeding into fine lines, and can be drying with long wear. Not in any way a bad product, but not a $50 lipstick either. Fun for the price.",

It warmed to me and it wears nicely throughout the day. It's not a true matte. It appears matte, but I would say it's more of a satin. It transfers, even after hours of wear. The bullet gives a nice amount of product and the componenet is cute. Smells decadent, but not overpowering. Has no real taste if you get it in your mouth. Depending on activities, it may need reapplied every few hours. It doesn't bunch up or dry out the lips.",

I believe the best part of makeup is seeing it brand new for the first time untouched like opening up a brand new mascara and hearing that little 'pop'...Plus the made in China lingo should be printed someplace on the tube more inconspicuous...",
