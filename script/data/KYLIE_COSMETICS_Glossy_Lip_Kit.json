I went to Ulta the day it released not knowing it doesn't come to ulta until a coulle weeks later. I wanted it for a trip but ended up not being able to get it. I just recently got it and I love it! It's very easy to apply (coming from someone who's never used lip liner before) and the gloss has a soft feel making you feel like there's a cloud on your lips (it does feel soft). I recommend this product to everyone and anyone who's trying out lip kits for the first time!! I'm wishing I could get all of them, and I wish you could get it too! I got Dolce K and my bf loves it on me and wants me to get more.",

It leaned a little orange on me, which didn't pair as well with the pinker gloss. That might just be a personal preference though, because the formula itself worked nicely!\n\nThe gloss was definitely the star of the kit for me. The color was so pretty, it had a sweet scent, and it gave a nice amount of coverage. The texture felt comfortable and easy to wear, and overall it delivered a polished look! My only issue was the packaging. The lid kept coming loose in my purse, which made me nervous about spills. If that gets fixed, I think it would make a huge difference because the gloss itself is really enjoyable to use.\n\nOverall, I had fun trying this kit and I can see myself reaching for the gloss again. Even though the liner shade wasn't quite right for me, I love that the kit comes with both products. With a few packaging tweaks, this could be such a great everyday lip duo!",
