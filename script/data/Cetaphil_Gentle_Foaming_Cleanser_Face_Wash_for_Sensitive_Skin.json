The top of the pump is simply too smal to effectively use, especially when wet. There is no texture to the lid to aid in grip and the angle of the pump itself compounds the slippage. I have long fingers so that has nothing to do with it. I've even tried leaving it on the counter and using my palm....it ended up across the bathroom! I'm going to have to put the product in an empty foaming hand soap container to finish using it. If the container doesn't change I won't buy it again.",
