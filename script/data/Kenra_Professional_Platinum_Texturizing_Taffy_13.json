For years I tried every gel, spray, pomade, etc. anything that dries hard caused severe stress and damage to my hair and everything that stayed pliable was either too oily or too gummy into hair. I was shocked and absolutely HOOKED the very first time I used Kenra 13!!! It smells amazing!!! It holds every last frizzy hair in place with no fly aways and if I do happen to mess up my hair on the job I can still run a comb straight through it without it ripping my hair out since it doesn't dry hard! It washes out easily with warm water and no matter how long my day is it never leaves those white flakes like gels and sprays that' make you look like you have dandruff! Hands down the best hair product I've ever used and I don't think I will ever find anything better!!!",

It also sections pieces nice, but I'm the type of girl who runs her fingers thru her hair every now and then and my fingers would get stuck:( Too much hold for me and my heavy, thick hair looked unnatural.",
