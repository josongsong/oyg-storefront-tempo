        "comments": "I usually have to hunt for a polyethylene & cruelty-free cleansing balm, so when I saw Good Molecules released one, I hit the \"add to cart\" button immediately! They have become one of my favorite brands lately, anyway on to the review!\nThe packaging doesn't take up much room, is easy to use, and recyclable. I could easily find myself reusing the little tin after it is emptied. \nThe product has zero scent. Like, none whatsoever. If you are sensitive to fragrance, this is the balm for you. \nThe texture is really nice. Not too hard to scoop, but not too soft, and it melts with body heat easily. \nI have yet to find a makeup product this doesn't remove. Sunscreen, foundation, concealer, waterproof eyeliner, mascara, even super saturated eyeshadow & liquid lipstick. GONE! It takes a little bit of massaging of course (I find that part relaxing honestly) but I've definitely used far less effective balms before. \nI'd say a full face of makeup takes me about 20 seconds of massaging to remove, and another 10 seconds to rinse off. \nI like using the included spatula/scoop thing, and I only ever need to use a blob about an inch long for a full face of makeup. The whole tub lasts me about a month, and I use it 5 times a week.\nThis balm emulsifies easily into a milky looking liquid and rinses off quickly. \nIf you aren't familiar with cleansing balms, you are supposed to follow them with a second cleanser, but you could possibly get away with using this alone in a pinch because it doesn't seem to leave any greasy residue behind, but I always follow it with a water based cleanser like it is intended to be used, so I'm not positive how great that would be.\nHonestly the one flaw is sometimes it is tricky to close the tin completely. Usually I can't be bothered to screw the top on tightly, so I just put the plastic cover on over the product, and place the  aluminum top on loosely. Unless you are literally packing it up and taking it with you every single time you use it, I don't really see that being an issue.\n\nTLDR: If you are looking for a low-waste, cruelty-free, fragrance-free, and very effective cleansing balm, this is the best!",

        "comments": "I will not buy this again. I bought it for double cleansing, along with my regular cleanser, from a different brand. I was going to buy a more expensive cleansing balm that specifically removes waterproof makeup, but I fed into the reviews on this one. I'm going to assume now that none of the reviewers tried this on waterproof mascara or liquid/gel eyeliner, because it DOES NOT work on those - not even a little bit. So I ended up doing what I was trying to avoid - use an actual makeup remover then double cleansing. Aside from that issue this cleansing balm works fine for double cleansing (with another cleanser that's not from GM). But because of that, I will never buy this again since it doesn't work on waterproof makeup. Saying that, all of Good Molecules' cleansing products are woefully incapable of a proper cleanse or doing what they say. I say that as a faithful customer of GM - I use several of their treatments and serums and have done so for the past couple of years. But all of their cleansing products fall short every time I try one. Everything else is great.",
