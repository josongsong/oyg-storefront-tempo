I tried tons of expensive acne face washes and topical solutions, but nothing made a difference. The only things that have made a difference are this moisturizer and Cetaphil daily face wash... my acne is almost completely gone now!\n\nA month ago I asked a close friend of mine to do my makeup for an event - she is very knowledgeable about skincare/good skincare products in general.  I brought all of my makeup products to her house and she asked, \"where is your moisturizer?\"  ...being the most clueless person about skincare ever, I told her I didn't use one. She was horrified to say the least! So she looked through her products and whipped out this e.l.f. moisturizer fresh out of the box.  She applied it with a brand new foundation brush, so it felt like I was getting a facial! It made my skin feel so good and it did not leave it feeling greasy at all. My skin absorbed it so quickly! My fear had always been that a moisturizer would make me break out even more and leave my skin feeling greasy. This moisturizer did exactly the opposite. The best part is the wonderful scent! It's such a fresh, clean smell. The packaging is really nice/high quality as well. I highly recommend this product!!",
