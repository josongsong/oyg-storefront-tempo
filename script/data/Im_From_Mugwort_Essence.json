An excellent choice for people with se sitive or reactive skin and great for those who shave their face due to its soothing properties. With a light, almost slippery and non-sticky texture that makes it easy to layer, this is a non-negotiable in my routine.",

        "comments": "@imfrom_global Mugwort essence ✨️What it is? Its a soothing skincare product that repairs and provides an immediate feeling of comfort to the skin. ✨️Star ingredients Mugwort extract, also known as Artemisia princeps, is well known for treating and preventing acne by reducing skin inflammation and redness. We want an all-natural, clean beauty product, thus this one is created exclusively of 100% pure mugwort extract, which lowers the likelihood of reactions from other substances in the formulation ✨️How to use? Pour the essence into the palm of your hand and apply it directly onto your skin by patting it until fully absorbed. ✨️My experience To see if the I'm from mugwort essence lives up to the hype, I've been including it into my skincare routine for more than a week. If you've never used an essence in your routine, it is a cross between a toner and a serum that aids in moisturizing skin preparation and delivering the effects of concentrated essential components, in this case, mugwort extract. I enjoy how the Mugwort essence absorbs entirely into my skin without leaving a greasy behind. Those with oily and combination skin would prefer this more because, despite its consistency, it won't leave your skin greasy and, most likely, you'll feel that it provides adequate moisture for you. It has a strong herbal scent that is strongly reminiscent of \"oriental medicine. \" I use my hand to apply it. It's truly incredibly relaxing, and I've also used it numerous times as a \"mask\" (I soak cotton pads and keep them on my skin for a little while). All skin types would benefit from using this as a hydrating essence because of the additional relaxing properties of mugwort. You can always count on it to be your go-to product when your skin is acting up and needs to be reset. I advise anyone with sensitive skin to try this essence.",
