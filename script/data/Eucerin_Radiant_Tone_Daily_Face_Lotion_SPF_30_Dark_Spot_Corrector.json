        "comments": "Eucerin is a great brand that I have used with success for improving the texture and moisture of my dry skin. I am excited to use a formula for dark spots!\nScent: The sunscreen has a very sunscreen-y smell. It is overpowering for awhile, but becomes more manageable with wear.\nLook: It starts off with a very white cast. After carefully rubbing it in a minute or two it looks as though I have nothing on.\nFeel: It has a very creamy feel. It's not heavy like some sunscreens. Eurcerin lotion makes my skin so soft and helps with the dryness, which is why I wanted to try this.. My skin is just as soft as when I use their other lotions, but with the added bonus of protection from the sun.\nOverall 9/10\nThis review was for: Eucerin Radiant Tone Daily Face Lotion Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen, Dark Spot Corrector with Thiamidol, Helps Visibly Reduce the Look of Persistent Dark Spots, 1.7 Fl Oz Bottle and was provided by PinchMe free of cost for me to sample & review. #pinchme #eucerin #darkspots",

It was too thick/heavy for my skin, ( I have acne, oily skin so I'm very careful if a product is too heavy for my skin because it will within a couple days break me out ) I tried to use this product for a month to be able to give a thorough review but I started getting breakouts so I thought maybe 2 weeks? But the breakouts started becoming more & more & also it's heavily fragrance in my opinion & I don't like fragrance in my skincare ( I can do earthy, herbal, oats, etc but I prefer fragrance free, this one smells like straight florals ), the good thing is the scent did faint within a couple hours, I wanted to see if it helps with my dark spot since it says it's geared towards that but because of the breakouts & the scent I couldn't continue using it & ended up gifting to my mom who don't have a sensitive skin like mine & also I didn't feel it was moisturizing.",
