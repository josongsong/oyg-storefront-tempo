        "comments": "I recently tried the Lip + Cheek Cream Blush Stick, and I must say I am impressed by this multi-tasking product. The product claims to provide a natural flush of color to both lips and cheeks, and it certainly delivered on that promise.I love the convenience of having a product that can be used on both my cheeks and lips, and the cream formula blends easily into the skin, giving a subtle yet buildable color. I have used this product on my bare skin and over foundation, and it works well in both scenarios.One thing I particularly like about this product is that it has a creamy, lightweight texture that feels comfortable on the skin, without feeling sticky or greasy. It also has a pleasant, subtle scent that is not overwhelming.The shade range of this product is also impressive, with a variety of hues that cater to different skin tones. I personally love the \"Peachy\" shade, which gives me a warm, natural-looking flush of color.Overall, I would highly recommend the Lip + Cheek Cream Blush Stick to anyone looking for a versatile, easy-to-use product that delivers a natural-looking flush of color to both lips and cheeks. It's a bit on the pricier side, but the quality of the product justifies the price in my opinion.Gifted by Milk Makeup",

        "comments": "The product itself is so great - excellent pigmentation, buttery formula, blends perfectly. But the packaging is horrendously cheap. I have the lip and cheek stick, the bronzer stick, sculpt stick, and highlighter stick - this goes for all of them. When I received them, the tamper evident plastic cap on all of them took a huge chunk out of the product when removed. The turning mechanism at the bottom of the package that pushes up more product didn't work on two of the sticks that I received, and falls off of another one. It's hard to write this review because I love the product itself so much, but they really need to improve their packaging and invest in something higher quality. However, when I brought it the attention of the customer care team they issued me a refund which was greatly appreciated.",
