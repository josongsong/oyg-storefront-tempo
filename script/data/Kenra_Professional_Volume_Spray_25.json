Spray is now like a forceful dry shampoo..hair gets blown everywhere...not where you wanted it placed. And it holds for a bit but not very long. I've tried to love it but it's impossible. This one is going back and I will try the Paul Mitchell Firm Style aerosol instead that someone recommended. Bring back the old #25!!",
