This cleanser makes my skin feel SO refreshed! I actually look forward to washing my face now! It's easy to rinse off and doesn't leave a film or residue like other cleansers I've tried. I recommend this if you're new to skin care like me because it's easy to incorporate into your routine. I can obviously only speak for myself but I haven't noticed any breakouts or irritation, so I'd give it a shot if you have sensitive or dry skin!",

I had high hopes for this one given the reviews and bubble marketing for sensitibe skin types. It was HORRIBLE. Felt nice going on, until i rinse it off and looked at my face in the mirror. I could see red splotches all over my face that were getting larger. I have NEVER had this kind of reaction to any face wash before. No clue what's in it was the problem, but I would stay far away if you have sensitive skin",

        "comments": "Bubble's new skincare product, introduced in their recent soft launch, is a refreshing addition to the beauty market. The product in question, the Bubble Dewy Glow Moisturizer, promises to revolutionize daily skincare routines with its unique formulation and impressive results. The packaging of the Dewy Glow Moisturizer is both stylish and practical. Housed in a sleek, pastel-colored jar, it features an airless pump design to maintain the product's freshness and potency. This thoughtful design also ensures hygiene and ease of use, making it a standout in terms of functionality. The moisturizer itself is lightweight with a silky texture that glides effortlessly onto the skin. It's formulated with a blend of hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and squalane, which are known for their hydrating and skin-brightening properties. Upon application, the Dewy Glow Moisturizer absorbs quickly, leaving the skin feeling incredibly soft and supple without any greasy residue. One of the most remarkable aspects of this product is its immediate effect. Right after the first use, the skin appears more radiant and plump. Over the course of a week, consistent use resulted in noticeable improvements in skin texture and hydration. Fine lines were visibly reduced, and the overall complexion had a healthy, dewy glow. The Dewy Glow Moisturizer is also fragrance-free, making it suitable for sensitive skin. Its gentle formula did not cause any irritation or breakouts, even on reactive skin types. Additionally, the inclusion of niacinamide helped to even out skin tone and reduce redness, further enhancing its appeal. Bubble's commitment to clean beauty is evident in the Dewy Glow Moisturizer. It is free from parabens, sulfates, and artificial dyes, aligning with the brand's ethos of providing safe and effective skincare solutions. Overall, the soft launch of the Dewy Glow Moisturizer by Bubble has been a success. It is a highly effective product that delivers on its promises, providing deep hydration and a luminous complexion. As it becomes more widely available, it is likely to become a staple in many skincare routines.",

        "comments": "I recently have been getting into bubble products and have loved them so far. I'm on the hunt for an affordable face wash for my dry, sensitive skin. I had high hopes for this one given the reviews and bubble marketing for sensitibe skin types. It was HORRIBLE. Felt nice going on, until i rinse it off and looked at my face in the mirror. I could see red splotches all over my face that were getting larger. I have NEVER had this kind of reaction to any face wash before. No clue what's in it was the problem, but I would stay far away if you have sensitive skin",
