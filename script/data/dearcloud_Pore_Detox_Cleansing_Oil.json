While this product does remove makeup, it unfortunately leaves behind a heavy, oily film that doesn't rinse off easily with water. Even after using my foaming cleanser, my skin still felt like it wasn't fully clean.\n\nI typically use oil cleansers that emulsify and rinse off with water, which makes the double cleanse much more effective. This one, however, is difficult to wash off and feels like it just sits on the skin. After a week of use, I noticed my pores feeling more clogged and congested, which is disappointing.\n\nThe packaging is super cute, and I really wanted to love this cleanser—but sadly, it didn't work for me. I'll be returning it and going back to my tried-and-true centella light cleansing oil from SKIN1004.",

        "comments": "I wanted to try this cleansing oil cause i thought it was really cute and wanted to compare it to others ive tried. Little did i know the cute packaging would be what i hate most. The pump is so small and the overall shape does not make it easy when trying to hold and use this in the shower. The oil itself is fine, it does take quite a few pumps because you dont get much out with each pump and it takes a while to rinse off. Over all not bad for the price but definitely not a top ranker amongst other oils out there.",

I don't necessarily love the oil, nor hate it but i also dont know if i would repurchase? If youre wearing a full face of makeuo expect to use at least 4-5 pumps in order for it to fully do its job. My biggest pet peeve about this oil is the fact that the lil heavily sticks to your hands and does not come off with water,, i always end uo having to follow up with hand soap. a lot of people complain about the smell but i personally love it, it does smell like oil but it has kind if like an earthy tone to it",
