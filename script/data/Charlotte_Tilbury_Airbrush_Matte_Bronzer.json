Though I've a medium complexion, I bought the Deep shade because it looks like it has a reddish tone to it (compared to the other shades, based on online swatches), which my natural tan has.  The coverage is buildable- I have a feeling this is going to take me all through summer, from the light to dark tanning.  I couldn't be happier.  For me, this is well worth the price. A++",

I just felt compelled to leave a review because i cannot get over how much i love this. Truly i cannot recommend it enough. Seems like it should last a while too and i noticed you can buy refills (hopefully ulta sells these soon :)",
