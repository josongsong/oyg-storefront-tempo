Usually for mascara, eyeliner, and brow makeup, I add a dual phase makeup remover to the wipe for more cleaning power. I use wipes to clean my face because I'm too busy and tired to do a face washing routine. \n\nWith these wipes, it's a packaging issue. I want to buy the MAC bulk wipes in the good package, but Ulta unfortunately doesn't carry those, not even just to ship.  So I would need to go to yet another store.",
