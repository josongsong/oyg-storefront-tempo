There is one shimmer, the second blue one, which isn't super visible as a shimmer. That's not the biggest deal, but color-wise, it's very similar to the one before it. It's definitely a price performer, though and a permanent part of my palette use/collection.",

I wasn't ever really impressed with elf shadows before, but this is nice. It basically blends itself, the shades are lovely, and this palette in particular is something I can definitely use up completely. No dud shades or useless shades I'm going to ignore. I'm a big matte lover and this is going to be really great for early mornings before work if I want to look polished, but I also just love how easy and nice it looks for any time. I'm tempted to try more of the shade options now, but honestly I might get a backup of this one. The formula is really nice.",

The biggest dissapointment was the differences in color payoff, for example the purple color on my pallette is nearly invisible without putting in a lot of effort, whilet the blues show up just fine. It's a bit on the chalkier side but works for what I need it for, which is casual washes of color for everyday wear.",

I don't always do  extra smokey eyes these days, but I can pump it up with this one. I'm 63, so wearing a lot if glittery stuff on my eyes ages me. I love this pallette because it has a good offering of mattes and I can add a touch of beautiful shimmer where needed. It looks like the packaging has changed? Mine comes in a beautiful, premium feeling black case and I like that. I better scoop up some more at the drug store if this packaging is discontinued. I guess it's ok cause I like the bite size shadows so if they have to change the packaging to keep the price point down I'll have to accept that, darn it.",
