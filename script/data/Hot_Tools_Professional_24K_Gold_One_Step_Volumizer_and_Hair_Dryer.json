Every time I'd use a blow dryer, my hair would get so frizzy and fuzzy, no matter what heat protector I used. I've tried multiple times using different brushes and I'd always end up with the same results. I also should mention that I have weak muscles and problems with my nerves so standing for 30-45 minutes to fail at a blow out is nothing but a waste of time. I've been hearing about the hot air brushes from Revlon and John Frieda for over a year and have been wanting one so bad! So this year, I decided to buy myself one for my birthday!\nSadly, my local Ulta was sold out of the Revlon One-Step Volumizer and obviously didn't carry the John Frieda Volume Shine. I didn't want to wait to order either so I started looking at the Bed Head Blow Out Freak. It's the same price as the one by Revlon and seemed pretty similar. However, I felt unsure so I asked for help. I'm so glad I did, I was lead to the hot air brushes and was enthusiastically recommended either the Revlon or this one. As I said, they were sold out of the former, so I decided to get the latter. It was about $15 more, which kind of set me off from it. But with the \"real talk\" the sales woman had with me, she had me sold.\nI LOVE this tool. I can easily and confidently create a smooth blow out with so pain or strain!",

        "comments": "I purchased this cautiously optimistic from the hundreds of reviews I read and online YouTube videos I watched.  I was hoping that this could be that magic tool to finally calm my wavy, frizzy hair.  This arrived today and here's my experience.  First my hair type is blonde, shoulder-length, frizzy and wavy and is colored every 8-12 weeks.  I used DreamCoat spray and Caviar blowout creme to help with the frizz and was hopeful this combination in addition to this styling dryer would give me the straight, frizz-free results so many others had.\nI sectioned my hair and after a couple of minutes I noticed how unbelievably hot this dryer gets.  This dryer is more of an oval shape than the circular shape I expected.  I had this set on the highest setting to get the straight results I wanted.  This dryer has hot air blowing fiercely all over the barrel.  My bathroom is small and doesn't have windows and I had to have the door open and a fan on in addition to the air conditioning it became that hot.  The hot air blew against my face when drying the sides of my hair and it was uncomfortable.  I stopped partway through just to be able to cool down.  Also, this dryer is huge, almost too big.  My hair is shoulder length and this dryer felt too large for my hair.  It was difficult to get to the roots of my hair because this dryer was that large.  It is also very uncomfortable to hold for long period of time. I noticed when I set it down after a few minutes to answer a text, my hand was numb from holding it and it was difficult to move my fingers to text my daughter back.  That feeling eventually went away.  As a result, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who has hand or wrist issues.  It was also difficult for me to dry the back of my hair because this dryer was so large and I had trouble due to its size getting close enough to the roots in the back of my head and after I finished I realized there were parts still not dry.  I still had to go over my hair with my straightener.",
