I tried all the brands... Nars, Dior, Lancome, Hourglass, you name it... they all had issues. Either they were drying, they did not match my skin or were too sheer to cover up my redness. I had been using IT full coverage foundations for years, but as I aged, I found it drying to my skin. Enter this IT Full Coverage Moisturizer with SPF. Finally! It works! It's a bit more sheer than I'm used to, but is buildable without being too much. It lasts all day, and does not dry my skin out. I'm so, so happy to have found it. Please don't ever stop making it!!",

I'm 39 YO with Oily skin and visible pores and always fighting those fine lines.  I'm exactly between their CC Fair and Light shades, so I have to blend the two colors together daily.  I saw  this release of the Fair/Light color so I was excited to try it. The Fair/Light shade has a definite PINK undertone, but it's definitely still workable for me.  I wore it today with no moisturizer and no primer (I always wear both) and it's holding up much better than the CC cream!  For me the product provided better coverage than the CC cream while using less of it.  It also dried down to a natural finish pretty quickly.  CC always leaves me with a tacky, luminous, almost wet looking finish before I powder it in order to apply the rest of my make, but I didn't have to even powder with this!  I'm extremely happy with how it looks on my skin, and amazed that I didn't have to use as many products either.  I highly recommend!",

        "comments": "The IT cosmetics CC cream was my foundation of choice for months, but recently I was on the lookout for something different and thought this would be a perfect alternative. Boy was I wrong. I've never had an adverse reaction to makeup before nor do I have sensitive skin so I was shocked to discover that this product broke me out horribly. My skin is now red, irritated, dry, itchy, and covered in both small bumps and cystic acne as a result of this foundation. I'm embarrassed to leave my dorm since my skin is constantly inflamed and in pain, and I can hardly stand to look at myself in the mirror. I'm horrified and appalled that this company would release a product like this, claiming it can help skin conditions such as acne, dryness, and redness when it actually exacerbates all of those issues. To say the least, I would suggest that you stay as far away from this foundation as possible.",
