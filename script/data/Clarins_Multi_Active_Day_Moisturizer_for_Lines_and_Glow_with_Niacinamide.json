It's not a nasty fragrance but it is very irritating to the eyes, but if you happen to get it near the corners of your mouth it will gross you out... it's inconvenient because other facial moisturizers for the same price aren't this much of a hassle. I like Clarins but they need to tone down the fragrance in their facial products.",

Filled with natural extracts and antioxidants, it has made a day for my combo skin in late 30s. My skin looks renewed: plump and radiant. Overall, this is better than many other more expensive options and even produces better anti-aging effects on my skin, compared to Clarins' own anti-aging line. I have purchased 3rd jar, and will probably stick with it moving forward as it is very good for my sensitive skin and doesn't clog pores, irritate, or dry it. Love it!!!",

I have a dry skin and during cold weather it tends to get more dry but using this cream been skin saver it hydrants my skin with a just a little for all my face. It has a creamy like texture and a little goes along and get absorbed so quickly leaving my skin feeling so smooth and looking healthy. It has a subtle scent which I love and it is very refreshing when I apply it. Highly recommend. Gifted by Clarins",

I am a sucker for packing! \nThat is about where my love for these products end unfortunately. I did not notice any improvement in the hydration, texture, overall health of my skin while using these products. While I am open to trying skincare products with fragrance, I do prefer facial products to not have fragrance because fragrance in facial products can do more harm than good. There's literally no beneficial reason to add fragrance to facial products. This has fragrance pretty high up in the ingredients list and that is what ultimately made me not like these products on top of lack of results from the formula itself. \nThe fragrance in these products bothered my eye area and I did in fact get a pimple around my eye area which is not normal for me. \nIt's hard to say for sure that it was the fragrance or something else in the product that caused that to happen but for those reasons and the price I would definitely not recommend. There's less expensive products out there with and without fragrance that offer the same results.\nLack of results plus the irritation from what I assume is from the fragrance is enough for me to\nNot want to repurchase or recommend. \nMaybe if you have oily to normal skin and are not acne prone and you do not have any issues and like fragrance in your facial products you MIGHT like these products. I did receive sample sizes and sometimes it takes a longer time using a product to see any visible differences/improvements.",
