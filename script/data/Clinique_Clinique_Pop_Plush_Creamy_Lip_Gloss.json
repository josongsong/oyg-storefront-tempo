No sensitivity issues and I have allergies and if something touches my lips I'll know instantly bc my lips will swell. So nice to find products that work for sensitive skin! Also, I have pigmented lips, the oh snap from colour pop matches my inner lips perfectly and the outer edges are a neutral to warm brown. I bought the creme brulee and wasn't impressed with the color payoff but as a topper it's awesome! Shimmery not glittery so it adds dimension and plump to the lips. A warm brown so you can play with liners and other lipsticks to customize. The real pro is that I decided to wear it as is at night since it's pretty moisturizing and lo and behold, in the morning my pigmentation looked lighter! I don't know what caused it, but my lips hadn't been this light since I was a child! I've been using it as a lip mask at night. Anyhow, the strawberry pop is super cute too! A little too barbie pink for me at first since I have light warm neutral tan skin but calms down to a nice natural pink blushed lip color. Love these! I do miss the splash+hydration pop lip glosses formula. Please bring them back!",

No sensitivity issues and I have allergies and if something touches my lips I'll know instantly bc my lips will swell. So nice to find products that work for sensitive skin! Also, I have pigmented lips, the oh snap from colour pop matches my inner lips perfectly and the outer edges are a neutral to warm brown. I bought the creme brulee and wasn't impressed with the color payoff but as a topper it's awesome! Shimmery not glittery so it adds dimension and plump to the lips. A warm brown so you can play with liners and other lipsticks to customize. The real pro is that I decided to wear it as is at night since it's pretty moisturizing and lo and behold, in the morning my pigmentation looked lighter! I don't know what caused it, but my lips hadn't been this light since I was a child! I've been using it as a lip mask at night. Anyhow, the strawberry pop is super cute too! A little too barbie pink for me at first since I have light warm neutral tan skin but calms down to a nice natural pink blushed lip color. Love these! I do miss the splash+hydration pop lip glosses formula. Please bring them back!",

        "comments": "Once again, I was excited to try a new gloss/lip product, but this gloss (I got the rose color) contains large chunks of glitter. Nowhere in the description is a glitter or shimmer described, and it doesn't show up in the pictures at all. Unfortunately, I am not going to wear a gloss that is so glitter heavy. That's not what I thought I was getting and not what I wanted. Which is a shame, because otherwise the gloss seems lovely. Too bad …",
