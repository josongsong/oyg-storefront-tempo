Looks like second skin. \nIt does what it says and blurs texture and acne scars. \nColor match was perfect. Happy with the shade range. \nNo scent/fragrance. \nNo glow or pearl to the product, but still makes your skin healthy and natural looking. \nMakes my 43 year old skin look healthy, hydrated, and evened out. \n\nCons: Watery formula. You need to put this in your makeup bag upright, or else it will leak. Overall, I still like the packaging. You can't just throw it in your makeup bag, or it will get messy.\nSmall amout of product for the price. You can probably find something similar in a drugstore price range.",

The formula itself is very watery, but it glides on smoothly, looks very natural, the color match was perfect, it feels hydrating, and blends well. Overall, i think it is very nice. Can you find something similar for a lower cost? Probably. The con is the price, and the bottle needs to be placed upright to avoid leaking. I would still recommend. Not sure if its a repurchase though.",

        "comments": "I received this product for free from Influenster and Kylie Cosmetics in exchange for my honest review. \nThe Kylie Cosmetics Skin Tint is advertised to create an effortless, dewy glow. \nThis formula is lightweight and perfect for everyday wear. It offers just the right amount of coverage to even out your skin tone while still keeping your natural complexion. The liquid formula is very watery. You can keep it sheer for a \"no-makeup\" makeup look or layer it up for more coverage. I personally felt like I needed to layer it, one coat didn't give quite as much coverage as I like. I would do one coat for a \"no makeup\"look.\nIt's infused with skin-loving ingredients that is supposed to keep your face hydrated throughout the day. The finish is luminous, giving a smooth look. I have combination skin, and felt like it gave me a healthy glow, but I still set it with powder to help.\nI used the shade 3WN. When I swatched it on my hand, it looked pretty yellow. This shade was too warm for me, but once I blended it out on my face it was much less yellow and blended out more sheer. This shade was not my perfect match, but I could make it work. I used the Kylie Cosmetics skin tint brush to apply and blend into my skin. I love the brush! I think it is definitely worth getting the brush to use with this skin tint.\nI'm not sure if I would purchase this skin tint in the future, but if I did, I would want to swatch some shades in person. The thin liquid consistency seems like the product will last for a while and a little bit goes a long way!",
