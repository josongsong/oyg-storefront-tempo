But noticed after less than few hours it felt very dry, like I needed to reapply.  This often happens in my experience without some type of base layer for lipstick or lipgloss (love Urban decay Ozone stick as lip base!!), so not a deal breaker on this gloss.  Next time I'll use Ozone first.  Again, love the shade and emolliency.  Glad I got it on sale.",

        "comments": "I have been addicted to lip products for 30 years!  I needlessly buy every lip balm I can find just looking for the perfect combination of what my perfect preferences are (& i'm picky!):\n\n- hate applicaters, only like glide-on (like Chapstick or lipsmacker style)\n- I hate the over-stickiness of many glosses that make my hair sticks to my lips every time the wind blows! NO! NO! NO! \n- has to be mildy & naturally tinted, in colors that accentuate lips—NOT  overdramatize or are harsh colors.  The idea is to accentuate/beautify our lips, not to scare the 'love in our life' away or make our children refuse our kisses!!\n- not over-priced; < $15 for a basic lip balm\n\nI loved Dior addict lip shimmer, wore it for years, but after having children, the $25+ pricetag was just too much!\n\nThis Kylie tinted butter balm fit all my criteria, and I love the color like crazy—#338.  I like the sound it makes when you roll it up so you know that product is advancing with every click. I love the look and feel of the dispenser it's in, the price is right it goes on easily and smoothly and the color pretty much looks like you would expect it to when you apply it on your lips.\nIt lasts as long as you're not eating a full meal, and the size is perfect because it even fits in your jeans pocket nicely!  The only negative thing about it, which is not a dealbreaker for me. It's just something I wish would get changed in future iterations is the fact that the bomb does not retract back into the dispenser after use.  I'd also like to see more colors, but all in all this is a must have butter balm!!!!",

I have dry lips and a bit of a sensory issue with my lips meaning i CANNOT do matte, and may have a hard time with lipstick but this product makes it feel like im just applying a chapstick, it goes on incredibly smooth, is very moisturizing, and is not sticky\n\nThe only downside is you may need to reapply on occasion as it can dry out on its own making you lose your shine (without the feeling of dry skin) and the pigment can fade with normal activity. But with this kind of product I wasnt suprised since it wasnt really a lipstick and just a balm.\n\nOtherwise, I love it for a casual night out to dinner, anything formal id recommend a normal lipstick just because of the longevity. The lip is a vital part of a face of make up and you want it to last",
