Calling this 'micellar water' is misleading because it has the texture and consistency of a lotion or moisturizer; not even my daily face wash is this thick. This cannot be applied with a cotton round and can't  (or shouldn't be) left on your face without rinsing. This may be more similar to a balm to remove make up",

The packaging said to follow up with your 3 step skin routine.\n\nI usually wear a medium amount of make up.￼ ( Foundation to balance skin tone￼, blush, bronzer, eyeshadow, regular mascara, no eyeliner was worn at that time and my lipstick had already worn off)\n\nI would purchase again at similar price but I must admit that my holy grail is their take the day off cleansing balm!!!

I don't even wear heavy makeup; no liquid foundation, eyeliner, or waterproof mascara (I wear non-waterproof). It couldn't even remove my powder, much less anything else. Clinique should be ashamed of itself. I don't know how anyone at that company could possibly use this product and actually think it works. It you go ahead and try it for yourself, just be sure to use a cotton ball with some toner afterwards, and you'll see just how much makeup is still left on your face. At least Ulta has a great return policy.",

Since I have dry skin I purchased the purple one (which is for combo/dry skin).  To use it place a small amount (size of a quarter) in your palm and rub between hands.  Apply to your dry face and gently swirl all over.  Then either rinse off or use a tissue.  It works well to remove makeup and leaves your face soft.  However, I do wear a lot of makeup (primer, foundation, blush, bronzer, eye shadow, eye liner, mascara) and it did not remove my mascara.  I still had to use the (purple) Take the Day Off to get both the mascara and eye liner completely removed.  I also found that the Clarifying Lotion (#2) picked up much more makeup on the cotton pad then it does when I used the wipes to remove my makeup.  Although I like the product the wipes work much better at removing all your makeup.",

        "comments": "Since the eye makeup remover lotion was reformulated a very long time ago, I stopped being able to use it.The new ( early 2000's)version burned my eyes, so did Cetaphil cleanser, so you understand how sensitive I am! At that time, I had been using the Comforting Cream Cleanser to take off my face makeup. I then realized that it also made an amazing eye makeup remover, even better than the lotion specifically for eyes, and Cetaphil, because it lifted off waterproof mascara and everything else when just massaged into the eyes and then removed with a wet cotton ball, and the face was tissued off and then gone over with the Mild Clarifying Lotion (only one that was alcohol free and tolerated by my skin, and also discontinued for quite awhile!!). So when I saw this released, I was sure that it was finally the replacement for the long gone Comforting Cream Cleanser. I bought it immediately!  Even in the extra mild version, it burned my eyes and didn't remove makeup nearly as well as my old favorite!  I know that I am unusually sensitive, but there must be products on the market, especially by Clinique, which was my mother's go to brand, and I was introduced to it when there were virtually no other fragrance free products on the market! News of a bonus week was like a holiday for me! Today there are many FF and \"clean\" products available across all price categories. However, I still have not been able to find a cream cleanser that removes all makeup without causing irritation or a greasy residue in my eyes (Take the Day Off Balm, I am talking to you!). If anyone knows of any dupes for the Cleanser or Mild Clarifying Lotion, Clinique reps or fellow consumers, the info would be greatly appreciated.",
