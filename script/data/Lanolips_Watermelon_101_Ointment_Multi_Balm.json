After the first use, I still had some left on when I woke up! It blew my mind. Lanolips multi-balm has a thick texture that goes on easily. It looks gorgeous on, and has a very nice shine. Overall very happy to have tried this brand! Highly recommend!",

In less than a week my lips have become more moisturized, and stayed moisturized, than this entire year. It is COMPLETELY worth the price if you have chronic dry lips like me!",

It performs like the 101 ointment balms, but there is barely any watermelon scent/flavor. The scent that is there too isn't the greatest. It's a bit like plastic watermelon. I hope Lano redoes the formula so people can really enjoy it.",
