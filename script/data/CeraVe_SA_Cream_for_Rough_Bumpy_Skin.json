My bumps are barely visible and it feels amazing on my skin. I use this 1-2x every week. \nHowever, I do not recommend it for the face. I figured this was best for body use, but I wanted to see if it would help with bumps on my face, too. It just burned really bad and caused a rosacea flair-up. I didn't use it again on my face after that. \nI would definitely recommend it for those who struggle with KP or body acne, but beware if you want to use it for the face.",

I PURGED for the first few weeks. The week I nearly switched it out was when I started to see my acne clear. I started noticing a gradual glass skin appearance! I have been using it since. \n\nJust some lifestyle changes along the way too…\nHere's some of my personal skin care routine changes that helped with my facial acne:\n- Stress Management/ Getting full 8 hours of sleep\n- Drinking lots of water\n- Elta MD acne prone sunscreen during the day\n- Cerave cream to foam cleanser\n- Paula's Choice BHA exfoliant at night\n- Cerave SA cream at night\n- Organic, Cold pressed Castor oil for my brows and lashes \n\nI am not sponsored in any way lol just a sista helping sistas out! Hope this works with some of yall! Give Cerave a chance and at least a month to work. If it doesn't work- I hope your next skin care regimen will. I know it can be frustrating!! Good luck < 3",

Having now tried and used other SA products and ALL of the CeraVe line, I can confidently say that the CeraVe products are the top of the line -- with what they include and what they DON'T include! They are the only truly unscented, non-irritating line I've ever found, and I appreciate that I can FEEL a difference between the products -- the SA Cleanser vs. the Hydrating Cleanser, for example. It SHOULD feel different, by definition of included ingredients!! My skin looks and feels great, and at 48 years old that's saying a lot, apparently.",

I tried it again think my skin would adjust, and again and again. My skin is stinging. Do not recommend at all. I wouldn't trust all the reviews as people are payed to post them.",
