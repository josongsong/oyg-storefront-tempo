I can even create a subtle eyeshadow look from this product which is perfect for my conservative workplace. I read other reviews and to be honest, my product does not smell bad at all. It was very neutral smelling.  It's the favorite thing I've purchased in a long time. Very brown girl friendly.",

        "comments": "This is a great all in one blush and bronzer that shows up so well on my deep medium skin. I can adapt the look by swiping more from either the top or bottom. Usually other blushes or bronzers disappear on me after a few hours. I feel like my face eats make-up away BUT This product lasted all day. It's a perfect all in one product. I can even create a subtle eyeshadow look from this product which is perfect for my conservative workplace. I read other reviews and to be honest, my product does not smell bad at all. It was very neutral smelling.  It's the favorite thing I've purchased in a long time. Very brown girl friendly.",

        "comments": "I bought this with the intention of using it for travel since it promised to be multi-purpose. The good: the pigment! I am a light-medium, warm-undertoned Asian whose cheeks just eat blush--I apply it, it gets sucked into another dimension. Just like the Huesticks, this shows up and stays around all day. I can use each color separately or swirl it together, however, it seemed to irritate me a bit when I used it as a shadow (I have extremely sensitive eyes, though). The bad: the size (for what I wanted). The compact is huge. I should've made a note of the diameter, but it was probably close to 4&quot; across? Not the most convenient size for sticking in my purse or for traveling. Again, that's a personal preference, but the powder is also very soft so don't swirl your brush around b/c you will be cleaning the aftermath for quite some time. Tap gently and keep this one at home--it would make me nervous to travel with this given how loose the powder is pressed into the compact. In the end, I prefer the ease and portability of the Huesticks over this powder, so I ended up returning it.",
