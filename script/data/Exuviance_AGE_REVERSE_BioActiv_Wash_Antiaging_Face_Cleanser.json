The first day i washed i did notice a burn and thought maybe itll go alway and my skin will adjust. Nope at first it was nice and glowy and my skin started to look like i had burned it with red blotches. I did try again and did the same thing and even worse. Maybe im just allergic to something in it. Idk but its too pricey to be doing all of that.",

I used it for 5 days and woke up on the 6th. day with my face as red as a bad sunburn, swollen, itchy, and very dry.  I used it again that evening, not knowing what might have caused the bad reaction.  Then I remembered that this was the only new product I had with me.  Needless to say, I stopped using it.  It took another week for the swelling and redness to go away; I still have some patches of dryness.   I have other Exuviance products and have never had a problem, and, although I do not have sensitive skin, I guess there is something in this product that I must have had an allergic reaction to.",
