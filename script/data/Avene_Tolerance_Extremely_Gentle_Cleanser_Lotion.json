I'm very fair with some freckles and a tendency towards irritation. I use the avene cleanser lotion as step #2 of a two-step cleanse, with DHC oil as step #1. As I wear sunscreen every day and make-up often, I don't think I could use it alone. But the two are so gentle and yet effective together. They've been my face cleansers for roughly 3 years now, and while my skin is by no means perfect (and likely never will be) its not enraged and uncomfortable either.",

It got to the point that it looked like i had hives all over my face from how irritated my skin got after cleansing with my usual daily cleanser. I switched out to the sensitive cleansers from cetaphil to cerave and neither worked even vanicream that is said to be for extremely sensitive skin burned. Then i was recommended this one and it really is the only thing that helped my skin T_T It is light enough to not irritate my face but also leaves it quite soft after using i would definitely recommend. Now i just need to find a good moisturizer... I have combination skin btw but now its leaning more to dry",

        "comments": "I have been using this cleanser for 2-3 years, but as the SECOND step in a 2-step cleansing routine. It wouldn't be enough to take off makeup and sunscreen. I start with DHC deep cleansing oil (rubbed on a dry face, as per the instructions) and then after I rinse that off in the shower I use the Avene extremely gentle cleaner as the second cleanse. I also use it in the mornings when I wake up, as many dermatologists recommend that those with sensitive skin only splash their face with water in the morning or use something as profoundly gentle as this cleanser is. I find it very useful and imagine I'll continue to use it indefinitely. Again, it's not appropriate after an entire day out and about with sunscreen and/or make up on.",

All the big name gentle cleansers have been stripping enough and not replenishing enough to compete.\n\nI use it as my only cleanser with light to no makeup, and as a second cleanse after an oil-based cleanser if I wear foundation.

I dampen my face before using it, and I do use a damp cloth to gently wipe off what remains after washing my face. My skin is clean *and* moisturized after using, which is awesome, and I haven't needed as much other products afterward to restore and protect my skin barrier like I would with other face washes that make my skin tight, dry, flaky, and itchy after using them. I have very sensitive and reactive skin, it dries out very easily. This wash is lovely. It does not claim to be a makeup remover, so I wouldn't expect it to remove heavy eye makeup or foundation very easily. But I almost never wear make up on my skin, and I use an eye makeup remover, specifically, for that. Also, this product is fragrance free which is essential for sensitive and reactive skin. I almost sent it back after the first use, I'm glad I figured out to apply to a damp face, because I really love it.",

        "comments": "I have sensitive, dry skin. Most days I wear an  SPF lotion with no makeup. Some days I wear just foundation, powder, mascara and brow.  \n\nI was excited about trying a sample of Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser.  I know about the products and their spring water.  \n\nThe bottle of the sample I tried was very small. The cleanser itself has a milky serum texture with a pleasant scent.  This wipe-off cleanser is just as gentle as claimed.  Kept my skin clam with no burning or stinging irritation.  I found there was still residual makeup left unless I used the product twice.  I also tried applying in the shower then rinsing off; this method also required two applications to get the (not very much) eye makeup off.  If I used only one application, I had to follow up with a second product to remove eye makeup.  \n\nWhile I like the idea of Avene's cleanser, a product that requires a second step does me no favors.  I'm looking for things that make my life less complicated, not adding more tasks.  I'm left feeling that this isn't an everyday cleanser, only for the days my face is free of makeup or when I happen to be in a stretch of sensitivity.   It's great despite it's limitations, but not for me.",
