I couldnt keep it on more than a couple hours and by the time i removed it my eyelid was puffy and the oil glands on my waterline were clogged. I also tried it over another eyeshadow on my arm and it doesnt layer over other products nicely it just gets patchy and removes the product underneath. Its pretty but not worth the stye i got from it",

I love how long lasting the formula is and it doesn't flake off or smudge...even on my hooded, watery eyes. \n\nThe only FYI I have is that the shade \"glaze\" dries almost completely yellow/gold.  It is pictured as a lot more white when it dries down.  However, it is a beautiful yellow/gold. I just don't want someone to be disappointed because the online photo is a little different. I am working towards owning all the shades available in this collection.",

        "comments": "I don't have sensitive skin. This burned really bad about 5 minutes after drying down. It burned on my lids and on my undereyes. I went to remove it, and it would not come off. Typically, micellar water works really well for me, and the makeup is off after a couple of gentle swipes with a reusable bamboo \"cotton\" pad. This stuff would not budge, so I had to get rough with it.\n\nIt hurt SO BAD when I was removing it- it felt like sand or tiny shards of glass. Terrible experience. And I see now that I'm not the only one. The same exact thing happened to me when I used the Ulta Solar Flare Gel Chrome eyeshadow. \n\nI checked, compared the ingredients for both, and I found they both have a few of the same ones that I am almost positive I've never had on my eyes before. I checked all of my eyeshadows and they are not present in the ingredients lists. I am very familiar and experienced with skincare ingredients, and the few identifiable ones I saw in both of the products are also in my skincare products, and they do not cause a reaction on my skin.\n\nI narrowed it down to the following ingredients that are new for me:\n\nAluminum\nAluminum hydroxide\nAluminum calcium sodium silicate\n\nI am of course not saying that others who had a bad reaction have an intolerance to these ingredients, I'm just sharing what I know about my own experience.  Of course it may be a case of certain ingredients combined that caused the reaction I had, but I'm doing all I can! I will be trying to avoid those ingredients from now on. \n\nI used shade Bliss. It was absolutely gorgeous, I'll give it that. I'm bummed because these look amazing and I was so excited to get them.",

        "comments": "I really wanted to love these shimmery eyeshadows. The swatched colors online look glorious. I bought three and applied as a test as soon as I reached home. Two on upoer eyelid, the green was a liner under each eye. \n\nApplication was not smooth. Both on the eyelids streaked, requiring multiple swipes of the doe foot applicator. Fuzz came off one applicator and had to be picked off several times. The green as a liner was streaky but only had to be touched up once. \n\nWhen the eyeshadows were finally smooth swipes across my eyelids, I noticed that the product didnt want to stay in the crease and bunched up, requiring me to smooth it upward with a fingertip. This meant I now had to apply it there. I thought that meant that was probably the best place; application there was smoother. \n\nThinking all was well, I started about my afternoon then noticed my eyelids were burning. I hoped that sensation would calm down; it didnt. When I reached a mirror, I discovered much of the shadow along the brow line had flaked.  The product on the eyelids looked great but was now stinging.\n\nUpon removing the product, I discovered both eyelids were red and sensitive. I washed then applied a serum, but it was several minutes hefore my skin stopped hurting. \n\nI cannot recommend this product at all. It's a wonderful idea: a glimmering and iridescent ombre. However, those with sensitive skin should avoid it. Stick with the colourpop pan shadows; I don't react to those, and they wear all day without streaking or flaking.",

        "comments": "I tried all the colors, but the vest two are Morpho (blue) and Supernova (purple). The colors are rich and make amazing eye liner. Morpho actually looks more purple-y in person than it does online, and i love it. Bliss stays pink rather than color shifting. Same with See U Later - it stays a minty green color. Decode ans Glaze have aomw color shifting, but they mostly stay as their primary color (bronze for Decode, gold for Glaze). These shadows dry FAST, so there is very litte time to work with them. Know how and where you are going to apply the color beforehand. The doe foot applicator works better than a shadow brush for applying. If you want to use as a liner, use your liner brush to get product off the applicator. Once dried, these shadows stick to your lids like crazy, even without using a primer and through sweating. It took a good bi-phase makeup remover and some scrubbing to loosen the shadow for removal, then followed up with a cleansing balm. Regular face wash or plain soap and water barely make a dent in removing these shadows. Again, this is without using any kind of primer and after a full day of wear. For any liner brush you might have used, make sure you clean it as soon as you can so this shadow doesn't dry on the bristles. \n\nOverall, I'm prett happy with these shadows. The color shift isn't as intense as the pics shows, but the colors are still beautiful. The staying power is amazing. These would be great for any event or outing where you want your shadow to last all day - even on oily lids or after breaking a sweat - so you don't have to carry a makeup bag around with you for touch-ups. They'd also be good for face painting or cosplay.",

        "comments": "I don't have sensitive skin. This burned really bad about 5 minutes after drying down. It burned on my lids and on my undereyes. I went to remove it, and it would not come off. Typically, micellar water works really well for me, and the makeup is off after a couple of gentle swipes with a reusable bamboo \"cotton\" pad. This stuff would not budge, so I had to get rough with it.\n\nIt hurt SO BAD when I was removing it- it felt like sand or tiny shards of glass. Terrible experience. And I see now that I'm not the only one. The same exact thing happened to me when I used the Ulta Solar Flare Gel Chrome eyeshadow. \n\nI checked, compared the ingredients for both, and I found they both have a few of the same ones that I am almost positive I've never had on my eyes before. I checked all of my eyeshadows and they are not present in the ingredients lists. I am very familiar and experienced with skincare ingredients, and the few identifiable ones I saw in both of the products are also in my skincare products, and they do not cause a reaction on my skin.\n\nI narrowed it down to the following ingredients that are new for me:\n\nAluminum\nAluminum hydroxide\nAluminum calcium sodium silicate\n\nI am of course not saying that others who had a bad reaction have an intolerance to these ingredients, I'm just sharing what I know about my own experience.  Of course it may be a case of certain ingredients combined that caused the reaction I had, but I'm doing all I can! I will be trying to avoid those ingredients from now on. \n\nI used shade Bliss. It was absolutely gorgeous, I'll give it that. I'm bummed because these look amazing and I was so excited to get them.",
