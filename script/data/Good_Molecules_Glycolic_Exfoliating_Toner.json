Let it dry and put my regular deodorant on. Its so good for the summertime too. Being outside or in the water all day your deo tends to wear off. Now if it does im not insecure about it because i never stink. I just use deodorant for the antiperspirant factor to stay dry. Definitely love this stuff, just for different reasons lol",

Will never understand how some of y'all keep using a product that makes your face burn. If it burns that's not good! Doesn't mean the product is bad, it just wasn't right for your skin. Also, I feel like I should mention it, but avoid using it on your legs after shaving, save that for a non-shaving day.\n\nMy face prefers gentler formulations but I'm still in love and this is a great way to help prevent ingrown hairs, body acne, and foliculitus bumps. My skin is always so soft after using this and I use it about 1-3 times a week at most and I've noticed a marked decrease in issues with body acne, bumps, and ingrown hairs since I started using this.",

I tried several times with it by itself to be sure and every time the burning was too intense. I can handle occasional use of The Ordinary's peel (the red one), it burns but not nearly as intensely as this. I'm sure it's a good product, but it was too painful for me. I only used about 5 drops for my whole face so I went lightly and it was still too much. It burned more than any product has in recent memory.",
