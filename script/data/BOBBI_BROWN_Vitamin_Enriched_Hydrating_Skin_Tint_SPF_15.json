I should've walked around and then rechecked it because it separates and is cakey on some areas of my face. I've made sure my face was clean/dry/smooth (I've done both laser, hair removal and electrolysis). I tried applying with a sponge, my fingers and with a brush. It always turned out terribly. The liquid is quite thin and leaks immediately when you open the top. So if you are not careful it will spill. I didn't even make it halfway through before giving up and throwing it away. What a waste of money.",

I was gifted this New Vitamin Enriched Skin Tint complimentary from Bobbi Brown and I am so happy because it matches my skin tone perfectly! 🖤\n\nThis tint is amazing on my super dry skin! It's packed with Vitamins B, C, D and E. It contains Cactus Flower, SPF 15 and Pigment-Flex Technology, which helps shades melt seamlessly into skin, it gives sheer coverage that adapts to a range of skin tones. I was shocked how well this blended into my skin! The color match was perfect and there was no fading, creasing or settling. 🖤\n\nThis Bobbi Brown skin tint is sweat and humidity resistant and gives me 12 hour moisture and true wear. It contain hyaluronic acid to help with moisture and Shea butter to soften and condition. I'm so happy that I have finally found a skin tint that works for my skin! Usually most tints aren't a color match and end up settling into my fine lines and large pores. Not this Bobbi Brown tint though! I am definitely loving how my skin looks with this tint and am all for trying more from Bobbi Brown! 🖤",

        "comments": "Do not be fooled by the sales staff!  I used BB Oil Free Tinted Moisturizer in Extra Light tint for decades.  The new owners discontinued it and they expect you to love this. First, if you have the slightest bit of oil in your skin, expect to be shiny within minutes of wearing this.  Also, the colors are now terrible.  I have fair skin with cool undertones—that doesn't exist anymore in the right shade of fair.  It's also thick—the consistency is more mashed avocado than creamy light mayo. Very difficult to spread evenly with your fingers (as suggested) because it locks in where you first begin so you use more to get even coverage and then it looks caked on. Gone are the days of the barely there, light coverage that simply evens your skin tone. I used to get so many compliments on my skin, not anymore with this nasty junk. And don't get me started on the perfume smell. Puke. Super disappointing.  Buyer beware.",
