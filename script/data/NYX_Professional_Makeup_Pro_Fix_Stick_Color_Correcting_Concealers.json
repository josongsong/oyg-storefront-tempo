I have such a problem finding a product that doesn't weigh heavy under my eyes really settling into the very fine lines I have due to the creepy skin I have from a lot of fat loss in my face and aging of course.  I picked this up in peach first and it worked great for the slight bluish tone I had under my eyes.  I have very fair neutral combination skin with lines around my eyes and lips.  I lost my teeth due to a muscular degenerative disease so I've got a lot of lines around my lips but I can use a tiny detail brush with the fair shade & lightly touch up those areas and the lines disappear!  These have been my new little secret and I'm so thankful!  Every woman is entitled to feel their very best & when they find those products that fit into their confidence booster \"Holy Grail\" kit that makes them feel their best self that's when you know you're making a product that is magic!",

        "comments": "For reference I tried the correctors apricot and brick red with the shade sienna.\n\nAt first I did NOT like these products! I used the smash box primer and it felt like these concealers were not blending at ALL! Just stirring around on my face and it looked CRAZY (I didn't upload a picture because it looked fine on camera but crazy in person) so I tried it again lol\n\nI was going for a makeup no makeup \"clean girl\" look as you can see in the pictures and I liked it better! I used the milk hydrogrip primer but it was still…ehh. It's not something I would reach for.\n\nIt was hard to blend with a brush. So I guess overall, use a hydrating non-silicone based primer (so none of those pore blurring primers) and use a hydrating spray to mix it. I can't tell you how long it lasts because I haven't worn it for too long but if I do wear it again, I will update this review.\n\nApricot — it's said it's too correct hyperpigmentation and I believe it to be accurate. It covered my acne scars perfectly. But I must say it doesn't look bad as a normal shade either. I feel like it doubles as a corrector and a regular concealer.\n\nBrick red — it's for discoloration but I feel like this is TOO red for my neutral undertones and skin tone. It made the sienna concealer look red. This may be better suited for deeper/darker skin tones and those with more warm undertones.\n\nSienna — I love to use concealers as my foundation so to speak and this shade match is a perfect highlighting concealer, not an all over concealer for me. This is what made it ehh and made me realize it depends what primer you use because with the milk hydrogrip it was HARD to blend this out. You could slightly see the tribal marks in person 😭 but it isn't a bad concealer however I do not have time to figure which primer works best for this hence why I gave it a 3.",
