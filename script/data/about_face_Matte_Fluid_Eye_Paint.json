        "comments": "Heads up: Long review, but it's justified.    So I was initially hesitant to try this brand in general as most celebrity brands are a bit inconsistent in terms of quality. But after a long while of waiting and coming into Pride month, I really wanted to immerse myself in more LGBTQ+ beauty brands and realizing that I still hadn't tried About-Face, I ordered one of the eye paints to give it a go.    Needless to say, this is quite possibly my favorite liquid shadow formula EVER. Simple packaging, easy to apply and doesn't move once she sets. The first shade that I tried was Freaked and while the first layer might look light, it's beyond buildable. The color becomes more and more prominent and for a lavender that's almost muted, the pigment was nuts.    Realizing that I'd struck gold, I immediately ran onto this website and bought more. I was curious to try something more bold, but versatile to different looks. I decided to go with Taxi Driver and Art of Darkness; two ends of the spectrum that could be polarizing and that sounded divine as a makeup lover.   Taxi Driver is a true mango shade. The shots that they use on the website are a tad misleading in terms of how dark the actual shade is, but that's not to discount how absolutely stunning it is. I could imagine this would look beautiful on its own (and I do plan to do that as well), but adding a shimmer on top of this is just excellent.   And for Art of Darkness, this is the most sickening black liquid shadow I've interacted with that wasn't just me playing with eyeliner. It can make a gorgeous, dark look with vampy, gothic vibes or you can create an cat-eye sharp enough to cut diamonds.    Also buy the liner brush that's on here too. I need to review that also, but it works wonderfully to create that perfect cat eye.   The one downside that I see to this is it's accessibility in terms of what type of MUA will gravitate toward this type of product. You really need to work quick as it dries within seconds, so someone who's a little less experienced or new to makeup might have a hard time. I also had a little bit of an issue combining with any powder formulas. Which isn't really an issue if you're solely using About-Face products, but with how amazing this product is, I was hoping it would be a little more flexible in that regard.   To wrap it all up, if you're thinking of buying these and you love makeup, just do it. There's such a range of shades and the price is SO affordable that it makes sense to pick up a couple. I'm probably going to own the whole range within the next few months, so I can't wait to experience the full rainbow.   Thanks About-Face. Gave me more confidence that a true artist is behind the product.",

        "comments": "Let me first say I'm IN LOVE with the products. They stay, they're pigmented, they're easy to blend, a little goes a LONG way so you get your money's worth. I'm giving a side by side of before and after a rock concert where I was headbanging, drinking, sweating, yelling, singing, the works. I've got eye paint and a lip duo on and although you can't see much of the shadow, let me assure you, it didn't move. The corners of my lips are the only places that smudged but that comes from sweat and drinks - but it's still VERY MUCH there where I would've had to reapply other lip colors a few times during a concert.    My struggle comes from the customer service. I've had a couple orders now where I've been allowed to buy product(s) that are sold out but not listed as sold out on the website. One particular order I placed on 4/19, and after a week or not being updated about shipping reached out and was told it wasn't sent out because one of the products was sold out. No one reached out to me, no one said anything until I asked. The rep was sweet and offered to have me swap it for something else, but when it didn't ship after several more days, I reached out again and was told ANOTHER item wasn't available and I was being given a refund (mind you, it's been over a business week at this point and I would've been given this item had my shipment been corrected immediately). I still have not received this order and had originally placed it for the concert I was going to in these photos. What bothers me the most about all of this; the item I was given a refund for is currently listed as available despite me being told only a couple days ago that it was out of stock. I requested to be told when the shade was back in stock and have received no email leading me to believe it wasn't ever listed as unavailable or was always in stock to begin with.    The products are amazing and I love them especially for the price, but the run around with all of this is extremely frustrating. The answers I've been given have felt fluffy, I've had lack of information or clarification when asking for further information, and responses have very much been 'I'm sorry you're dealing with this but it'll be on the way soon' which - to be honest - makes it seem like they don't care much.",
