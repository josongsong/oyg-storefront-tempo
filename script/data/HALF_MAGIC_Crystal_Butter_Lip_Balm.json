It matches perfectly with the vibes of the product, which I really loved. Moving onto the lip balm, I was really surprised by the texture of the product. Visually it looks more like a lipstick, but just as the name suggests, it applies as easily as a lip balm. It was so smooth, it glided on my lips so easily. I was really impressed with the results. The appearance of the product on my lips was basically out of this world. It is a shiny lip girl's dream. The shimmer was 100% there but subtle enough that it didn't look like it was straight up glitter. but if that was the low-key preferred, then that was nothing that a few layers wouldn't fix. It was so easy to use and it had a great result and therefore I would definitely recommend this product to anybody that's looking for a shimmery and smooth lip balm!!",

        "comments": "I purchased this product from ulta about two weeks ago and was in love with the glitter finish! However, after this \"lip balm\" absorbs into the lips it is shockingly drying! I use so many popular drugstore to high end lip products, and have NEVER experienced anything like this, nor do I suffer from dry lips EVER. The formula almost leaves a powdery, dry, and tight feeling on the lips. I thought this perhaps was just me especially given the 12 hours hydration claims however after reading these Reviews i believe this is a formulation issue. Absolutely stunning product but absolutely needs reevaluations!",
