It leaves my skin looking clear and radiant and lasts about the same as any other foundation I have used. I can switch back and forth in summer and winter between two shades.  Over time, I have gone through at least 10 purchases of this foundation and will continue to use it. It does not settle into my pores or wrinkles. I do set it in a few spots with transluscent powder.",

The price for how much product you are getting is fabulous. The coverage is great, and for undereyes it's buildable. It blends great. And a little goes a long ways!\nFor cons, I am not sure if it was this or a different product, but it did make my undereye area burn really really badly. It didn't burn anywhere else I applied it, so it's possible it could have been something else. The only other con is that towards the end of the day, it starts to crease a bit. Although I noticed if you take a dry beauty blender and dab it a bit in the creasing areas, it smooths out nicely.\nFor reference, I have combination skin!",

I'm mexican so i have a olive undertone…basically yellow 🧍‍♀️….and i never rlly find a good shade ever i always have ti mix producs so YAY i found the right shade for now. Its very blendable. Its my spring shade for now until my summer shade. I wore it without powder and loved it. i use it for concealer not really foundation and it worked and had enough coverage. People talk about the smell but also are the ones talking about how lotions and skin care products with fragrence is bad (which is true) thats why i do not mind the little off smell. its honestly just a makeup smell. I reccomend 100%",

I used the color finder comparing it to my current IT foundation in medium which is my perfect winter color.  I got the color recommend and its several shades darker then my IT. The forumula is very thick but applies easily and blends well. The coverage was good but it left my skin dry looking and did accentuate fine lines. I will try again using less product. I dont think it worked under my eyes as well as using an actual concealer and thats fine.",

        "comments": "I had to switch foundations after realizing my Kat Von D foundation was actually EATING my skin, making my breakouts a lot worse, and causing really deep cystic pimples/staph infections (I'd get pimples, pop them PROPERLY then after applying foundation to cover them they'd turn into these giant flat scabby patches that would take over a month to heal and would scar a lot) I've got very dry skin with a slightly oily t-zone and the KVD foundation would \"crack\", settle into my pores, and cling horribly to my dry patches, so obviously I needed to switch foundations but couldn't afford to shell out $40+ for another high end foundation, so after reading a lot of reviews I gave this one a shot, and am seriously impressed. I'll give you my whole routine since some people seem to be having issues with it, I start off with NYX's honey dew me up primer (which is also GREAT as a night serum and has seriously helped my skin) and a little spritz of NYX's matte setting spray on my t-zone to help control oil, then buff a pump and a half into my face and neck with it cosmetic's airbrush foundation brush (it works nicely with a beauty blender too, but goes on sheerer this way), set it using the KVD powder foundation, generously spray with the NYX matte setting spray, then gently pat my whole face with a damp beauty blender (this step isn't necessary, but it helps merge the powder and cream together to keep it from looking cakes and gives me a really pretty flawless finish) I did my makeup at 9 am, and it's 7:30 now and my foundation still looks flawless, it covers blemishes and discoloration completely without needing any concealer, it's doesn't cling to my dry patches at all, doesn't settle into my pores, and holds up beautifully. It's doesn't crack or cake up like my KVD foundation would, and stays put if you have to blot it. My only complaints would be the VERY limited shade range, and it does oxidize a little so if you're between shades go with the lighter one.",

However, after less than an hour of wear, I noticed the foundation oxidized very badly and looked orange on my very fair skin (and I bought the lightest shade they make, 00A Porcelain). Also, the foundation had settled into my pores and made them look awful! I don't consider myself to be someone with very bad or noticeable pores at all, and I use a skincare regimen daily, but this foundation made it look like I was covered in blackheads! And that was with using the pore-minimizing Porefessional primer by Smashbox. Additionally, after less than an hour of wear, the foundation had worn off along my jaw/lower cheekbone and my redness was peeking through badly. To sum up, I liked how this foundation looked when I first applied it, but it just got worse and worse the longer I wore it (which was less than an hour!).",
