        "comments": "I've tried countless detanglers over the years, but Lolavi Hair Detangler truly stands out. From the very first use, I noticed how easily it glided through my hair, making knots and tangles disappear without any pulling or breakage.\n\nWhat I love most is that it leaves my hair shiny, smooth, and incredibly soft—without weighing it down at all. There's no greasy residue, just light, manageable hair that looks and feels healthy. The scent is lovely too—fresh but not overpowering.\n\nHonestly, it might be a little more expensive than some drugstore brands, but it's absolutely worth the extra few bucks. The quality speaks for itself, and a little goes a long way. If you're looking for a detangler that delivers salon-like results at home, this is it!\n\nHighly recommend!",

        "headline": "Review edit - Terrible on low-po hair and inflamed my scalp",
        "comments": "Came back to edit my initial review. I have very low porosity hair and for weeks I was thrilled to have great outcomes with this glossing detangler, then I started gradually seeing the improvements fade away. Worse, my scalp was constantly itching, and even when the itching began I tried to ignore any likely relationship between that and the detangler. Then came the kicker - thicker strands clumped together and began falling out like an effluvium event while I combed it out. Every single time I used this. And it started quickly regressing into the knotted dried out nightmare it was before this. Finally, I had to stop using it and note changes. After I finished rinsing hair in extremely hot water and combing without the product...the non stop itching stopped, and there were at last no thick strands falling out. The reason is that this product contains agents to coat the hair, and if hair is super lo-po as mine is, it will bind with that along w/the strands already thinning from my moderate AGA and aging (61 yrs) so trying to get a comb through that, even when not tugging, brings all the fused hair together and takes out as a single clump. And I learned that a few other ingredients are also irritating for people who have very sensitive skin and scalps.I had suffered from a particularly bad experience of stiff, lumpy, clumpy hair in using the product for 3 mos, and finally learned that this product not only didn't help me with that issue, because the heavy residue is incredibly hard to remove, it actually was worsening it, causing irritation of the scalp with increased hair shedding.",

        "comments": "I am stuck w/thinning non-porous hair that has looked and felt like dried up tumbleweed for years. My former crowning glory of thick hair got thin, shriveled up, refuses any products or moisture, and has gotten extremely impossible dealing w/ith these last 10 yrs. I'm now 61 and I dreaded using any kind of conditioner even though I strictly avoid proteins and silicone and finding products like that is incredibly tough. Enter Lola Vie. I went looking for a heat protectant that was free of these ingredients and went through tons of ingredient lists on labels. I kept seeing this Lola Vie thing and thought it was some miscellaneous \"nothing\" brand, and finally after going through all the other products, I looked at the product label. Okay, it appeared to be everything I'd been searching for, yet still I remained skeptical because EVERYTHING sits on top of this 4c, naturally kinky curly hair (caucasian) and always seem to create a worse rat's nest. Instead, it put some real MOISTURE into these dried out strands and the ends...oh. my. G-D. They looked like HAIR, not frizzy tumbleweed, an issue that I've always had, even before the thinning and the hair loss of that time of life. It makes it glossy, easy to detangle, am praying it still will work great once I get the courage up to flat iron it. It's absolutely the most useful hair stylist product I've ever tried. I also use the oil, which absorbs amazingly well while my collection of other pure oils like argan, baobab, and countless others NEVER produce such a result. Now the leavein perfector, that one I'd received as a free sample, really does not seem like it's making a difference, except to perhaps give a duller appearance to my hair. But the other 2 are wonderful.",

        "comments": "Came back to edit my initial review. I have very low porosity hair and for weeks I was thrilled to have great outcomes with this glossing detangler, then I started gradually seeing the improvements fade away. Worse, my scalp was constantly itching, and even when the itching began I tried to ignore any likely relationship between that and the detangler. Then came the kicker - thicker strands clumped together and began falling out like an effluvium event while I combed it out. Every single time I used this. And it started quickly regressing into the knotted dried out nightmare it was before this. Finally, I had to stop using it and note changes. After I finished rinsing hair in extremely hot water and combing without the product...the non stop itching stopped, and there were at last no thick strands falling out. The reason is that this product contains agents to coat the hair, and if hair is super lo-po as mine is, it will bind with that along w/the strands already thinning from my moderate AGA and aging (61 yrs) so trying to get a comb through that, even when not tugging, brings all the fused hair together and takes out as a single clump. And I learned that a few other ingredients are also irritating for people who have very sensitive skin and scalps.I had suffered from a particularly bad experience of stiff, lumpy, clumpy hair in using the product for 3 mos, and finally learned that this product not only didn't help me with that issue, because the heavy residue is incredibly hard to remove, it actually was worsening it, causing irritation of the scalp with increased hair shedding.",
