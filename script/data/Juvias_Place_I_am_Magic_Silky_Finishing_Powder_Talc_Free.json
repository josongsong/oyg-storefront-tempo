Literally blurs your face and makes it so your makeup doesnt crease. The pink shade is super flattering on my fair skin as it somehow still brightens my undereye considering im usually the lightest shades when it comes to anything. When you put setting spray on this powder it literally melts into your skin which i personally love. will be going back and getting a third one but in the shade \"coconut flakes\". Compared to all the drugstore and high end powders, this beats every single one.",
