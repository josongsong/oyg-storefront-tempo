Theirs nothing about this oil that justifies the price. The ELF lip oil feels, smells and performs just the same. My friend is a die hard for this. I used the elf and dior two different times while her eyes were close. She chose the elf as the dior. You can buy 4 lip oils from elf for the price of one dior. You're paying for the label. If you've made it this far in my review. Thanks.",

I was expecting a smooth, hydrating product, but instead, it just sits on top of my lips and doesn't do anything to actually help. It's like it's just a thin layer that doesn't absorb, and it makes my lips feel more dehydrated. Honestly, it's a huge disappointment, and I regret buying it.

While the initial hydrating effect lasts a few hours, the tint remains visible even after the balm wears off. Reapplication is necessary after eating or drinking, but the process feels more like a treat than a chore.",

        "comments": "I recently tried the Dior Lip Oil in Rosewood, hoping it would live up to the buzz. Unfortunately, it didn't quite hit the mark for me. Marketed for its nourishing cherry oil, which promises to shield lips from drying, I found myself needing to reapply it many times throughout the day—far from what I expected given the price point. The texture and finish were pleasant, but not uniquely superior. In fact, it reminded me a lot of another lip oil I've used, which costs half the price and performs similarly. Given the high expectations set by Dior's branding, this product felt like a letdown. For those considering this lip oil, I suggest exploring other options in the market that could offer better value for your money. There are plenty of effective lip care products out there that won't require frequent reapplication and come at a more reasonable price. Save your money and keep looking! *gifted by Christiandiorbeauty *",
