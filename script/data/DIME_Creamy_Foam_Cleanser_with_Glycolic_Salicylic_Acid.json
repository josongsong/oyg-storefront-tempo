  "summary": "SummaryHighlightsClean IngredientsCruelty FreeVeganSustainable PackagingGive BackCleanse and gently exfoliate your skin with DIME Creamy Foam Cleanser: Glycolic + Salicylic Acid. This clean, lightweight formula sinks deep into pores to eliminate excess oil, debris, and acne-causing bacteria. For all skin types, this cleanser is especially effective for oily or acne-prone skin.",
  "details": "DetailsBenefitsDissolves dead skin cells to keep pores cleanHelps accelerate skin cell turnoverKey IngredientsSalicylic Acid: Salicylic acid is a highly effective BHA (Beta Hydroxy Acid) that helps prevents pore clogging and assists in reducing swelling and redness. It is an effective treatment that helps clear blemishes quickly by penetrating pores and removing excess oil and bacteria.Glycolic Acid: Glycolic acid is a powerful AHA (Alpha Hydroxy Acid), a natural component derived from sugar cane, known to improve uneven skin tone. This acid is designed to exfoliate and cleanse clogged pores while refining the skin’s texture and reducing the appearance of blemishes and scarring.Formulated WithoutSulfates: DIME products never contain skin-irritating ingredients such as sulfates. Sulfate-free products are gentle on the skin and can help decrease the chances of an allergic reaction.Phthalates: Certain phthalates (like Dibutyl Phthalate, aka DBP, or DEHP, and DEP) appear on product labels, but most typically remain unlisted, hiding under the term “fragrance.” Since some phthalates have been linked to hormone disruption, DIME avoids them.Item 2616777How To UseDispense 2-3 pumps of cleanser into your hand.

My skin is sooo smooth and free of any and all small to large spots of acne. I was a bit anxious to try this cleanser thinking it would be too harsh for my sensitive skin. It's totally gentle enough to where there is no irritation. Gentle yet very cleansing, it gets it allll out. At first I found myself using more than 2-3 pumps. Now that I know, That's all you need. A little goes a long way. I'm not even half way done with my first bottle and I have already ordered another bottle, along with the TBT cream. Very thankful this cleanser is gentle enough yet powerful in the cleaning department for me. My favorite go to cleanser by Kiehls was discontinued and DIME was recommended by a friend in Toronto. DIME will be the only company I use for skincare for the foreseeable future. I have never had products blow me away upon first impressions like DIME. Bravo yall, bravo.",

        "comments": "I really love the actual product - the foam is nice and light and does not dry out my skin, but easily removes my makeup. However, the pump gets stuck in the \"down\" position every single time I use it. It's so annoying that it will definitely prevent me from purchasing this product again until the packaging is improved. Very unfortunate. Fumbling around with a wet face full running mascara in my eyes while trying to pump the bottle is just not how I like to end my day. Please send out an email/texy blast when the packaging is improved!",
