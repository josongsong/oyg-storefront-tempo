It rained but I wasn't stressed because I thought this hairspray would be great. I wore my hair wavy and sprayed it, and used a hood and umbrella. In less than an hour my hair was totally limp, all waves straightened out, and frizzy. To make it worse it was crunchy and stiff limp hair so couldn't brush it or even try to recreate any type of style. One of my worst hair days ever. This is going back so fast. Never again.",

Although I cannot even imagine my hair ever needing this sort of hold, as I prefer flexible, flowy hair, this spray is impressive nonetheless.  It smells amazing, like juicy apples, and it's possible to literally create rock-hard styles by layering this spray on itself a few times.  The hold lasts through harsh wind and even mild rain!  This is some very serious stuff if you want this kind of superhero hold!",

        "comments": "I received this product complimentary from Influenster to provide an honest review. The hair spray has a great smell. Something between a fresh scent and a floral scent. The hold is good, but does leave your hair feeling crunchy. I didn't notice any sticky feeling on my skin from my hair, but my hair was also up. My main complaint is how far away from your head you need to hold the can. The spray is forceful, but the stream coming out takes a while to widen out. So if you are spraying too close to your head you get a TON of hairspray in an area instead of that side of your head. And since it's so forceful, being that close to your head causes it to almost bounce off your head and get overspray to other areas, like your ears and forehead. So yes this product works, but there's a learning curve for where to hold the can. You need to be at least 2-3 feet away from your head in my opinion.",
