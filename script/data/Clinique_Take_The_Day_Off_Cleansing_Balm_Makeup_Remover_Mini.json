My skin has also become super sensitive all over, so I've had to stop using my regular products and find something gentler. I remembered using Clinique when I was younger and how gentle it was, so I looked through their products and found this. The balm helps with moisture, which I then kick up a little bit with the Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel. The best part is that when my scalp started to get dry (no hair the past couple months), I just applied this to my scalp and like I do to my face and I get a clean scalp that's ready for a moisturizer too. I know this is meant to take off make up and to follow up with the 3-step system, but this gets my skin so clean and fresh feeling that I use it as a face cleanser all on its own. There are lots of little things that come from treatment that are just a reminder that the cancer is there, like pain and sensitivity. I really like that I can depend on this to help me feel normal, at least when I wash my face.",

Now, I have both liquid and cream and neither removes non waterproof mascara or eyeliner. You'd have to rub your skin off to get it off and I really don't get all the positive reviews. Clinique needs to step up and either find the old ingredients used in their products that made them work or really go back to the drawing board!",
