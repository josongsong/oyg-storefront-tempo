Who doesn't love the darling vintage illustrations, quirky packaging, and cute names, but I have to say I'm disappointed with the Porefessional Primer.\nPros: 1. It makes your skin smooth and matte, 2. it's packaged nicely, and 3. it makes your makeup stay longer: it creates a barrier between your skin and your makeup.\nCons: 1. It smells gross, 2. it didn't make my pores appear any smaller (and I don't have abnormally small or large pores), 3. very pricey, especially when there are primers that work better at its intended purpose, 4. it felt thick on my skin, even in the recommended pea size amount, and 5. it's so little product for the price, my bottle came unopened but I swear only half of the container was full.\nSo in my experience, yes it works as a basic primer, but it didn't live up to the description of the product, and I'd much rather buy a drugstore primer that reduces the size of my pores, makes my skin matte, reduces redness, lasts longer, and doesn't feel quite so heavy or have an odor.",
