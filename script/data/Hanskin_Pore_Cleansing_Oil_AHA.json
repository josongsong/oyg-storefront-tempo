I think from it damaging my skin barrier. Ill go back to using my good molecules cleansing balm daily and just using this maybe once a week to deep clean. If your skin isnt as sensitive this would probably be a great product. It does clean the pores out so good. You can see the dirty and grossness come out on your hands. Just not the best for sensitive skin. But every week or 2 i think ill use it.",

It really breaks down all the grim, sunscreen, makeup and whatever else is on my skin so seamlessly all while leaving my face very much not dry. I've honestly replaced my regular cleanser with this (for the most part — I still use my regular cleanser but only when my face needs the extra cleaning) and it's been soooo great!! My skin feels way less dry and really clean!",

At first, I used it almost every day since it softened my cheeks and forehead well but realized it wasn't great at getting off mascara because it made my eyes cloudy from the oil. I know you're not supposed to use it on the eyes but I get so lazy that I can't help it! This product works well for low makeup days and does a fantastic job of removing any makeup and dead skin from my face. I followed the instructions and applied it dry and then washed with warm water to let it emulsify with the product. AHA has been super great to my skin and although I wouldn't use it on a daily basis, I've been very happy with the results. I definitely recommend this product to others with dry skin!",

When I finally looked at the ingredients, I noticed that mineral oil is the first few ingredients and this worries me. Not a fan of mineral oil when there's so many oils that can do the same but more beneficial in my opinion. If you're not picky like me, then give it a try.",
