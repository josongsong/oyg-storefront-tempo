Having Asian lashes has always made eye makeup hard for me, but these are such a game changer. They take 5 minutes to apply, and I was even able to put them on during my lunch break in the break room when I realized I had an event after. The best part? They look JUST like a fresh fill on my lash extensions, down to the length and curl and everything. The only critique I have is that a couple of lashes in the box weren't sticky and I had to throw them away. Also, they're def single use and not reusable. Overall, I recommend this for all my ABGs and I will be repurchasing these forever < 3",

I do not get them wet in the shower and that's probably why they've lasted so long. I just wash my face with a wash cloth when I get out so I can control how wet they get. 10/10 GET THEM!!",

Its not that bad of a reaction but im a little discouraged since ive been wanting wear lashes again without having an allergic reaction. But other than that theyre really good press on lashes, they arent as full as the lashes im used to wearing but they still look really nice on the eyes.

I usually only wear the full band lashes for special occasions — date nights, weddings, holiday parties, things like that. And even then, I'm not an expert. Just to give you an idea: I only learned a year or two ago that people actually apply lashes under their lash line! I had always applied them above, so that tells you my experience level 😅\n\nNow, let's talk about these Impress Falsies Self-Adhesive Eyelashes.\n\nHands down, what I love most is no glue involved. Seriously, finding the right glue, waiting for it to get tacky (but not too dry), and then dealing with the mess if it gets anywhere else — it's just chaos. But with these? They're already sticky! You literally just peel and apply. Chef's kiss. I want to kiss the hand of whoever invented these.\n\nThat said, when I was removing the lashes from the packaging, some came off super easily and others were a bit stuck, which made me nervous about accidentally tearing them. Thankfully, I didn't. The included tool is okay — it does the job, but honestly, I found it easier to just use my fingers for placement. With a little more practice, though, I feel like I'll get the hang of it and make the application look seamless.\n\nIf you look at my photos, you'll see they already look pretty invisible, but I can tell on one eye you can still slightly see where I placed them. I really think with a little more practice, I could get them to look flawless.\n\nI got the medium-long lashes, and for my smaller, hooded eyes, I found that two clusters on the outer corners were perfect. I tried adding a third cluster on one eye, but it felt like too much for me. Keeping it to just two gave me that wispy, cat-eye effect that I love. Plus, it really suits my eye shape!\n\nWhat I also love is how lightweight they feel. On the eye where I applied them just right, I honestly don't feel them at all — I don't see them, I don't feel them, nothing. On the other eye, where I didn't place them quite as well, I do feel them a little bit and can see them slightly, but that's on me. The better you apply them, the better they feel! 😍\n\nAnother thing: even when I'm not wearing makeup (like in the photos), these lashes make me feel alive and put together. As a busy mom who doesn't always have time to do a full face, these are game changers. I might just become an everyday lash girly because of them! 🤭\n\nAnd removal? So easy. Unlike full band lashes with glue, where taking them off at the end of the day feels like taking off your bra (you know the feeling!), these peel off easily with no mess.\n\nIn short: I love these lashes. They're quick, easy, and beginner-friendly, and they make me feel beautiful without the usual hassle. Highly recommend! If I can do it, anyone can hehe",

        "comments": "I was sent the imPRESS Falsies self-adhesive eyelashes in exchange for my review. I never wear false eyelashes so this was a new try for me. This product comes with a metal eyelash applicator that seems to be of pretty good quality. However when trying to pluck an eyelash from the tray, I found it tricky to hold because the clamps don't meet together well enough. Could be a slight defect with my product. Also these eyelashes are advertised to not need any glue so I applied directly under my natural eyelashes as directed. Perhaps this would be easier for someone more experienced in applying these but I struggled to put these on and make sure they stuck well under my eyes. Eventually I got them on and loved the look, even if just applying on the outer edge of my eyes. It adds a nice subtle touch to your look. Once finished, I moved on with my day working around the house. It happened to be a very windy day and while outside working in the yard, I felt one come loose and had to go back to a mirror to correct it. I don't trust that these eyelashes will stick very well as you go throughout your day and found that they come off way too easily for my trust issues. When removing them, they came off very easily as I expected. However, I would like them to stick a little better so they don't come off before I want them too. It seems like they will last for a few re-stickings though but the quality of the self-adhensive will lessen as you do this. As for my final thought, I'm on the fence about these. If you love false eyelashes, I would definitely give these a try. They are very easy to apply once you figure it out. However, if you're a newbie to falsies like me, I would probably just skip it and stick with mascara.",
