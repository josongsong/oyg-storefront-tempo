Living in South Florida, my skin will roast if I am outside for 15 minutes without any sun protection, so I very much like that my skin is shielded from both UVA and UVB rays with this product- resulting in preventing premature aging and sun damage. I really love the brand is incorporating sun friendly bio-retinoid in their formula. This is a genius idea as the retinoid is working to address the signs of aging, all while being in the sun. Frankly, I've never seen this kind of dermatological advancement before. The texture of my skin has improved, and now my skin looks brighter, smoother, and without brown spots/hyperpigmentation! I also like it is a moisturizer. My skin feels hydrated throughout the day, and I can actually skip a separate moisturizer when using this product. I have not noticed a white cast after application so it's a huge win for me ! It's great value for the price, considering the quality ingredients the product includes. The packaging is not only sleek and travel-friendly but also practical for everyday use. Skincare innovations/scientific discoveries continue to leave me in AWE, and I am HERE FOR IT !

It applies smoothly, feels lightweight, and gives a soft satin finish without the greasy residue that many sunscreens leave behind. I have very sensitive, combination skin, and had zero irritation or breakouts with this product.\n\nIt does have a light scent, so that's something to keep in mind if you're scent-sensitive. But overall, this is a high-quality product that lives up to Murad's great reputation. The packaging is sleek, the pump dispenses well, and while it's a bit of a splurge, I genuinely think it's worth the price. Five out of five from me—no notes.",

Rain or shine, at home, or at work, I incorporate sunscreen into my daily routine.  Sunscreen just isn't for sunny days, you need it everyday to prevent damage from harsh lights and UV rays.  \n\nMurad's Resurgence is a 3-in-1 product, and I love a product that has multiple benefits.  Resurgence is a moisturizer with the added benefits of 50 SPF and plant based bio-retinol.  This is a game changer.\n\nAs a moisturizer, it packs a punch and hits the mark.  Superior hydration that leaves the skin hydrated, nourished, and silky.\n\nBio-retinoid is perfect for individuals who are new to retinol, or who have sensitive skin.  It is gentle and its main purpose is to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  The huge benefit here is that you can use this in the morning, whereas with retinols, you should only use them at night.  A bio-renting I'd is very gentle.\n\nThe SPF 50 is another bonus. It provides protection from UVB and UVA damage to help protect the skin.\n\nYou apply the Resurgence in the morning, after cleansing and use of your favorite serum.  Unlike other sunscreens, this product will not leave that annoying white cast.\n\nResurgence is perfect for all skin types, in my opinion.  It is not drying or oily.  It is also perfect for men and women!\n\n***Bonus - I also use it as a hand moisturizer… your hands need the bio-retinoid and sunscreen too.\n\nI never give 5 stars because no product, in my opinion, is perfect, but this one surpassed all of my expectations.  It left my skin moisturized, protective, and it really improved the appearance of my fine lines!",

        "comments": "I received this Superactive Moisturizer SPF 50 (Wrinkle-Fighting) in exchange for my review. My opinion is my own based on my experience using the product. I liked that this didn't leave a white cast and seemed to disappear on my skin. It did feel like it left a residue and my skin looked a bit too shiny. When I tried to reapply layer, I got some pilling. I used it on my arm to test without reapplication and it left a residue that rubbed off as the day went on. I don't like how this felt on my skin and prefer something that absorbs a bit more. There's a light citrus fragrance. While it's nice that this has both a higher level of SPF than many facial moisturizers and contains active ingredients, I'm not sure how much of the wrinkle fighting actives are in this product. The data on the website is \"consumer perception\" and didn't include participants with Fitzpatrick type I skin. I prefer clinical tests when claims say things \"100% agree the product was non irritating\". Especially since the sample size was 35 people. This is on the pricier end for an SPF product but it does claim to have additional benefits. While this didn't feel heavy and it did provide some moisture, I'm more satisfied with my current 2 products over this multitasker. If you are someone who struggles to wear SPF, I think this might be worth trying. I haven't used it long enough to speak on any longer term, wrinkle reducing benefits.",
