Bar shampoos in particular were rough on my hair which was disappointing since I was trying to be more eco-conscious. This shampoo on the other hand makes my hair feel so soft! I love that it is gentle on my scalp and, it doesn't seem to have any artificial scents. It lathers well and also doesn't feel stripping on the skin.\n\nThe only supposed con is the plastic wrapper in an otherwise great eco-conscious product. I've used other bars that have fully compostable packaging, so it was a little disappointing but not a dealbreaker.\nIf this isn't a con for you, I would say there really is nothing negative I can say about this shampoo.",

I tested it at home and figured it would work fine for face and body but didn't expect a great hair day from it, but boy was I wrong. I double \"shampoo'd\" as per usual and I'm very impressed by how soft yet not weighed down my hair is, it also is much easier to detangle than normal. I have thick/dense yet dry hair so normally it's hard to get something that is moisturizing but still thoroughly cleans my hair and I am still in shock at how well this did. My skin is very happy with it too, again got a good clean but not stripping. I find myself reaching for it even at home over anything else. It did live up to my expectation of being efficient, but also far exceeded it. It's a new staple for me.",

After shampooing, my scalp doesn't feel clean, and my hair turns into an oily mess within 24 hours of washing my hair.  In comparison, when I use Briogeo's Cherry Mango Shampoo, I am able to go 2-3 days without my hair getting oily.  This bar just isn't meant for oily hair.",
