This is the worst breakout I have had in my life. I was hopeful due to the brand and it being made for sensitive/ red skin but it has wrecked mine pretty badly. Just a caution - again everyone is different!",

        "comments": "This product really surprised me.... out of the tube, it feels really light and watery, like it wouldn't do anything for you, but once you put it on your face, it immediately sinks in... you really do get that plumping feeling that other products say they do, but don't. I have extremely dry skin from using retin-a for the last couple years, and I normally moisturize with three products; a water gel, a regular moisturizer, and an oil to seal the moisture in.... I've been through so many high end moisturizers, and at the end of my day, I always feel a little dry. This product moisturizes like a dream.... I don't have to fallow up with anything else. It's very lightweight, does not leave the skin greasy, and does not sting my face like other hylouronic acid gels usually do to me. I will say that this item is pretty pricey, however, you really don't need a lot. My previous holy grail water gel cream was the Peter Thomas Roth cream cloud, however I had to use a lot more of that each time to apply. This is not like that. A pea sized amount will moisturize your whole face. I'm very impressed with this and until now didn't know a moisturizer like this existed. I think this product would be great for all skin types. It's lightweight for oily skin, but hydrates very well for dry skin. There is also not really a scent to this, so sensitive skin would like this as well. Definitely my new holy grail. Works excellent under makeup since it is water based. Really am enjoying this a lot more than I thought I would just based on the texture of the gel. I'm 34 years old, and do have dry sensitive acne prone skin, and this has not broke me out (I usually get breakouts immediately if it's a product that doesn't work for my skin) \nObviously everyone's skin is different, but I really think this is a great product, at least get a sample or try it in store. Really starting to love dermalogica products. I have their hydro blur primer, and multi active toner, both I absolutely love also.",

Water Gels are quite the rage and living in the Northeast where the wind hurts your face in the winter I was very excited to have a layer of defense. However, as hard as I want to like this product I just can't, and I have been using it for about a month now. Like with any new product, I did notice slight breakouts when I switched. However even after the normal 2 week period I am still noticing clogged pores and blemishes. The gel is also very clinical smelling, it's very potent. It reminds me of walking into an OB/GYN office for some reason, and the smell doesn't dissipate right away, neither does the greasy or wet appearance after putting it on your skin. I normally have to put it on my face and then do something else for about 15 minutes for the product to fully absorb into my skin before putting makeup on, or I notice my makeup running down my face in a few hours even with a primer on. Most importantly, this gel has increased the redness and blotch I was to my uneven skin tone. After a consistent 4 weeks of use I went back to my normal moisturizer because I couldn't continue to see a decline in my skins appearance After I had worked 6 years to clear acne and brighten and even my skin tone.",
