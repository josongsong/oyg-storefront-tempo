Its gentle, has a pleasant scent, gives you the richest foam put of any foam cleanser I've ever used, clears up and prevents acne…it's just perfect, and I really hope the formula never changes or this gets discotinued. It's on sale now and I bought 4 bottles and honestly might get more because its not usually on sale…so now I'm REALLY hoping it isn't being phased out.",

From it's description, this is a face wash meant to \"control oil, while salicylic acid helps minimize the appearance of pores. Glycolic and lactic acids help exfoliate surface layers of skin for smoother, softer texture.\" I recommend this is as a morning face wash. It reminds me a bit of the \nShiseido Complete Cleansing Microfoam - intentional dupe or not, I don't know, but I know I really like this face wash.",

Got my rough texture all the way together and my skin always felt clean but not tight and dried. Dewy and ready for the rest of my regimen. \n\nNote: I use the Salicylic Acid moisturizer by CeraVe with this cleanser. Great pairing.",

I was excited to try this because my skin has been acting up lately so i thought maybe a new product could help. I was a bit nervous however because I have veryyyyy sensitive skin that can be quite acne prone and I just get allergic reactions to random things. I have been using this wash for a few days though and no problems yet! I find it to be not drying at all which can be a problem I have with even moisturizing products for dry skin so that is a plus! ( i hate that tight feeling your face gets when you wash ti and this doesn't do that!) i deff will keep using it to see if it helps clear up the spots i've been breaking out in lately and would definitely try this wash with other florence by mills skincare products to see if a new routine would help me! The only thing i would considered a \"con\" of this product is the scent, I just was expecting it to be scent free for some reason so i was surprised by its strong smell. It isn't bad and I actually like that it isn't added fragrance (just essential oil) but it was just a bit strong at first! I like lavender however so if you like that you will be fine, if you dont then you might find it a bit strong! overall I am happy with the product and will continue to use it to see how it helps my skin!",

        "comments": "Hello! I received a sample product for the #florencepanel and I couldn't be more thankful for the opportunity. Unfortunately I did not have a good experience. It felt nice and refreshing at first, but within three days, patches of my skin became flaky, red, dry, and would sting when other products were applied. I have dry skin, where foam cleansers should be carefully used. I'll continue to use it (after repairing my skin) under three times per week. Be careful, loves. If this happens, remove actives (such as vitamin C and niacinamide), switch to a gentle cleanser (like the Clean Magic Face Wash) and search for products to fix your barrier. I'm sorry to be such a downer, but then again this could be GREAT for others!! Everyone's skin is different. And unfortunately, this product isn't for me. Happy Cleansing, dearies 💔.",
