It has a great little brow brush that helps to blend the strokes flawlessly. But the real gamechanger is the wax! It looks thick in the jar, but goes on very nicely - with a light coating - not waxy or greasy. The applicator is firm and angled - so it is very easy to use, and the brush on the opposite side of the wax applicator is perfect for getting the brow hairs to behave, helping them to look sleek and styled. I love this product - easily one of the best that I have recently purchased.",

It's got a curve in the bristles that can't be undone unless I find a way to put some weight on it to flatten it out. If anyone from Morphe reads this, you should really think about putting the brush end in a plastic tube to protect it from getting bent from being in a plastic baggie and being stored downside in the box and letting gravity do it's business. Would have been 5 stars if that wasn't an issue.",
