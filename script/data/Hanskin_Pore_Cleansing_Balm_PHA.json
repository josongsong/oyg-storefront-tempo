I feel like it's important to cleanse the face first by loosening up the make up before washing it with your daily cleanser. This product easily does that for me! I have waterproof mascara and eyeliner and it definitely gets most of the residue out of my eyes! It can be a little messy, so i would recommend using a small amount at a time, it goes a long way! I didn't break out from it, if anything, it made my face less irritated compared to make up wipes I used before. Highly recommend!",

Personally, I think the mix of oils in this creates a scent that is just too strong for me, especially for something that I'm putting all over my face. Also, be sure to read the instructions and rub the balm on your DRY face, then wash off with water! I initially was using it after wetting my face and noticed that it wasn't really taking anything off. I usually rub it in for about a 30 seconds to a minute (especially for eye makeup removal) and it seems to be a bit more effective that way. Just not in love with it, I'm definitely going to try a different brand after I finish up this balm.",
