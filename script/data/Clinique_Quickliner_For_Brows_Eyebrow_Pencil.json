        "comments": "I was at Ulta and having trouble finding the right color of brow, pencil that wasn't too waxy. When one consultant couldn't help me find anything in the sea of cosmetic brands, he asked another for help and she brought me right to Clinique counter. The soft chestnut looked to be the right color (close enough)... but would it be soft enough for effortless placement, check. Was the tip skinny enough for realistic hairlike strokes? 1/2 check. Yes at first, then no with no way to sharpen... but it's the best one I have found so far. Does it stay on? Check. I train horses in the Texas heat and it's still on at the end of the day. Impressive! and will be repurchasing! Is there a lot of product for the money? This is the biggest drawback to this pencil along with not being able to keep the tip sharp. I ran out of product in less than a month, so it gets costly. I will repurchase when it's on sale. Please make pencils for strawberry blonde hair. We do not have bright red or auburn hair and the names of the colors make it difficult to find a match. Just name the colors to whom they are intended. Within the sea of pencils, I thought Clinique had nothing to offer me and had it not been for the Ulta consultant, I would have had no idea Soft Chestnut existed. All over, I subtracted one point, because it's good, not perfect!",

        "comments": "First I want to say I love, love, love this brow pencil, the fine point makes it so easy to add the fine lines I need to fill in my brows and the color I use is perfect and I've been using it since you introduced it.\nBut then there's the quantity of product vs the price; \nIt's always been a lot to pay for a product that lasts about 30 days but since it works so well for me I continued to purchase it. \nI tried the brow shaper to fill in and that was a fail because the brush applies too much product. Recently I purchased the Clinique Brow pencil with highlighter, another fail because the pencil so thick it blots out the fine lines of the quickliner. \nThen last month I ordered a new quickliner not realizing the product had been changed and the price had gone up considerably.. The spoolie you've is too small and hard to be useful and considering the price for a 30 day supply was already too high and now it's even higher. For me those changes make this a fail as well. \nIf you could make the container longer why not add more product instead of a useless brush ??? \nYou've lost me with this latest \"improvement\". \nI've used Clinique products for over 35 years, love that none of your products irritate my skin and will continue to use the skin care line as well as a your lipliner and mascara but even though I haven't been happy with other brow pencils I've tried I'll have to find another company's product I can make do with.",
