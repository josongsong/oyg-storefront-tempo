I've even had my teen start using this after his worlouts at school. It's so good I have completely stopped using my cereve and cetaphil products. I trashed them all.  My breakouts are all starting to go away and heal. Even the ones that have been there for years. Now I'm just dealing with the scars. But, I'm still so happy on how much it's improved. I didnt want to right a review at first because I started to become so skeptical on if I would ever find a product that worked. However, Its been 2 months and I'm so thankful I tried this brand. I will be buying this brand for our skin needs going forward.",

        "comments": "⭐️ I received this Pure Cleansing Water Sensitive for free from Manyo and Picky. \n\n💜First off you get a huge 16.9 Fl oz bottle. This will definitely last you awhile and is very reasonably priced. Its texture/color is literally like water, no sticky feeling, and has no scent at all. I actually used this a couple different ways. To remove makeup, and to cleanse in my double cleanse routine. As a makeup remover it did remove most makeup, but it did leave some of my stubborn waterproof makeup behind. Now as a regular cleanser is where I felt it really shined and my preferred use. It definitely exfoliated my skin by removing any excess sebum, so it made my skin very smooth. I have large pores; and it penetrated deep into them to thoroughly clean, and made them unnoticeable. It never dried out my skin and made it very hydrated. Along with never breaking me out, so it really is great for sensitive skin. It never even burned my eyes when I went over them! With some cleansing/micellar water they leave a film behind, and this product did not. I use this as my 2nd cleanse after my oil based face wash/cleanser. Water based products should be last in your cleansing routine. I love the way my skin feels and looks using this. It also was easy to apply onto a cotton swab. I will definitely continue to use this and highly recommend it!\n\n❌The only negative and reason why I deducted 1 star is that I wish it removed all my makeup. It unfortunately left behind some of my waterproof products. You will need to use another cleanser before this to fully remove all makeup.",

Since then, I've always kept at least one MANYO product in my routine, and their Pure Cleansing Water Sensitive is no exception!\n\nThis cleansing water is incredibly gentle yet so effective—it removes makeup in seconds without leaving my dry, sensitive skin feeling stripped or tight. It has no fragrance, which is a huge win for me, and the formula feels so soothing. I also love the sleek packaging, which makes it a treat to use every day.\n\nI've been pairing it with the MANYO cleansing oil, and together they're the ultimate dream team for a thorough yet gentle double cleanse. My skin feels clean, soft, and perfectly balanced after every use. Highly recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin!",

I also use it sometimes just to clean and refresh my face when it's feeling hot and sweaty from all of this summer heat. To my surprise, it removes a lot of dirt and caked up grime.

This will definitely last you awhile and is very reasonably priced. Its texture/color is literally like water, no sticky feeling, and has no scent at all. I actually used this a couple different ways. To remove makeup, and to cleanse in my double cleanse routine. As a makeup remover it did remove most makeup, but it did leave some of my stubborn waterproof makeup behind. Now as a regular cleanser is where I felt it really shined and my preferred use. It definitely exfoliated my skin by removing any excess sebum, so it made my skin very smooth. I have large pores; and it penetrated deep into them to thoroughly clean, and made them unnoticeable. It never dried out my skin and made it very hydrated. Along with never breaking me out, so it really is great for sensitive skin. It never even burned my eyes when I went over them! With some cleansing/micellar water they leave a film behind, and this product did not. I use this as my 2nd cleanse after my oil based face wash/cleanser. Water based products should be last in your cleansing routine. I love the way my skin feels and looks using this. It also was easy to apply onto a cotton swab. I will definitely continue to use this and highly recommend it!\n\n❌The only negative and reason why I deducted 1 star is that I wish it removed all my makeup. It unfortunately left behind some of my waterproof products. You will need to use another cleanser before this to fully remove all makeup.",

This claims to be for sensitive skin, but it burns and leaves little red bumps (irritation marks) around my face. I should have stuck with what I knew but took a shot with this and highly regret it. I gave it two stars because it may work for others who aren't as sensitive as I am.",
