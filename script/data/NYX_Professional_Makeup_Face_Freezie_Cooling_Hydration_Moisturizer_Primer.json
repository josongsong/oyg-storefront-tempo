I am stovking up because who knows how long itll be around. Blurred, cooled, moisturized, and gripped my makeup. Made my under eyes look more youthful. 11/10 recommend.    ps: i never leave reviews",

After multiple uses, I can confidently say that this product does nothing for me (literally). My skin feels no different when I put it on, and I haven't noticed it making my makeup look better or last longer compared to not wearing a primer at all. The cooling effect makes it not for use around the eyes, but that's exactly where I need my primer to focus on my concealer. Disappointed that NYX traded their Angel Veil shelf space for this product line… definitely not worth the price tag!",

This is the first primer that i have used that doesn't leave my face looking dry & patchy after using foundation & powder. It also is very cooling so be careful around your eyes. It's also very good for sensitive skin & hasn't caused acne tk break-out. The only reason I'm taking a star off is because I don't really see any difference with my pores. I absolutely recommend this especially if most primers cause you to break-out.",
