        "comments": "This stuff is great! I've been using it for years as recommended by my Dermatologist. Very gentle and effective to not lead to additional breakouts on my sensitive skin. I feel like so many of the bad reviews are people not understanding how products work or how this product works. This product will not work for you if you are mostly dry. And will backfire on you, causing other skin issues and leading you to think it's not working, when really you are using the wrong product for your skin type. This product is pretty gentle. So for those saying they didn't feel \"clean\" afterwards, it's because you're most likely use to bad products stripping the natural good oils from your face. Your skin should never feel tight after using a facial product; tight skin does not equal clean. Also please consult a dermatologist before choosing products that are right for you.",

        "comments": "Honestly I've tried so many other cleansers over the years and this is the only one that consistently gets my acne under control. I have oily combo skin and this is consistently the one one that works for me without additional side effects. Now this is not a makeup remover and if you're prone to skin build up you should use an exfoliant paired with it as it can dry your skin out (but I prefer that). I literally use an Aveeno lotion and this paired with a light exfoliant every few days and as long as I'm consistent my skin is perfect and clear. I have other skin issues that this product can't address but they're minimized with the use of this product.",

I am still trying to get rid of the mess it made to my skin. \nIt doesn't foam whenever you are washing your face so it just made my face feel slimy; probably not the best description, but it just never felt clean. Then the pimples started and it was everywhere. I eliminated all products and this is the one that was doing it. I would not use this is you have combo, oily, or acne prone skin. Definitely just get medical grade skincare and safe yourself the trouble or having to fix your skin.",

I use my fingertips and gently rub it all over my face, and over the affected areas. At first I though it wouldn't work because it is so gentle and doesn't form a lather which made me wonder if it was \"working.\" After the shower, I let my face air dry and then with clean hands put on Mario Badescu's A.H.A. & Ceramide Moisturizer. Together it has improved my skin dramatically. I started using Mario Badescu's product on March 29, and began taking pictures every 1-2 weeks to see if my skin was improving. It definitely has improved and no other product has been able to do this. It is now August 4, and my skin is more clear than it has ever been. The scars I hated and attempted to cover with makeup have faded away and I have had 1-2 pimples but even those disappear quickly and the scars fade fast. Don't feel discouraged if you get a pimple, take pictures and continue, you will see it works! I am extremely happy! Also, I have not had to purchase another bottle of either one; but I will soon, since I'm almost out, and I use both every single day. Definitely worth the money!",

        "comments": "Yet another Mario B. product that has disappointed me. I wanted to like this, because it has minimal ingredients and no fragrance that can irritate skin. But I am not extremely oily, so using this all over my face outside of my slightly oily T-zone was a big mistake. It did clear up some bad blemishes I'd gotten from a horrible foundation I'd used, but after they were gone and I kept washing with this sometimes twice a day, my entire face began flaking and painfully peeling. I had to use moisturizers to try and fix it, which just sadly started the acne cycle all over again! I wasn't as adamant about checking ingredients when I bought this impulsively, and lo and behold, it contains straight up Isopropyl Alcohol that makes normal to combo skin bone dry. Mario B. seems to love using cheap ingredients like IA yet upcharges as an elite brand, what a joke! Use this at your own risk. I guess if you have extremely bad skin drenched in oil, it might be a temporary fix, but it's not good for longterm acne solutions.",
