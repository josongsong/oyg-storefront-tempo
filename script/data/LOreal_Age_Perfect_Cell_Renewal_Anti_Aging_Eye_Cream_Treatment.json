I don't have crow feets but have a couple fine lines under my eyes which haven't diminished completely but definitely have soften. Plus, this cream works well under my Tarte concealer. My under eyes look more hydrated. I didn't have bad dark circles but my under eyes look more awake too. I have used so many eye creams over the years and this is the best one I've used. My only complaint like other reviewers is the bottle it comes in. But that's a small price to pay for a cream that actually works.",

After a couple of weeks, I noticed my under-eyes looked smoother and more awake, with less puffiness. I love the texture and how easily it absorbs. The only downside was the pump—it stopped working halfway through the bottle, which made it harder to get the rest of the product out. Still, the formula itself is wonderful, and I'd definitely repurchase it.",

Big mistake. There is absolutelly nothing special about this product, it's about as basic as you can get. I was really expecting something special, I guess my expectations were just too high. Also annoying that the pump broke after maybe a month of usage. I had to break the top/pump open in order to get the rest of the product out. Will probably just toss it, it's not worth the effort.",

        "comments": "I've been using this eye cream for a few months, and I love it! Absorbs quickly, doesn't cause my eye makeup to bleed and smear, and keeps my skin plumped and youthful! However, I will echo many comments here about the packaging design. First of all, the black glass makes it impossible for you to see when it's getting low. But most aggravating is that the pump does not twist off (easily) so you can get to the last of the product. I tried several times, bought a replacement bottle, and finally gave it one last time before it went in the garbage. I popped it off! Inside I found plenty of product at the bottom and around the sides of the bottle. I'm here now, a month later, still scooping product out of that bottle with the pump tube as a spatula. SO MUCH WASTED PRODUCT if I hadn't been able to pop it off! \n\nI'm having a similar issue with my L'Oréal Invisible Lift foundation. Ironically, that bottle is round, and the top WILL NOT TWIST OFF. I can SEE how much product is left, and that's really annoying. Is this L'Oréal's MO? Design the packages so customers buy more frequently instead of giving them access to every drop of product?\n\nI challenge the L'Oréal package design team to come up with something more consumer friendly and less wasteful.",

I was using Clinique Repair wear Anti-Gravity eye cream  & its 2 yrs old yet, still half-full because I hadn't been using much eye cream or wearing much makeup during the pandemic & Clinique didn't seem to be working well, I liked Daily Eye Benefits however, it had been discontinued years ago. I thought I would try a different brand of eye cream. I tried Estee Lauder night eye cream 2 weeks ago & it irritated my eyes and seemed to cause more wrinkles. I read many positive reviews about one of the L'Oreal Eye Defense creams so, I thought I would try L'Oreal for the first time & the Eye Defense was not in stock at the store. I liked the packaging & the pump container plus it seemed like it would be one of their best eye creams so, I bought it.  As cliche as it sounds...I couldn't believe my eyes...it worked very well & some of my wrinkles almost completely vanished right after I applied it...compared to other some brands that gave me extra wrinkles...its much better than anticipated. Plus it was non-irritating.",

I truly love the texture and I'm very finicky about the texture of any eye, cream or moisturizers around my eyes. I don't like it to be too occlusive or balmy-it was quite hydrating and gel like. It is said to help with crows feet, dark circles and puffiness. I have not use this product that long, but I have seen a fair amount of contour around the eyelids with crepiness. In my opinion, this is for the ladies that are trying to reduce puffiness and any upper lid creepiness it has amazing antioxidants, which is proven to shield all free radicals and environmental aggressors from that delicate eye area. The hydration is so nice and I'm sure that it comes from the amazing vitamin E ingredient. It does have a very nice ingredient deck as well. One of the top ingredients is glycerin, which is even better than the standard hyaluronic acid. When it comes to hydration, glycerin holds about 4000 times its weight in water and can draw water from the environment and reinforce into the skins layers. It also has adenosine and caffeine, major blood constrictors beneath the surface of the skin to give that firm contoured finish creating less of a puffy/baggy effect. Are use this every morning and every night before I put on my serum and moisturizer.",

Black splotches were all over my bathroom vanity and I could not figure where this was coming from for a while. Well it was from the bottle mainly the bottom of the bottle. Loreal you need to fix this, juts make it a clear container? The coating on the container comes oof and makes a real mess, and its hard to clean up. As far as the eye cream I not sure yet if it does anything.",
