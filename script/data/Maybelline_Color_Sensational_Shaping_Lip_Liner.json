I had never used it before and was pleasantly surprised to see how long it lasted. I put it on around 3 and drank a whole bottle of water and a can of Dr Pepper, I ate, and the color was still on and hadn't smudged off at all. So it is definitely long wear which is awesome. I also liked the fact that it is a buildable color. One layer gives you a fairly natural look which is nice for everyday, if you add on a couple of more layers you get a dark sultry lip. Definitely wanna try this in other colors as well.",
