I'm definitely not bashing Cetaphil because it works for my husband just fine and I see the other reviews where people love it but for me personally it broke me out really bad. I have clear (combination) skin other than the occasional breakout due to hormones and black heads due to big pores but breaking out as bad as I did using Cetaphil threw me off. My chin dried out pretty bad to the point my moisturizer (Peach slices) didn't help, my cheeks and forehead were really oily as well. It got to the point where a new zit was popping up everyday, not only on my face but my neck as well which is unusual for me. I only used Cetaphil for a couple of weeks before I threw in the towel and went back to get my usual Peach slices snail rescue face wash and the toner to try and get my face under control. After using my usual stuff for my usual routine, including pimple patches, after a day my face is back to normal. That old saying \"if it ain't broke, dont fix it\" applies here and i'll be sticking to my usual routine.",

Protecting my skin barrier is necessary, but most gentle cleansers (looking at you, cerave) do nothing to cleanse my skin. This is amazing. It is a light foam, no fragrance, and leaves my skin clean without tightness. Face wasn't red after washing and I can tell this is exactly what I've been searching for. I actually bought this at another store, but it's so good I'm posting the review here too for anyone on the fence lol.",

This product removes sunscreen and makeup easily. 1 to 2 pumps is all that it takes for a clean, fresh and soft feeling complexion. This product does not stink or smell like vomit, a previous review has claimed. This product is \"fragrance free\", thus what you smell is the formula in its natural state. Fragrance causes irritation and allergic reactions. I love this product and highly recommend it!",
