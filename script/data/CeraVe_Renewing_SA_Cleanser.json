        "comments": "It's odd to see so many telling others NOT to buy this product because of their personal experience. Skincare is subjective and personal  and how one's skin reacts to this is highly dependent on skin type and skin care routine.\n\nAt one time, I used the SA cleanser along with a kitchen sink approach toward getting rid of my acne to include Benzoyl Peroxide cream, retinol etc. So, yeah, I got the expected result: burning, inflamed skin. I got what I deserved because you can't do that and expect a prize.\n\nAnyway, I now use this AM & PM, and let me tell you: it's been the missing link to my routine. My skin has never been more vibrant and supple, and my pores are now clear and appear smaller. My skin texture went from orange peel to newborn baby's rear end in two weeks with zero irritation.\n\nSo, moral of this review is try these products for yourself to see what your skin can tolerate. Do start slowly, perhaps use once per day, and avoid other exfoliating ingredients initially. You can add one back in once your skin acclimates to the SA. I now can use retinol after this at night, vitamin C after this in the morning and I have DRY, SENSITIVE skin. So, success is possible.",

I have dry, sensitive skin, and when I used to get breakouts, they would be painful and longlasting, taking several weeks to go fully through each pimple's life cycle. Benzoyl peroxide is really drying for me so I hated having to use that constantly. I started using this cleanser (which doesn't dry me out at all), and now when i have breakouts, the pimples last a literal FRACTION of the time they used to! They cycle through in about 3 days now and I rarely have to use spot treatments anymore. \n\nI can't say enough about how well this has worked for me. Again, just remember you have to be patient and use this consistently over time! I do occasionally have sensitive skin flareups that this cleanser is too much for, so on those days, I switch to a gentle cleanser, but largely I've had zero issues with this one being too strong.",

I break out sometimes with those nasty big zits underneath your skin, but since using Cerave SA Cleanser, I have not had any of those!  I love how my skin feels and looks after washing with this.  I sometimes us a Clarasonic brush, and other times, just a Buff Puff pad.  The pores in my T zone area actually look smaller.  I believe this is the salacylic acid working to deep clean the pores, which in turn, makes them appear smaller since they are not clogged up.   I also use the Cerave SA lotion underneath my makeup now as my moisturizer and so far so good.  In addition to using the SA lotion on my face,I slather it on my legs after shaving and it has been helping with ingrown hairs on legs too. For the price, an 8 oz bottle lasts a long time so it's a great value.  Even better is how much I like it.  I'm hooked on Cerave now for life.  Excellent products that work for much less than those commercial brands, so what more could you ask for?",
