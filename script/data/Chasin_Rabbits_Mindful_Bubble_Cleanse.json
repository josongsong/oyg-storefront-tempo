        "comments": "Not gonna lie i have tried everything, peach & lily for over a year & it stopped working, ive tried Laroche Posay, SoonJung, anything you can think of ive tried. I stumbled across this & i was like, im tired of being let down so i was hesitant. I get cystic acne, blackheads, etc, super sensitive skin, oily & on the dehydrated side. Ive used this for 2-3 weeks & see the biggest difference in my face. My skin is soft, not steipped, black heads on my nose.. gone, pores have shrunk. Im starting to feel beautiful again because of it, my skin has always been a huge insecurity for me. If your skin sounds anything like mine, & youre hesitant… just take the chance. I also bought the mushroom skin toner to pair with it- & cut all other products out. Not to mention it has no harsh chemicals in it at all. New holy grail.",
