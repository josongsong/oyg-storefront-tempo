I use the sparkle for eye shadow and the bronzer as eye shadow as well as bronzer. The blush is very pigmented so i just tap it and apply just a bit. \nIts so handy to have it all in one spot and I have received so many compliments from my coworkers , I've been a little shocked! This is a great palette, you wont be disappointed!",

It eliminates taking separate pieces...all you need is foundation, mascara and eyeliner...and some lipgloss or lipstick...very compact with stunning results. The only thing i would suggest is making the opening a little easier by replacing the current one with an easy press button as I find myself fumbling to open it and concerned that I may drop it and break it.  One easy press would help especially for people that are somewhat challenged.",

Time to listen to all of the ladies who love your product and hate the \"clasp\" .  I also agree that the highlighter fell apart pretty quickly while the others stayed intact. Obviously, the need for more highlighter is what we want. It could stop the sales of this wonderful idea-why not tweak it and flow on?!!:-)  It would be great to  see you actually satisfy all issues- this could be so many women's mainstay!! Make the entire amount given  thicker (more highlighter as well) and  lose the present method of  opening.  All positive ? all good? Well time to step up! Thank you :-)",
