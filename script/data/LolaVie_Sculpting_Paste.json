        "comments": "My hair os about the length of JA in the photos on here and this sculpting paste has made my hair so tangly every time I've tried to use it. I follow the directions, only apply a little, let it set then brush it through and all day my hair tangles so much and is sticky to the touch. I got it with hopes it would tame the flyaways and hold my style when I curl my hair but instead of soft curls they're rough, not shiny, and hard to comb through. I have straight, fine hair so it might work better on thick wavy hair, or the tangles could even be worse. Sad because it actually does help to tame flyaways and frizz but I can't deal with the tangles. For slick back up dos it probably works great.",

This paste is amazing but I wouldn't suggest a nickel size to start with as they recommend.  I only rubbed a very small amount between my palms and went straight for the roots on top and sides and lifted and finger combed towards the back.   The volume was exactly what I was looking for and my hair stayed out of my face and in place for the rest of the day!  It's a subtle but perfect finishing step, at least it is for me.",

I've been a long time user of the manipulator and matte-stermind from Bedhead but I typically only get wavy hair or I end up styling my hair straight with those two products. A little go a long way with this formula, I typically apply half of a pump on damp or dry hair whenever I need to tame freeze and also enhance the curls in my hair. Smells exactly like all the other LOLAVIE products, which is a pleasant Lemon/Keylime scent and doesn't make my hair oily or limp either. I've even used it on a spoolie & brushed it through my brows and flyaways whenever I was in a hurry.",

        "comments": "I recently ordered the sculpting paste. First of all, I want to say how much I love the scent. It's intoxicating, truly. If you decide to expand your product line, consider adding body wash, body lotion, and a body spray. I would not hesitate to buy these additional products and it's one of the reasons I also ordered the shampoo recently! Secondly, I really enjoyed the benefits of the sculpting paste for two different reasons. I'm 51 and noticed last year I began to have a few unruly white hairs. My hairdresser and I have decided there are not enough of these wiry white hairs to commit to color just yet, but they can create some issues with styling. In addition to this, I noticed that due to my decrease in estrogen due to my age, my hair was thinning a little. I decided to commit to medication to help with may hair growth last fall. I've kept my hair in a stylish bob for the past few years. Since taking the medication, I noted A LOT of new \"baby hairs\". These also create a problem in styling. The sculpting paste not only resolved these two issues, but help my style to stay in place, even on \"bad hair\" days. I am a nurse and work long hours. I usually use a round brush and blow dryer for styling, but sometimes give my hair a break and where it naturally, which is a wavy\"ish\" pattern. The sculpting paste works for both styles. It is easy to use and as I mentioned, smells amazing. I look forward to receiving the shampoo. I received the sculpting paste much quicker than I expected. The packaging was excellent and I feel the price point is reasonable for a high end product, especially since the amount of product required is not too much. I know people are quick to send complaints, but I've always believed good feedback is appreciated as well. I have always loved Jennifer Anniston on TV and in movies, so when she introduced the new product, I was excited to try it. This product lives up to the marketing and I have really enjoyed using it so far. Thanks, Jaime M. Walker, RN",

        "comments": "First: This made my short, silver hair look fantastic.    Second: It caused an allergic reaction that sent me to the doctor and caused me to spend weeks trying to figure out what was causing it!     I have a tree allergy, especially birch and alder (the most common tree allergies, BTW). After using this the first time, my eyes swelled and I broke out with a rash around them that necessitated a prescription from my dermatologist. I kept thinking \"this only happens when I've been in areas where there are a lot of these trees...\" and I hadn't been. Guess what, hidden in the multitude of ingredients in this sculpting paste, disguised by Latin species name, these is birch extract, of all freaking things! I completely understand that new products need proprietary formulas to prevent copying and also to protect the celebrities associated with the products from lawsuits claiming they copied a formula, for for the love of all that is beauty, please be cautious with the botanicals!",
