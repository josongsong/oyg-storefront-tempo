The ONLY thing that annoys me (and it REALLY annoys me) is that BB changes the label every few years, which causes a PANIC because you never know if you're getting the same product, so you actually have to read the old and new ingredient list side-by-side to make sure what you're buying is the same!  It used be called Thickening Spray, THEN Thickening Hairspray, NOW it's called Thickening Spray Pre-Styler.  LEAVE THE NAME OF THE PRODUCT ALONE.  Plus, the new label also now makes it sound like the product is ONLY good for blow-drying.  It's honestly the most pointless and confusing approach to marketing ever.  Other than those marketing errors, the product itself is fabulous.",

        "comments": "I was amazed at the outstanding reviews and thus ordered the product. The internet ad stated it's key ingredients--however failed to list a type of alcohol in a very high percentage as the main ingredient! That explained why it virtually stripped dry my finely textured very light blonde hair that is in very good condition. The chemical odor was overpowering and it remained on my hair & collar. After a few hours I finally had to remove my garment and launder it to remove the odor. So, this product may truly work for those whose hair is not affected by high doses of drying alcohol and those who are not chemically sensitive, but for me it was a loss of nearly 30 bucks. It didn't add body or thickness as stated. I do wonder if this review will be published.",
