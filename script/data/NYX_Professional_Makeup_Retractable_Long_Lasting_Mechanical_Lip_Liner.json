The color payoff is great and they do an honorable job of lining your lips and keeping whatever you put on top of them in place. I will say that these can be a bit drying and can tug on your lips (or require some work to get the color payoff that they are capable of), but for the price that's really not a problem. I know that if I wanted a smooth-as-silk lip liner I would be buying it from a high-end line like Dior or Armani. These really are great for the price and it can be a good thing that they need some tug to go on: it means that once they're on, they aren't going anywhere!",
