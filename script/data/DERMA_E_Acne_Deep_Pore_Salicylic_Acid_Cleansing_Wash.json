I bought this because it was vegan, and im 3 weeks in. Seems to have cleared a lot of my acne, and i havent been breaking out as much as i used to. (especially before a period) Hoping this outcome still lasts. Feels super clean on my skin, and the smell isnt horrible. Cheaper than other cleansers Ive tried, especially because they havent worked as good as this one is seeming to work. I use this cleanser along with the Tula toner + moisturizer. I also recommend the miracle spray.",

        "comments": "I have tried so many products throughout the years. I've had acne since I was 13 and I'm in my late 20s now. Trust me, this product is amazing. I have sensitive skin but I hate buying all those \"natural, organic, sensitive skin\" etc products because they do absolutely nothing. My skin has cleared up A LOT over a period of 2 weeks with this derma-e cleanser and it actually looks like healthy skin!\n\nI use one or two pumps of this product and just lather it on my face at night before bed or after a long day of being out to remove all of my makeup. I lather and massage it for about 3 minutes then just rinse and pat dry. Maybe two or three times a week I use an electronic cleanser brush with a pump or two of the derma-e and just hold the wet spin brush for about 15-20 seconds until I have cleansed my entire face then pat dry. In the mornings I only rinse my face with cool water and pat dry, unless I feel that my skin is too oily, then I just use a half pump and lather it on my face and pat dry then apply moisturizer.\n\nI follow this up with a lactic acid serum for acne treatment and jelly moisturizer or only the moisturizer depending how my skin is doing that day. \n\nI don't like using oil free moisturizers (or oil free products in general) because I notice that those make my acne worse. \n\nAlso the smell is not horrible. It just smells like witch hazel, so if you don't like that smell, you probably won't like this.",

        "comments": "I struggle with hormonal acne and breakout primarily along my jaw, the sides of my face, and on my temples. I really wanted to love this product because it was vegan and cruelty free, but my face said NOPE. The first few days were fine, and I thought I noticed a reduction in the redness of my skin. But soon, I had broken out literally EVERYWHERE. Even on parts of my face that don't get acne. It produced three extremely painful cysts along my right temple, a myriad of comedones and bumps on my forehead, and more painful cysts on my cheeks. Of course, I figured I was purging. So I kept trying, using this facewash twice a day for around two weeks. And it just. Kept. Getting. Worse. It got to the point where my face was so inflamed that I hated looking at my appearance.\n\nKeep in mind that I don't have sensitive skin, and I didn't change anything else in my routine. I was shocked at how bad the breakout was, so I stopped using the facewash immediately. Fast forward two weeks later and a switch back to Cetaphil, and my face is finally getting back on track. The cysts are still healing and will probably leave scars due to how prominent they were, and I still have texture all over my face.\n\nWhile this product may have worked for others, it definitely did not work for me. Everyone's skin is different, so all I can say is try at your own risk. \n\nAlso, side note, the smell wasn't necessarily bad. But I hated washing my face and knowing that I was putting so many unnecessary essential oils and fragrances on my already acne-prone skin. Do yourself a favor and try to find a better alternative that doesn't rely on essential oils like Derma-E.",
