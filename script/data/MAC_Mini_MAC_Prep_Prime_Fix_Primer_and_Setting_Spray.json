I will also say this frangrance yall are smelling….i dont smell it?? i mean yeah it definitely smells like something but its not like extremely fragranced or anything so maybe yall are getting bad batches bc like i said i have acne prone skin so fragranced products are a no for me and i dont really smell it at all which i also love !! i realy recommend if you wear a full base like i do almost daily this spray really helps with cakeyness and refreshing my makeup look. i highly recommend!!!",

The OG was perfect, I would soak my face and let it dry and it would just melt everything together. This new formula feels like it has more alcohol so you can soak your face and it just dries up shortly after (in order to change the bottle for a fine mist, they would have to change the formula, and they did). It's just another setting spray now. Reminds me a lot of the Milani Make it Last setting spray but a lot more expensive. I'll stick with the Elf dewy coconut setting spray for now. I have combo skin and I like a dewy airbrushed look.",

This was the #1 products I heard people talking about. I was skeptical, like so many others, but I tried it and instantly fell in love.\n\nI personally use this to sandwich in my makeup. I moisturize, prime, spray Fix+, apply my makeup, then spray Fix+ again to set it. I have really dry skin, so this is great for adding moisture. Also, it doesn't take much for my makeup to look \"cakey\". If I spend a little too much time buffing product into my skin, then conceal and powder, it can add up quickly. It doesn't take much product on my skin to really build up. This is great in those cases. Even if you maybe applied a little too much powder, spraying this will take away some of the dryness and buildup.\n\nI also have to rave about the packaging. I've been using it for months now, and every time I've sprayed it, it has been a consistent, light mist. You never have to worry about large drops of the product hitting your skin to create patchy areas. It's always consistent and solid. It also locks for travel, so it won't spill out in your bag.\n\nThis is also great for intensifying the color of your eyeshadow and refreshing your skin and makeup throughout the day!",

I spray it on my makeup brush so the full coverage makeup goes on smoother, I also spray it on my face after powder to set. It smells fabulous and it does help your making last longer. I am really disappointed in the new spray head on the bottle. I'm not sure how long ago they made the change since I haven't ordered this in a while. I still have my old bottle and the difference is night and day. My old bottle will lightly mist the product on to your face. The bottle I received last week litteraly streams it out. I can no longer just spray directly on to my face. I have to spray it on my wrist and dab my brush in it to apply. The first time I went to set my makeup my face was dripping wet from one pump and I had to redo that portion of my makeup.",
