Dispense one pump or a pearl-size amount of Natural Radiant Longwear Foundation and warm with fingertips.

I wear Gobi and its always a pretty glow finish, this new bottle was completely orange & dry! The shade is not the same whatsoever. Nothing is the same.

It applies so easily and it is so smooth! In my opinion it does blend better with the beauty blender vs a brush, but both ways blended extremely well I just prefer the beauty blender. This is honestly one of the most light weight foundations I have ever worn, like seriously it didn't even feel like there was anything on my face at all! It did deliver later in the afternoon and I tried it as soon as I got it so I only had about 5 hours of wear time and I was just kind of hanging out doing some chores around the house and took the dogs out for a long walk but through sweat and everything it held up so well! It looks so smooth on the face, it doesn't get cakey at all, even at the end of the 5 hour period! I am interested to see how long it actually does last as it boasts a 16 hour wear, I will be wearing this one to work on Monday so we will see how well she does over an even longer period! Last but not least the coverage was quite lovely, I would say more of a medium coverage but definitely buildable to a full if you desire! Overall an AMAZING foundation that is now number 1 in my collection now! (Side note I am loving this lip in the attached picture also from Nars, it's the Velvet Matte lip pencil in the shade Cruella and then the Afterglow Lip Shine in the shade Broken Glass over-top, so hot!) You will 100% not regret this purchase!!",
