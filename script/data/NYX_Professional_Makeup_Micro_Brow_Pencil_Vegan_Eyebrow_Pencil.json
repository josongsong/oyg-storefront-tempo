A few swipes with the spoolie, soft \"line\" just above and below brows, then fill in...spoolie quickly again to soften color, and tiny bit of wax to keep them set. I did both in less than 5 minutes, and also used the NYX \"magic\" pencil to highlight/clean up. Highly recommend both! Side note - I was really unsure what color to get. I'm a natural light/medium ash brunette, but I dye it much darker. I hate any orange/red tones, and taupes just kinda of look \"off.\" I got the ash brown pencil, and it's PERFECT!",

The color blonde was extremely yellow! My hair color is blonde and I usually use ABH brow wiz in taupe. And that is even a little too dark for me. But the NYX blonde looked terrible. Borderline high lighter yellow! There is no \"ash blonde\" or \"taupe\" just a scary yellow lol. As for the auburn color. It was ok. I used it in my sister. She is a red head. I had to put a darker powder over it. It is good for a light red head. The quality of the pencils are great! The colors need major improvement!",
