As someone with sensitive skin, finding a cleanser that effectively removes makeup and debris without causing irritation can be a challenge. However, this product proved to be a game-changer.  The application process was a delight. The cleanser starts as a golden gel-oil infused with Sea Buckthorn Oil, which feels luxurious on the skin. I simply massaged it onto my face and eyes, and it effectively melted away layers of makeup, sebum, and sunscreen. Upon contact with water, the gel-oil transformed into a rich, cloud-like foam, creating a refreshing and satisfying cleansing experience.  After rinsing off the foam, my skin felt incredibly clean and refreshed. I was pleasantly surprised by how soft and smooth it felt instantly. The product's plant-derived prebiotic seemed to work wonders, leaving my skin with a healthy glow. My skin felt rejuvenated and ready for the next steps in my skincare routine.  Overall, Dermalogica's oil to foam total cleanser has become an essential part of my skincare routine. It effectively removes makeup and debris, leaving my skin feeling ultra-clean and smooth. If you're looking for a versatile cleanser suitable for all skin types, I highly recommend giving this product a try.",

        "comments": "This is a decent basic cleanser but theres not much more to it. The gel oil is super runny and liquidy and almost immediately turns to foam whether on dry, damp, or wet skin. It struggled to take off my non-waterproof mascara that usually melts off immediately with other cleansing oils and balms. As someone who loves an oil based cleanser, this is just nowhere near that experience, much more like a simple gel to foam. It does however get nicely foamy and is very gentle so I would definitely recommend this for sensitive or irritated skin, along with another makeup remover if needed. Overall I like this brand and know the ingredients are good, but I wasn't impressed. Oil based makeup deep cleanser? No. Gentle safe foamy cleanser, yes. This product was gifted to me complimentary",
