It removes makeup effortlessly, isn't stripping or irritating to my skin, and works great for lazy days when I really don't want to do a full  face wash at the sink. Bonus - it also removes  dye stains from my skin when I use semi permanent color!\n\nIt's a great value also, I use a cotton pad to wipe this over my skin and really don't need much to clean my face so a big bottle lasts me quite a while with daily use.",

This means my skin is sensitive, reaction/blemish prone and needs several-step skin care and products. But I HAVE to selective with what I use. I never tried micellar water because I use cleanser, makeup wipes and ph-balancing toner so I didn't feel I need this. Well, consider me swayed. Bioderma is gentle, did not cause my fave to inflame in anyway and cleaned remaining dirt and residue that remained even after cleansing and using a makeup wipe. I would certainly add Bioderma to my routine. Gentle and works!",
