        "comments": "2 weeks of owning this dryer the medium setting stopped working all together. The diffuser dose NOT and will NOT stay on no matter how hard I pushed down on it, I had to rubberband the diffiuser on and only use  the hotter setting until I purchased different brand hair dryer. Not only is it  absurd, obnoxious, wasteful of time, money and the environment due to shipping wastes it is down right a rip off, cheap and a total design fail to have any dryer on the market that does have a diffuser that screws on and locks.Everybody knows attaching these ridiclously large tools to a hair dryer makes the dryers nozzle end off balance and top heavy if the the tools,like in thes case a diffuser, only slide on and it was what, not clicking onto to something it will slide off. By now it is ovious companies know this design flaw and have not improved it, if not then they are not testing their product or testing them and cheating us. Corperations are, like BabyBliss, are creating products that have attachments that flawd and since this diffiuser isnt fitting with another dryer it is now landfill, unaccpetable. The technology and ablilty is there to put threads on a dryer nozzle to  screw on a diffuser to the nozzle end of dryer their just cheap and are captializing on us.",

        "comments": "I love that this blowdryer is lightweight and has great dryiing power.   It works great on my thick, coarse, wavy hair.  The reason I didn't give it five stars is because of a couple of design flaws.  The first one isn't a big deal and just takes some getting used to.  The switch on the dryer is in reverse to all other dryers I have owned.  To turn on or increase power, you press down as opposed to up.  Again not a deal breaker.  The second one is a bit more of a deal though.  The diffuser attachment doesn't lock on like most blowdryers.  It simply just slides on,which as you guessed it, causes it to fall off often.  I hope they fix this on future models.  Otherwise is overall a good blow dryer.",

        "comments": "This was the third hair dryer I tried, and frankly, I was getting a bit discouraged that I would ever find one that checked all the boxes for what I was looking for.  But the third time was the charm, when I brought this home!  It dries my hair quickly (but doesn't leave it looking dried out), doesn't blow my hair all over, leaving it a tangled mess, and seems to leave it looking smooth and polished!  It directs the air flow nicely (even without using the concentrator), and the choices of fan speeds and temperatures gives you a nice range for exactly what you need  (including the added cool shot)!  It has a really long cord (well, longer than some of the driers I tried), so you have freedom to move, twist, twirl (you get the idea) - you're not tethered to the electrical outlet on a short cord and not able to move.\nI've only had this a few weeks, but I've used it enough to know that I love it!",

Well, that was my long-held theory for many years...until I purchased this dryer. I tried to give myself the same blow-out as my skilled stylist: I used the exact same products and even the same round brush! Alas, my long, thick coarse hair ALWAYS frizzed, no matter what. It dawned on me that the only difference was the hair dryer. I began an in-depth investigation of hair dryers and quickly learned that most of the top-rated dryers exceeded my monthly car loan payment. Uh, no, I don't think so. But was I willing to spend just a little more than normal on the chance that I could eliminate dryer frizz? Absolutely! Based on positive reviews, the reasonable price, and a coupon, I took a chance on the BaByliss Nano Titanium dryer. Much to my surprise, it actually made a difference! My hair dries much faster with less frizz at the highest settings (not completely frizz-free, mind you, but any reduction is greatly appreciated). The dryer weighs substantially less than my old Revlon, and I am able to completely dry my hair without working up a sweat (a boon to any gal approaching or experiencing menopause!). It has a variety of settings, so I think it's possible to decrease the frizz even more by using the low heat/low speed setting if one has the time. Overall, I'm impressed with what this dryer has done for my hair so far and would recommend it to anyone looking to reduce the frizzies without draining their bank account.",

The problem is my hair looks awful after it's dried. The heat is so low and the air is so forceful that my hair is blown all over the place, and it blows right off the round brush. And the buttons are placed right where you hold the handle. They are flip on and off (not slide up and down). So every time I move my hand (which is a lot because I'm trying to control the ridiculous wind tunnel this thing creates), I accidentally change the airflow, heat setting or shut the thing off altogether. For the price, I was expecting to be wowed. I've had $15 blow dryers that were designed better than this.",
