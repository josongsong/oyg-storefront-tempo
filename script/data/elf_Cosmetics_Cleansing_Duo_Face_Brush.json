        "comments": "I love this brush but would love it even more if the soft sided end with bristles were a little bit more stiffer or rougher. To add to that, it would make it even more better if it was motorized via charging it or battery opperated. This is not a bad brush for its price and the rubber sidded side is awesome for getting dead skin off and exfoliating. I feel as if you used a foam cleanser the soft sidded bristle would be really good at foaming it up and applying it evenly over the face or even a face mask.",

        "comments": "This is a great cleansing brush for all skin types. It is gentle enough for the most sensitive skin, but still provides a deep clean because of the amount of packed bristles. I think others that are used to a more stiff brush head may not like it at first, but I would reccomend sticking with it to see the results. The very gentle exfoliation that occurs is great for skin without damaging it, and really cleans deep. I was skeptical at first as I was used to the clarisonic brush heads and this is very different but my skin has never been better. this brush has lasted me about 2 years and I will be repurchasing. P.s. I clean this brush about every week with diluted cleaning solution (which I reccomend for all face brushes to avoid mildew/bacteria)",

The only useful thing about this brush is the blue side for exfoliating.",

Since I have extremely oily skin that tends to get a gritty feel and look by the end of the day, I go for facial brushes instead of just my hands or a wash cloth. I use the Vanity Planet spin for perfect skin brush and I love it but I wanted a manual substitute that I could take when I traveled. Firstly, the bristle side (white side) is way too soft, like hair almost, and when you start buffing your skin it basically collapses to one side or the other. Secondly, the silicon side doesn't have bristles per say it's more like very tiny spikes which yield minimal to no lather at all! This brush may be more idle for the extremely sensitive skin types but people with oily or normal skin may want to look elsewhere. The brush does have a nice size, nice handle for gripping, and feels like it would last a good amount of time but its just not the one for me.",
