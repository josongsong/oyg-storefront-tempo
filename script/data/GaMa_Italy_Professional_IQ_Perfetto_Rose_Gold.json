I only used the blow dryer, maybe half-dozen times, because I usually let my hair air-dry. I was told this has been a problem with this blow dryer, but neither Ulta or IQ Perfetto would replace it. Very disappointed. I sent it to a gentleman for repair which cost me another $70 for repair and s/h.  The cord is also bulky and heavy.",

However, during the past few months, it has taken about 15 seconds or longer to heat up. There were several times when I was working that it just didn't turn on. The screw cap on the end falls off easily- I am lucky I didn't lose any parts. Lastly, the worst part is that the warranty is 12 months. And it stopped working at officially 13 months so I'm unable to return/exchange it. Do not purchase!! Money is better spent on a higher quality built dryer!!",

        "comments": "I purchased this hairdryer in September 2024. In the interest of full disclosure, it was on sale, and I used my points. I do love this dryer. The power is beyond any dryer I've used, it's almost too much! I do not find it that much quieter than your average hair dryer though. It does dry hair quicker, especially if you leave it on the high speed/heat setting. And my hair looks phenomenal. Very shiny and full! I do have my issues. The first is that the concentrators do not stay on well, at least the larger one. It tends to go flying off while using. Second, like other people said, is the HUGE, BULKY CORD! For such a petite dryer, it's kind of ridiculous! But my worst complaint is that the setting lights for the speed no longer come on at all. Luckily you can easily hear what speed setting it's on, but for such an expensive dryer that's less than 6 months old, I'm disappointed. Overall, I would recommend it, but the quality for such a pricey item could be improved.",

The only issues I had was in the hotel it just stops working when it overheats. I have thick long hair. I blow dry half my hair then do my makeup & blow dry the remaining wet hair. Other than that I like that its not clunky and fits in my suitcase. Its better than a hotel blow dryer. I wish I would've purchased the Shark brand alternative instead.",

I have struggled to dry my hair with 3 different dryers since having shoulder replacements, and this is the first time that I can dry my hair without pain.  It is also so much quieter than others.  So far, it works great.  I have yet to use the high heat or fan settings because the heat on the lowest setting with my short pixie haircut is very hot.  Likewise, I only use the first 2 fan settings as I don't have thick or long hair, and have no need to blow dry for long.  I think this dryer has also added volume and body to my style, which is a blessing.",

Everything is done very cool, the materials are absolutely pleasant to the touch. The hair dryer itself is covered with a protective transparent film.  This hair dryer captivated me with its design and weight! The hand does not get tired at all, which is a huge plus, especially for those with long hair.\nThe hairdryer didn't dry out my hair at all and didn't fluff it up. With it, my hair became well-groomed and manageable (even the girl who cuts the hair was surprised how the hair structure changed for the better, while I didn't change the care). A separate topic is its noise, because there is practically none. He's very quiet. and I noticed that my hair actually stays clean longer and gets less dirty!! The conclusion is this: HAIRDRYER IS GORGEOUS! I'm happy!!  😃",

However, during the past few months, it has taken about 15 seconds or longer to heat up. There were several times when I was working that it just didn't turn on. The screw cap on the end falls off easily- I am lucky I didn't lose any parts. Lastly, the worst part is that the warranty is 12 months. And it stopped working at officially 13 months so I'm unable to return/exchange it. Do not purchase!! Money is better spent on a higher quality built dryer!!",
