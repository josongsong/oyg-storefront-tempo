I have seasonal outdoor springtime allergies which can cause my skin to flare up in hives even while taking antihistamines. Treating hives like acne doesn't work because it's not the same and the products for acne treatment can further irritate the hives. This facial spray got rid of my hives overnight when I wore it to bed!! It's gentle, soothing, and fragrance free which is great for sensitive skin. Highly recommend.",

I spray it on my face , my pillow before i go to bed and as well as my phone. And I'm telling you right now my acne has been getting better and just in a week.

When I found this already low-cost version on sale, I figured I'd give it a shot. \n\nI am BLOWN AWAY by how good this has been for my skin. Ex.: No matter how careful I am about sanitizing my tools, I keep getting tiny zits/bumps whenever I pluck my brows. I tried this spray and the bumps were gone within a few hours! My skin is softer/smoother, and the bit of redness I sometimes have is gone. \n\nThis is going to be a mainstay in my routine going forward.",
