There is NO other gloss that will give you such a glass look to your lips! I do wish MAC would come out with jelly colors of these. I do wish it had a slight vanilla scent like all their other lippies. This is a staple in my gloss collection!",

My ONLY problem with it is that it leaks a bit when you open it, so its a bit hard to control the amount on your lips. It is also a bit pricey but this will last you a while. It is by far the glossiest lip product i have ever used, and doesnt dry out my lips!",

This really makes the gloss last a while on the lips though. The gloss doesn't have a smell nor taste to it either. Honestly my lips don't feel more moisturized or soft after using it. But my lips do look very pretty and shiny when wearing. I would say this gloss is mostly for looks and their are much cheaper alternatives.",

I won't say it doesn't deliver on shine, because it does. but it's unbelievably sticky and heavy. feels like wearing goop on your lips. will string together when you open your mouth. hair gets stuck in it 24/7. applicator just doesn't work because it's so sticky. works as an eyegloss, but that's it. I recommend the essence lipgloss instead.",

When I put this over my matte lipstick it makes it look 100x better; my lips no longer look dry and shriveled and instead look like something out of a makeup catalog! In the beginning the gloss is extremely glossy and shiny but as time goes on it looks less like glass and more like a sheen. Still extremely nice! \n\nHowever, the lipgloss is very thick and sticky. That is, when my lips are closed and I open them, you see the gloss pull apart. After a little while, the gloss amount reduces and is ultimately much dryer but has a sheen to it. This is when it looks best in my opinion.\nA bit later, the gloss really starts to come off and takes the lipstick off with it. At this point, your lips feel moderately sticky and there is little shine to them.\nI took off a star because of the aforementioned problems, however on the overall it gets the job done which is why it earns 4 stars! \n\nHighly recommend this product for anyone who wants to wear it over matte lipstick! The shape of the gloss makes it easy to put the gloss on over lipstick and you don't have to worry about a brush getting stained!",

I'm not a fan of these types of containers for that very reason, but decided to try it because I needed a clear lip gloss and I know MAC has awesome products.  Disappointed that I ended up throwing it away before I even got to use 1/4 of it.  I would prefer if it came in a regular lip gloss container with a brush or sponge applicator.",
