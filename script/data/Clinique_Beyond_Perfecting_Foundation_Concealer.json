        "headline": "I used this for 7 years",
        "comments": "I used this product for 7 years. My skin has changed throughout the years. I used to have combo skin and now I have oily skin. I have always had dehydrated looking skin. This product has great coverage and it is the only foundation I found at the time of initial purchase. That was my exact color match being pale with neutral undertones it was hard to find a foundation that wasn't yellow or pink entirely For the color selection. I would say it gets a 10 out of 10 however I will say that since my initial purchase, I was always under the impression that this was a dewy finish. I was extremely surprised to find out after purchasing it a couple times that it is actually supposed to be a soft matte finish. It absolutely is not a soft matte finish. This is an extremely greasy or dewy finish. For me that was not a problem as I don't like looking extremely matte. When my skin was combo, I would find that I could set this foundation a lot better with powder however I would still have breakthrough oils. After only maybe two or three hours it would make for mainly an all day where but I could absolutely not touch my face as it would transfer Since becoming more oily. I had a hard time letting go of this product just because of the color match, but it became a nuisance when I couldn't touch my face at all, and it started to feel really heavy on my face… powder wouldn't really set it, and I would feel like it would just make it feel thicker on my Face And powder would actually make it break apart even more. Ultimately, I recently made the switch to a different product as I know that a lot of other lines are more inclusive with their shades now so I did find a color match and another brand the applicator on this as well I think contributed to my acne since you do have have to touch it to a surface and it is not a pump. Additionally, there is a piece in the cap attached to the applicator that comes off and gets stuck inside the bottle and this has happened for years. It's easy enough to remove or put back in place but it is something I've come to expect with this foundation I don't see myself going back to this foundation after trying different brands, but I think it's worth it to say that I was loyal to it for a long time and maybe if you have dry skin this would be the perfect foundation for you.",

I have acne prone skin, so I was looking for something with full coverage that was non comedogenic.  Previously, I was using Estee Laudre Double Wear.  Just wanted to try something different.  \nI couldn't believe how the makeup transferred with just the slightest touch.  It also felt very heavy and just felt like it sat on my face.  \nI ended up going back to Estee Laudre Doudle Wear.",

I've tried numerous applications and blending techniques and it matter which technique I used it still left streaks or blothes. I use a blurring lines and primer and the foundation still would settle in my pores and didn't give a smooth finish. I came off easily even with a setting powder. Touch on the nose or cheek or jawline and I would have to touch up or reapply in that area. I have used Clinique foundations before trying this one and didn't have a problem. Clinique seems to be phasing out the previous foundation I have used and adding more foundations with sunscreen (which I can't use) in them.",

I don't like wearing foundation (bought this thinking it was just concealer haha) but if I did, this would be a good option for me. It just felt too heavy for my preference but this is probably because I only wear tined sunscreen and concealer. I wore it a few times before returning it thinking I could get used to the way it felt but it just isn't for me. It covered my Melasma patches and dark circles though! Probably better for those who want a full coverage foundation. Didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't use it enough to really see if I had any other issues with it. It seemed to last long but did look somewhat heavy, probably because I'm just not used to wearing that much makeup.",

        "comments": "I purchased Golden Neutral, and at first I thought it seemed very dark. I put a puddle on my hand and then applied with a sponge. That's not the way to do it with this foundation. The applicator in the bottle can be used to dab on hands or face, and then this can be blended with a sponge or fingers. A dot of it does wonders. My regular amount of foundation is way, way too much. After a couple of days of playing around with this, I realize I need less to cover my whole face than I ever could have imagined. This is, by far, the most highly concentrated foundation I've ever used. I tend to go for \"sheer\" foundations that can be built up to medium coverage, so I'm not used to such a tiny amount having such true coverage. Beyond Perfecting is something I \"dot\" on my face...1-2 dots does my WHOLE face. It is a fabulous concealer for spots, discolorations, redness, and large pores. It takes a couple of minutes to \"set\", and it looks pretty heavy at first. However, I notice when it sets it seems to disappear, and my skin looks flawless. Golden Neutral is actually the perfect color for me once this adjusts itself and sets. I really enjoy the super light, silky feel of this and I love the matte, extremely long-lasting finish. This may just top Superbalanced as my favorite foundation, and that's saying a lot! I really like Beyond Perfecting's large concealer wand for application. Other serum foundations with droppers are such a mess. This stays neat and clean and it makes application a breeze. The texture of this is unique...there's nothing else like it. Great buy! I am so glad Clinique makes fragrance-free products for sensitive skin. They keep me feeling pretty.",

        "comments": "I was very excited about this foundation when told to me by my regular SA late last year. When another makeup store offered it early, I jumped at the chance to try it. Knowing that some foundations are not consistent in the color due to formulation, I ordered two that I believed to be closest to - Amber and Golden. In most Clinique foundations, I am matched to Amber since Spice is only offered in the Stay Matte (I am more neutral in my undertones) but they tend to be just a shade dark so I tried the Amber in this one first. The color intensity was right but very, very orange. That was just in one swipe and so orange I did not bother to complete a full face and was discouraged to try the other shade. A few days later, I tried the Golden, much better but just too light and it is very obvious. I did complete a full face and felt that the foundation was weightless and it did have a mattifying finish to it, almost flat-like where you would have to add blush, highlighting or whatever to add definition back to your face. Therefore, I would not call it skin-like like some of the newer foundations on the marketing are advertising and would not recommend for a quick 5-minute face. I even went in store for a SA to color match and again, the match was not to be found. I would recommend the foundation for those who can find their color match and like a medium to full coverage and don't mind the extra time to add definition to your face with contouring, etc.",
