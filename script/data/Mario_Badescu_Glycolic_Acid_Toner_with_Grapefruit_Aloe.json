I have acne prone, dry skin and before I started using this I was using 2.5% benzoyl peroxide which did wonders for my skin! Well I decided to skip my benzoyl peroxide one night (used toner in the morning and peroxide at night) and I expected my skin to be covered in pimples the next morning, but my skin was so clear. So I started skipping it more and more and only using the toner along with my cleaner, hylauranic acid, and moisturizer and my skin is still clear! I never knew anything else would work fr my skin, but I'm glad this does. Plus it smells great and keeps my skin looking glowy.",

This toner, however, burned my skin.  I used it for about 2 weeks thinking that maybe I just needed to give it some time.  The skin around my nose actually became hard, flaky and red.  It looked and felt like a terrible sunburn.  Eventually that look spread around more areas of my face.  The glycolic acid in this toner is too potent!!!  I do not have particularly sensitive skin, so this surprised me.  My face was so painful and continued to burn for hours after use.  After I quit using it, my skin returned to normal.  I use the Alpha-Grapefruit cleansing lotion now and I absolutely LOVE it!!!",
