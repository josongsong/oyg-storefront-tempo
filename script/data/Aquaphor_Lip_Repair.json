It's hydrating, with a slight glossy shine and has so many great protective and reparative agents. It's made for your lips, but it can also be used to hydrate eyelids and under-eyes if needed.",

Sure it goes on nice and feels nice when it's on but does nothing for my lips long-term and there is absolutely nothing special about it. I could lose it and forget I ever had it unlike my chapstick medicated or Kapari lip. Again it's Mid, not bad, not overly good. Very forgettable.",

No matter what I used or how often I reapplied it wasn't healing. It was miserable. I bought a tube of Aquaphor lip repair & now I won't be buying anything else. It's not greasy or sticky, and lasts for a long time after applying. It healed my cracked lip in a couple of days. My lips haven't felt this hydrated in forever. It's kinda on the pricey side, but it truly works, so to me it's worth it.",

All other chapsticks dry out my lips as soon as I stop using them, causing me to become dependent on them. I was so excited when Aquaphor came out with a lip ointment that is small and fits conveniently in my purse. I bought 4 of them! I have been so disappointed though... They must have changed the ingredients because it is not the same as the original ointment! The lip balm has actually made my lips remarkably more chapped every time I use it. The only thing I can figure out is that it must not be the same as the original Aquaphor ointment that has NEVER done that to my lips before. I really wish they would have kept the same formula for the lip repair as they have for their original ointment. Very disappointing.",
