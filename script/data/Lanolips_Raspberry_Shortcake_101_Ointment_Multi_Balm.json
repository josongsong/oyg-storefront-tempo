While I did find the applicator a bit messy, the product went far beyond my expectations. It applied smoothly and had a thick formula that immediatley hydrated my lips. It also smells absolutely fabulous. I would reccomend Lanolips to anybody and everybody and I can't wait to buy every scent/flavor.",

I wear it all day! Both the 101 Multibalm and the lip treatments they have are amazing—the lip treatment products are just a little more spreadable. I use the Lemonade lip treatment mostly at night, let it sink in, and then put the Lawless forget the filler lip mask over it—so amazing! The multibalm is thick but not sticky, and lasts forever. Makes my lips look hydrated and smooth. I recommend exfoliating lips and then putting it on in AM. I also put lip gloss over it (the 101 multibalm) and it all lasts for hours! I am a huge fan, and I've never found a lip product I love like this.",

I'm not sure if I got a bad batch because it has so many good reviews on here but it's super thin and barely lasts, the other ointments last all day long and are super thick! I would recommend sticking with the other flavors.",
