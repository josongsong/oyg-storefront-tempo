The formula has been changed ( and no longer has sunscreen ) and does not go on or stay on the way the old formula did. The shade Shell was originally replaced with a drugstore orange shade, but they keep testing new shades. All of them horrible. When they first changed the formula and dropped this very popular shade, the reviews were terrible. It went from a 5 Star product and kept dropping. It seems like the Review counter has been reset. It appears to me that Estee is starting over with new reviews by consumers who aren't familiar with how good the OLD formula was so they have no idea how awful this formula is compared to that. I had been a very loyal Estee customer. All my makeup and skincare products were Estee. BTW Double Wear Foundation in the original Shell shade is still available in Great Britain and can be ordered from better online British retailers.Now Estee has dropped Lucidity loose powder and many customers are trying to use Double Wear powder foundation as a replacement. Don't waste your money. It works nothing like Lucidity powder.The Lucidity pressed powder doesn't work like the loose powder did either.",
