        "comments": "First- the 12 hour claim is dubious at best. I tried using their setting powder as recommended on instagram but with minimal success. Don't expect to be able to eat or drink without some of it coming off. It's a high bar, but one that I'm looking for in a long wear lip color.  That being said I like the fact that it isn't sticky which makes it far preferable to the urban decay product I was using before. \nSecond: the range of colors needs to be expanded- I find many of the light/mid toned colors to have an orange-ish base. Rhyme was the closest thing that worked on me but would prefer some cooler hues that aren't super dark. I recommend looking/trying at the store before buying- I ended up having to return one that I took a chance on.\nThird: while I like the idea of liner and color together I think it doesn't function well as a liner. It may be too soft, I don't know. I'd prefer a separate pencil if it would hold better.",

It doesn't last long for me, definitely need to reapply after eating or drinking or just living life, but I'm ok with that. If you're not then pass, but the color and application are a winner for me.",

        "comments": "It's been awhile since I have gotten a crayon-styled lip product and for some reason, this was calling my name, probably due to the simple yet pretty packaging. The formula itself was easy to work with. The tip of the crayon is sharp enough to line the lips while I used the side as a allover lip color. The formula is soft and isn't drying on my dry lips. It stays on like a normal lipstick so don't expect a long-lasting formula. What I love the most about this product is the color, Earthen. It's a semi-brick red color and it is lovely as a lip liner and also as a lip color. Very happy with this!",

        "comments": "My sister sent me an Ilia product that I liked a lot so I recently ordered the Lip Sketch Hydrating Crayon they've been pumping on Instagram. I ordered a pencil in Case Study, a true red and was excited when my package arrived today. Not only didn't I get the product I ordered, but they sent me two pencils in totally unrelated colors and a sharpener I didn't order. I was also missing the one sample I requested and really cared about as I was interested in ordering a full size of that product. I'm disappointed in the quality control on the fulfillment end. It is like they just grabbed stuff and shoved it into a box. Now I have to deal with returns and another wait for the product I actually wanted. This is a quality product and I know they have had great success from all the Instagram exposure. But be careful what you wish for. With the hype and success, the company had better be prepared for the volume of orders and the procedures to ensure accurate shipping of those orders.",
