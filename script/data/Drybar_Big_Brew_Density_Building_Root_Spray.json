This was a great volumizer product as usual Drybar absolutely kills it in the scent department, it's nice not having to worry about getting a headache from a chemical scent. This is an interesting product in comparison to the old big brew which was more of a paste consistency in a tube. That worked better as a mix between hair gel and mousse wheras this seems really similar to southern belle, less fluffy obviously and more of a hairspray. Personally I like it a lot either way but as someone with very straight hair, I do miss the unique consistency and root hold of the original formula and it's a bit harder to be precise with a spray than squeezing a bit on your fingers and applying on the roots or crown especially for a pompadour look. Definitely worth it at the end of the day as a replacement since I assume they've discontinued the other type!",
