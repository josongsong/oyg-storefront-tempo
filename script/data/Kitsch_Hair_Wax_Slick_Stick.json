I had to put it on top of another bottle and push the wax tube down over the other bottle as extra leverage to push the wax out.\n\nWhile applying, little pieces of wax get left behind that look like dandruff. These were easily brushed out, but some of the finer pieces look like dandruff.\n\nIt… works. My hair looks greasy, and after 4 hours I have a few flyaways. Its not crunchy or sticky on my hair.",

        "comments": "I love my hair wax stick from Kit.sch because I have ornery hair. I also have multiple \"COWLICKS \" that are very stubborn and have a mind of their own. Since 2019 my mostly white hair became in terrible condition. It was long and scraggily and breaking off… it was in pretty bad shape. On top of this my hair has always grown downwards toward my face. It was a mess and sort of depressing. I got a bob which was a start. I kept using the same shampoos and conditioner so my hair did not get any better. I ordered some shampoo and conditioners from \"Kit.sch\" and got my hair cute short the next day. The interesting thing is I think I shopped and ordered late at night and I propbably should have ordered the products with bioten in them but in error did not. I have been so amazed that my part lines are filling in. I no longer have wads of hair to pick up after a shampoo. The hair wax stick helps me ease my wonky cowlick hair back where I want it every morning after I get up. This product works very well for my needs. I think it being in a stick for makes it easy for me to apply. Eventually I will try the products for white/gray hair.",

        "comments": "I thought this would be a great substitute for hair spray.  Not for me!  First of all, I had a difficult time pushing the wax stick up so I could use it.  Then, when I finally managed to get it pushed up (using more than just my fingers), it seemed too soft, and left a trail of white wax in my hair.  So, I refrigerated it for 2 days and tried it again.  Same problem!  And I have light-colored hair, but I still had to work it into the hair so that it wouldn't show.  Frankly, I do not understand all the rave reviews about this product.",
