This blush lasts YEARS of DAILY wear. It's actually a better value than drugstore blushes that run out much faster. The shades are also much more nuanced than generic bubblegum pink. I have jet black hair, blue eyes and pale skin. Fleur power looks perfect with my complexion and pairs beautifully with any lipstick I wear, especially MAC Kinda Sexy.",

        "comments": "I use MAC foundation (Matchmaster) daily -- after realizing how amazing these products are, I added MAC Powder Blush in Springsheen & Longwear Bronzing Powder in Sun Dipped. My skin reacted terribly and I had breakouts throughout the areas I used only these products (cheeks and along jawline for contouring). Wish they both would have worked, as both were great products & had great color, they just didn't work for my skin type. Mac, please reconsider your ingredients for these products, I'd love to use them!",
