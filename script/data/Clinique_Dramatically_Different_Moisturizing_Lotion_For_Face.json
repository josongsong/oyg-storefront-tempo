I've been using this lotion for years and never had them without Clinique packaging when I ordered from Clinique. I went to a local store to request an exchange, and they said jumbo size does not come in boxes. However, I clearly remember that when I ordered a jumbo size from other stores including Clinique, I received it sealed and packaged in a box. This is my first time ordering through Ulta and I'm hugely disappointed.",

I have tried store brand moisturizers of many kinds and my face still would be dry in the morning. And as I age my face seemed to be getting more and more dry. I saw reviews of this new and improved version of their signature moisturizer and decided I would give it a try. It's fabulous! I don't wake up in the morning with the dry flakiness I had grown accustom to! My face is moist, not oily. It absorbs quickly without a filmy residue. Perfect for the middle aged woman in need of a serious moisturizer that works!",

I have never had any complaints and/or concerns about the outcome of my skin using DDML, but sad to say that has changed. I tried the DDML+ for the first time, and I felt like I had used Vasoline instead of DDLM (in fact, that is why I started using DDLM in the first place several decades ago, for it didn't have the feel of a greasy product on my face). I will be buying, or in other words stocking-up, a couple of bottles of the original DDLM and hope that Clinique minuses the plus out of the Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion by the time my last bottle is empty....so Clinique please minus the plus out of Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion (or provide both products so Clinique loyal customers can choose the lotion that fits them best.)",
