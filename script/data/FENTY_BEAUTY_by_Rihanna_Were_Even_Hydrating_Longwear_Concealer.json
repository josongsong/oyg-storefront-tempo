It's perfect for daytime activities like breakfast, going to the gym, or running errands. If you're looking for something with full coverage for a night out, you might need a heavier formula, but for everyday wear, this is fantastic.\n\nThe only downside is the price—it's a bit on the higher side, and you could find heavier coverage options in the same range. That said, the color range is wide, it's hydrating, and overall, I've had a very positive experience with Fenty products. I'd definitely use it again!",

        "comments": "I'm extremely picky with concealers because of my combination skin. This one works just as well under the eyes as it does on spots. The shade range is amazing too, I'm thinking about getting another shade to better match the rest of my face, as I primarily use it under my eyes. \n\nIt says it's a hydrating formula, to which I would say it's just not drying like other concealers can be. It layers very well over itself and can be built up to full coverage, although one layer will do you just fine with the right tools and prep. It wears comfortably and by the end of the day, it's still on somehow!",

It's not crease proof, which is fine because nothing truly is. It also doesn't look dry and cakey as I've experienced with the Haus Labs and Hourglass concealers. I use shade 175w. If you're my shade twin I use the Fenty matte foundation in 185, about-face foundation in L2neutral, Too Faced born this way foundation in Warm Nude, Haus Labs concealer shade 11 and foundation shade 100, and the Hourglass concealer in Silk.",

I've tried blending with brush vs finger, setting with powder, etc.  I don't wear primer but recently bought some, so I'm curious if that'll help.  Undereye is really the only place I experience this, and it covers everything else really nicely and lasts well.",

Its a super dry and unfortunately I have dry undereyes that love to absorb product. \n\nAfter hydrating my face, and using the Ulta Brand settinf spray, I was able to hydrate it to get it to work and to get the look I was expecting from it. \n\nI don't think I will be repurchasing this product, because I feel like I get the same coverage from the NYX new stick color corectors and concealers- and they're more budget friendly. I was really hoping this was going to do wonders, but it really lacked for me.\n\nDo not purchase if you have dry skin.",
