I was hoping this product might help with that based on reviews. This made no difference to my hair in any way, other than making my scalp get greasy slightly faster if used on the scalp area. It felt like a conditioner on my hair, but didn't leave it feeling particularly moisturized, and didn't seem to make any difference at all to what my hair looked like once dry. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it didn't actually damage my hair or anything.",

After just one use, my strands felt noticeably smoother and looked so much shinier without feeling weighed down. What I love most is that it doesn't leave a greasy residue—just a silky, salon-fresh finish.\n\nThe application was super easy, and the results have been long-lasting. My hair feels healthier, more hydrated, and less prone to frizz. If you're struggling with dryness and want a product that delivers instant and noticeable results, I highly recommend this gloss! It's become a staple in my hair care routine.",

I'm big on how a product smells. It can be an amazing product but if the smell isn't pleasing to me, I'll sadly stop using it. I'm happy to say the smell of this is so clean and I love it. It's not fruity or flowery smelling. It reminds me of when you leave the salon and your hair smells clean and fresh. \n\nNow onto the product itself. It's simple to use and rinse out. It's not greasy or oily but feels more like a conditioner. I used my normal styling products afterwards and styled my hair like usual. I do notice a shine to my hair with this. It's similar to when you're under the lights and your hair shimmers. My hair just has this shine to it instead of the dull look. \n\nI don't wash my hair daily so day two was my test with this. I don't typically reapply any products on day two. I just curl my hair in loose curls and finger comb them out.  My hair was just as shiny and beautiful as day one. It didn't look greasy either. I highly recommend this product.",

        "comments": "I have fine, thin, wavy hair, and am always on the lookout for something that can tame flyaways on top of my head without weighing it down or making it look greasy. I was hoping this product might help with that based on reviews. This made no difference to my hair in any way, other than making my scalp get greasy slightly faster if used on the scalp area. It felt like a conditioner on my hair, but didn't leave it feeling particularly moisturized, and didn't seem to make any difference at all to what my hair looked like once dry. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it didn't actually damage my hair or anything.",
