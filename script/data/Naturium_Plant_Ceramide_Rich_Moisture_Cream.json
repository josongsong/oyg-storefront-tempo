I do like this product & definitely recommend it.\nI didn't care for the Tranexemic Acid (did next to nothing for my mylasma & dark spots, nor did I like the Vitamin C product). That said, they may work better for some people. Just didn't do anything for me.",

The texture was more like a balm rather than a cream, making it feel more emollient rather than hydrating. This product is also marketed as fragrance free, however, it had a eucalyptus-like scent. Overall, I think there are better thick moisturizers out there.",

I have combo skin that can be oily but using this as my night cream is amazing. No scent, no irritation or breakouts and no oiliness the next morning. Perfect for after retinol or exfoliating",

So I'm here to be honest. \n\nIf you have acne issues even a little, do not use. \n\nI do not have acne prone skin and this broke me out every night that I put it on. I woke up to a new spot. It is slightly greasy and just a little tuff to rub around skin because it is thicker than most moisturizers. It also has a really unpleasant smell like rubber tires. The smell lasts for a couple hours. 2 stars because it is very hydrating but that's if you are willing to trade that for acne and the unpleasant smell",
