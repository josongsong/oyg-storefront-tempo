It's rough out here lol, especially with darker, sensitive skin bc so much just isn't formulated to work as well for us, whether you're consistent or not.\n\nBut this? Unicorns are real, y'all. I use it with the rest of the Mela B3 line, but this cleanser is a standout on its own. Yk how sometimes you wipe toner over your face and dead skin gets on the cotton pad? NOT ANYMORE. It's fading dark spots I though were gonna outlive me, and I haven't even been using it all everyday. I'm glowing after just CLEANSER, and I don't have to put up with tight skin for it! T•T And it plays well with my other products, too!\n\nI bought the whole B3 line on impulse and am keeping everything. Prepare to be SICKA ME!! More and more brands are remembering us black and brown skin girlies while they cook in the lab. And La Roche-Posay has gone above and beyond with cute, purple packaging to match.\n\nStuff like this makes it easier for people like me to maintain and genuinely get excited about self care. I never would've thought this is how good things could get.",

        "comments": "I bought this cleanser as a substitute for the serum version as it was more affordable and somehow the cleanser managed to not only lighten my dark spots but my face overall. I have never seen my face this cleared up from acne and I have extremely stubborn skin. The biggest concern I have about this product is that its super drying. It has dried my face to the extent where some parts experience peeling/flaking. Due to this, I had to use extra moisturizer or hydrating products as the product can cause redness as well. A little goes a long way, make sure not to use too much otherwise your skin will be harmed rather than healed.",

As soon as I quit using these products, my skin rapidly healed. I have used niacinamide before but not at this high of concentration. Not sure if it's that or some other ingredient that aggravated my skin. It did not reduce my skin sebum at all nor help with mild melasama, but it did somewhat help reduce other hyperpigmentation and surface redness. It cleaned the skin well without drying it, so I liked it at first and had high hopes. Obviously not a product for me though.",

        "comments": "The Mela-B3 Gel Cleanser has a lightweight gel texture that feels refreshing on the skin. It lathers up nicely and effectively removes dirt, oil, and impurities without leaving the skin feeling stripped or dry. I appreciate that it thoroughly cleanses the skin without causing any irritation or redness.\n\nOne of the standout features of this cleanser is its powerful blend of active ingredients. It contains Vitamin B3 (niacinamide), Vitamin C, and salicylic acid, which work together to brighten the skin, fade dark spots, and promote a more even complexion. These ingredients are known for their skin-brightening and exfoliating properties, making the Mela-B3 Gel Cleanser an excellent choice for those struggling with hyperpigmentation.\n\nAfter using the cleanser for a few weeks, I noticed a visible improvement in my skin's tone and texture. My dark spots started to fade, and my skin appeared more radiant and even. Additionally, the cleanser helped to unclog my pores and minimize the appearance of blemishes, leaving my skin looking clearer and healthier.\n\nI also appreciate that the Mela-B3 Gel Cleanser is suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin. La Roche-Posay is known for its gentle and dermatologist-tested formulations, and this cleanser is no exception. It is free from harsh irritants and is non-comedogenic, meaning it won't clog pores or cause breakouts.\n\nAnother great aspect of this cleanser is its refreshing scent. It has a light and pleasant fragrance that adds to the overall sensory experience of using the product.\n\nIn terms of packaging, the Mela-B3 Gel Cleanser comes in a convenient pump bottle, which makes it easy to dispense the right amount of product. It also helps to keep the cleanser hygienic and prevents any wastage.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the La Roche-Posay Mela-B3 Gel Cleanser for anyone looking to brighten their skin, fade dark spots, and achieve a more even complexion. Its gentle yet effective formula, combined with its refreshing texture and pleasant scent, make it a standout cleanser in the skincare market. Give it a try, and you'll likely see noticeable improvements in your skin's appearance.",

        "comments": "I used this and corresponding melasyl serum daily for approximately 3 weeks before having one of the worst breakouts of my life. My face erupted in cytsic acne. As soon as I quit using these products, my skin rapidly healed. I have used niacinamide before but not at this high of concentration. Not sure if it's that or some other ingredient that aggravated my skin. It did not reduce my skin sebum at all nor help with mild melasama, but it did somewhat help reduce other hyperpigmentation and surface redness. It cleaned the skin well without drying it, so I liked it at first and had high hopes. Obviously not a product for me though.",
