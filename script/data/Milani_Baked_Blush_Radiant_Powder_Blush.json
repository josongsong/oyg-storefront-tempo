Google told me that this blush in Dolce Pink would be a good dupe. the blush is very pretty, but it's not the color I was looking for. it has good pigment and is blendable, but I'm going to order Bella Ballini in hopes it's closer to the color I'm looking for!",

It's gorgeous)- a sophisticated rose with a golden glow and a touch of brown. 05 - Luminoso a beautiful melon/peachy color that works on everyone. This also has great iridescence. 12 Bella Bellini- I love this one. It's pinky-peach with a more opal-like glow. It works beautifully layers over #13 13 Rosa Romantica a lighter glow that is more of a paler pink with gold and lighter shade glow 15 Sunset Passion- a warm rose bronze that is lighter than Rose D'Oro. This one is great on the eyes and can be used as a bronzer as well as a base layer of blush and use 13 Rosa Romantica over it to great the highlights. In the attached photo I have the colors in numerical order from left to right (02-15) I also featured the Baked Bronzer (04 Glow) I have too which is such a great color to wear as blush, bronzer or even eye shadow. The BAKED series is absolutely killer. I am not usually obsessed with one brand and I never buy various colors quickly but these were too good to pass up so when I saw a color I thought would work for me (usually newer ones), I bought it over the last 5-6 months. Each of these blushes and the bronzer go on as sheer washes. I apply with a small kabuki brush and along the cheekbone up to my hairline above my ear. I use the brush to blend it out well and if I need a bit more highlight, I add in another layer of color from a lighter blush.",

I selected Rosa Romantica based on the recommendations. It has no pink in it. It is practically a yellow/orange/gold color with brown streaks going through it. It is not pink at all. The blush itself is great quality, goes on well and does not make me break out, but just not a good color for me.",
