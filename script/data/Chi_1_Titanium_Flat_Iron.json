        "comments": "I was in the market for a new titanium straightener so when I saw this, I decided to try it out since with my 20 percent off coupon. It definitely looks and feels more luxe than the classic Chi. It feels solid and sturdy, but not too heavy. \n\nWhen you first plug it in and turn it on, it's auto-set to 380 degrees and it took me a little while to figure out how to adjust the temperature. I kept pressing the only button, but this just turned it on and off. I finally read the instruction manual and found out that it has a touch-screen for the temperature control, LOL. \n\nIt heats up very quickly and beeps and blinks when it's ready to use. It has a 1-hour auto-shut off feature. \n\nIt straightens my thick, wavy hair with just one pass. However, it doesn't glide through my hair as buttery smooth as I would like and expect from a hair tool at this price point. For comparison, I have a $30 titanium Kipozi straightener that I got from Amazon years ago that glides through my hair more smoothly than this one.\n\nThis does a good job of curling my hair, but unfortunately, my hair does snag on the embossed \"CHI\" lettering. But the curls are beautiful, bouncy and shiny. \n\nOne thing this is lacking is a snap-close and locking feature, which would be more convenient for storing and traveling. \n\nOverall, this is a good product but I am still on the hunt for that perfect titanium flat iron.",
