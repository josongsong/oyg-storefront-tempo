Im still trying to figure out how to incorporate Blueberry Ice into my routine since I can't use it on its own, but with other colors it's not bad. There is a little warm sensation for the plumping but it's not painful. I would definitely recommend!!",

It is just decent. The color is actually very pretty but the formulation is okay. It takes a few swipes to get your desired color and the container is TINY so the value for money really isnt there. I also find it pretty drying and the staying power is about an hour and a half. Thats not super surprising for a glossy formulation but if you have tried hourglass phantom lip balm that is a similar formulation but much better and stays on for hours. Personally wouldnt recommend.",
