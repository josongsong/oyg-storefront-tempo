I also suffer from getting a lot of red bumps and ingrown hairs from shaving my face. (I am a beautiful man BTW) this really helps to smooth out my skin and even calms down my redness. My skin is now fairly normal and on the dry side since coming from accutane but this does not irritate my skin in the slightest and i have super sensitive skin. It makes my skin brighter, pore tighter and give a deeper clean. I'be been using it everyday for the past three weeks and i am in love. There are no more bumps or redness and my pores are smaller! Try it girl it is worth it and it lasts for so long!",

I had high hopes for this product my face felt fabulous I liked the products very much, but on day 15 I came down with contact dermatitis and had to return the whole purchase. I have dry and very very sensitive skin I've never used skin care products on my face ever and I'm 57 years old. In my entire life I've had less than five pimples. In the past I've tried every now and then to adopt a skin care regime but it always ends like this. Because of Clinique' reputation for testing their products I thought this line of skincare would work for me. Despite my problem I would very much recommend this product for a friend because, I think most people can use these products safely",
