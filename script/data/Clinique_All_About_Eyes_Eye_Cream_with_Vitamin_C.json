It's silky and lightweight on skin but whether it worked to eliminate dark under eye shadows or whether I imagined it...I don't know! Regardless, I returned to buy the large jar of this with the impression it'd last me. I haven't read the reviews yet but if anyone else has mentioned how quickly this stuff evaporates..it's true, and not just me! I apply it lightly but by the look of this two and a half week old jar you'd think I was using it as a face cream. I won't be be purchasing it again...it doesn't last long enough for the price",
