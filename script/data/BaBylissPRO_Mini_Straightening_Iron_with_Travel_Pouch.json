I bought the travel size so I can take it in the trailer and have it not take up much room. It works great. My only complaint is; whoever designed the little pouch for it, obviously did not have the actual instrument to design it around because it is too small and needs to be a few inches wider to accommodate the cord and the straighting iron without forcing the cord into a really tight bend which eventually will damage the cord. In the limited amount of space I have in our trailer letting the cord dangle exposes it to damage from other items.",

The heat is so inconsistent that sometimes it's barely on and other times it's so hot you can't hold it. All of the gray plates broke off and the blue paint is chipping. You have to cram it into the travel bag and even then it will hardley close. The godforsaken thing finally broke after about a year. I've never been so happy to throw something away, I will never buy anthing from this company again.",

Full disclosure - I have fine slightly frizzed, cowlick bangs.  I use a GHD straightener normally which gets hot enough to undo my hair's natural wave to stick straight up.  This flat iron got my bangs to flatten out, but it did not last the whole day.  I was not in a humid environment.  So, really it was just the strength of the iron.  Used it two times just to make sure.  Does not replace a real iron, so keep your expectations in check.  Otherwise, it is compact and travel friendly.  I am, however, returning this item as it did not meet my needs.",
