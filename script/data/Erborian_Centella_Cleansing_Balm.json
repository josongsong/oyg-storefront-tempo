It's easy to apply with my fingers or a sponge.     My only gripe is the shade range. The lightest shade, &quot;clair&quot; is a bit too dark on me so I can only apply a very sheer layer or I look orange. I'm sure others will have an issue on the other end of the spectrum as well given that the darkest shade is &quot;caramel&quot;. If this came in a lighter shade I would wear it every day!",
