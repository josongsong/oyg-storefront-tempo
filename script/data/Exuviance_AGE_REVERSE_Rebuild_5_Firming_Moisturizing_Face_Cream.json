I even went back to my old moisturizer and tried to tell myself there was no difference. But I just couldn't lie to myself - there is such a difference when I started using this moisturizer! My fine lines almost disappeared, and do when I am hydrated. My skin is plumper, and glows with a smoother finish. No other moisturizer has given me the results this one has!",

It isn't creamy it feels more like a balm and doesn't rub into the skin, it pills, and it feels like little \"scrubbies\" are in it ... it's so strange. I don't know how to include a picture of it. And some reviews mentioning the smell of it ... this has no fragrance at all. Maybe since it's a small sample size it's old or a bad batch, something like that. But this is no cream.",

I found out later that this brand is designed for 40-50 plus skin types who have already been using advanced skincare formulas for years. Good rule of thumb for my sensitive skin girlies, just because it's expensive does not mean itll work better. Try starting out with the inexpensive basics. Your skin will thank you.",

I exfoliate and use it properly but no matter how long I let it absorb, it starts to pill without even touching it. Little white rolls at the side of my face and on my neck. It's expensive, too. Very disappointed. I was hoping this would be an empty I'd brag about and repurchase, but it's such a problem fhat i can't even wear it at night. The Hydrafirm is even worse. Always gummy and pilling, it didn't even give you a honeymooon period when it was new. Seems like a formula problem.",

For the past month, I have been using it as a before bedtime moisturizer, so in the morning I wake up and my skin is feeling smoother and glowing. Those little fine lines are definitely looking less noticeable. With all the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties along with Vitamin E that helps to smooth the skin and provide moisture, and glycerin, which is a hydrator and adds water to the skin, I am feeling rejuvenated and younger-looking, and people are noticing. It is a whipped, thick rich texture, not at all greasy and smells so sweet. There is a definite improvement in firmness and a lift to my cheeks. I would recommend for anyone who wants to turn back the clock on aging.  It is a definite top of the list addition to my skin routine.",

This feels very nice on the skin with minimal scent but I'm at the end of the jar and won't repurchase. I've noticed basically no change in my skin but that isn't even the main reason that I would not repurchase or recommend.  I have a very strict night routine...wash, toner, serums, moisturizer and then face oil. When using this product, even if I wait a full hour between this and oil, it pills beyond belief! It does not play well with any of the multiple facial oils that I use...it just rolls off my face in big balls of yuck! There are just too many Good products out there for me to waste my money on this. I can only say that I'm thankful that I purchased when on sale...",
