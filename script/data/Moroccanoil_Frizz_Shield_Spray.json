My hair looks instantly shinier and feels silky-soft after styling. What I love most is how effectively it controls frizz and flyaways, even in high humidity, and the results truly last for days. The added argan oil makes it even better, keeping my strands nourished while protecting them from heat. This product has become an essential in my routine. Complimentary from moroccanoil",
