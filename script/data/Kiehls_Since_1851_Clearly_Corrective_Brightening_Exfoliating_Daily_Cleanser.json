Most cleansers are too mild and cause breakouts or completely strip/dry out my face.\nEnter: this cleanser.\nI was actually shocked at how soft my face feels. I do notice more even skin tone too, but honestly still just getting over the shock of of how clean and soft I'm left feeling. It's wild to me.\nI could see this being too abrasive for sensitive skin as it's a physical exfoliate, but for me this cleanser earned a loyalist.",

        "comments": "Ok people...I've honestly never tried the original formula mentioned in other reviews, but this stuff is amazing! I'm 50 and I have struggled with oily T-zone, acne/cystic acne for years and finally have clear skin! I've tried every cleanser (admitted skin care addiction) and while I thought I found results with other cleansers, it would only be temporary. My 20 year old daughter swears by it! Her skin has cleared and she is able to go foundation free with flawless skin. We've been using for over two years. It has pearlstone that acts as a gentle scrub unclogging pores, leaving your skin soft and smooth. Although its a little pricey, a dime/nickel size amount will clean your entire face and neck, so a tube lasts about 3-4 mos. Love this product!",

Some worked for a little bit but most of them left me feeling dry, my acne returned and my texture was awful. I swear this cleanser has helped me with my acne and has slowly been brightening my mild acne marks. The biggest thing I?ve noticed and even my family/friends is the texture of my skin! It?s less stressed, red and more smooth in a sense. It has tiny exfoliants in it but it?s gentle enough to use twice a day. I bought this in January and it?s lasted me until May so it lasts a long time! Highly worth trying!! Please don?t discontinue this!",
