        "comments": "I'm 45 yrs old, with skin on the dry side, and have used BM Mineral Veil for more than a decade. This pressed powder has pros and cons. Pros Include: coverage smooths fine lines, it goes great over heavy or light foundation (I use MAC), covers nicely without a foundation, and looks great over eye cream (I use Dermalogica) and/or concealer (I use Bobby Brown). Cons: Over time, the powder puff applicator absorbs any cream or sunscreen you have on your face (even after I let it absorb), making the powder puff pretty useless after a month even after cleaning it gently. I ended up using Real Techniques sponge to apply.",

I like that this is just transparent and its also talc free. It blurs my pore's really well too. I might go back and get the tinted  version of this as well just to see if it would give my face just a little color. I am very pale and I usually need a blush or a bronzer after i put my setting powder on just because i am so pale. Definitely going to repurchase the transparent shade tho when it runs out. I really like it! Oh and last time I bought it, it came with a sponge which was actually really good.",

I take very good care of the health of my skin and am proud of the fact that at 44 years of age I do not need foundation. I do, however, need powder. Influenster and Bare Minerals asked me to try this Pressed Mineral Veil powder and I was quite impressed. Despite the patchy color of my skin, the powder is easy to put on with a brush and with the enclosed applicator/pouf, and sits on skin like a super light dream. It flawlessly mattifys shininess and yet blurs imperfections and makes skin glow. I loved every second of using this powder and have bumped my HD powder out of my daily routine and only use this now. The Compact is great too because you can take it on the go, (something one couldn't do easily with the loose powder), and the mirror inside the compact reaches the entire surface area of the lid of the compact. For some reason that tickles me. I recommend this to everyone! Only reason it's not 5 stars, it made my skin on my forehead a bit drier than I liked. I have dry skin, but I moisturize it to death. I feel like the powder sucked that moisture away on my forehead only. Other than that, I love it and I use it daily!",

        "comments": "This product was very lightweight which was the only thing good I would compare the texture to Makeup forever high definition powder BUT definitely not the performance of it......left a ghostly white reflecting effect very weird. DEFINITELY did NOT leave my skin matte at all not without makeup and not with using over matte foundation...nothing. My skin is combination at the moment, some dry areas sometimes tzone gets a little oily. End of the day my whole face was greasy and makeup had lots of creases. It wasnt even that hot outside, actually no humidity and my face was oily slick. When I patted it with a tissue, you could see the oil transfer. This product was a waste of my time. I have tried the foundation mineral powders from this brand and had the same problem actually worse, I had gotten acne on my face and rashes. This brand is not for me I'm done, I do not recommend. There was nothing MATTE about this product.",
