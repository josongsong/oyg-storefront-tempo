I didnt have trouble with acne but my husband does. I tried this line with him since my skin was problem free. Well after using this product for 10 weeks I have dark spots and acne. Which i never dealt with. My husband has even more acne than he had before he started. I have went back to anither brand I was using before trying this and slowly my skin is returning to how it was before trying buttah. Buttah isn't non comdogenic which means it has ingredients that could potentially clog your pores and cause problems or worsen your current skin issues.",

It also didn't lather up at all. I wasn't sure what the color of the product should be and looked it up to only find out it should be clear. I'm going to return to Ulta and hopefully they have one in stock at the store and I will be opening before I exchange to make sure the product color is clear.  If not, I will just try and order directly from the sellers site and hope for the best. I do also feel like the size of the product is a but small for the price. I can't give an accurate rating until I receive a product that is in the proper formula/color, upon opening and using but my review is based on the product Ulta shipped to me. They need to do a better process of checking their items before shipping out.",

It leaves my skin so soft, refreshed, smooth, and it genuinely leaves it feeling CLEAN. I love using this after taking my makeup off bc it doesn't further irritate my skin and it doesn't dry it out. I have dry skin most of the time but get oily prone in hotter weather or with makeup and I feel like this helps combat that. Cannot suggest this cleanser enough!",

It also didn't lather up at all. I wasn't sure what the color of the product should be and looked it up to only find out it should be clear. I'm going to return to Ulta and hopefully they have one in stock at the store and I will be opening before I exchange to make sure the product color is clear.  If not, I will just try and order directly from the sellers site and hope for the best. I do also feel like the size of the product is a but small for the price. I can't give an accurate rating until I receive a product that is in the proper formula/color, upon opening and using but my review is based on the product Ulta shipped to me. They need to do a better process of checking their items before shipping out.",
