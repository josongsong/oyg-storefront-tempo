It is now Monday and I can see a marked improvement after using it 4 times. It is amazing. I have crepey skin on my eyelids, puffiness, and sometimes get excema on my eyes (although it is not active now and I wouldn't use this if it were). It's nearly all corrected and it hasn't effected my excema!! I will definitely be adding this to my skin care list. My eyes are moisturised, the creepy texture has gone and the puffiness is severely reduced. Perfect!",

        "comments": "I use a whole range of Inkey list products, they are my go to brand for skincare, and believe me - I've tried every brand going. But unfortunately, this is one product that I do not recommend :( I don't have sensitive skin (my skin doesn't really react to a lot of products, fortunately), but 3 weeks in and I've had to stop using this. First week, I used it once a week, then twice a week after (left about 3/4 days between each day), and all used at night, not used with other AHAs or BHAs. 2 days ago, both eyes felt a bit itchy but looked fine, then yesterday I noticed my eyes looked dark in the morning, but didn't think much of it. Then last night, my left eye became a little inflamed and very red. Awoke this morning to red, blotchy undereyes and cheekbones on the left side, my eye is irritably itchy. I've used retinol on the face before, and other AHAs and BHAs, but I've never had a reaction like this. Doesn't help that it was more on the pricey side than most products too :( Don't get me wrong, it's a lovely feeling product, creamy and doesn't pill, but unfortunately maybe a bit too strong. Love the Inkey List usually, but not for this retinol eye cream unfortunately.",
