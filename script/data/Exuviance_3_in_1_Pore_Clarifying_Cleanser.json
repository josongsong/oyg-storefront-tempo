I've been applying it mostly at night, and every morning my skin feels more balanced—especially in my T-zone, where I tend to get oily.\n\nThe texture is super lightweight and watery, absorbs quickly, and doesn't leave any sticky or greasy residue. I love that because I have combination skin and I'm always looking for something hydrating but oil-controlling.\n\nIt contains a blend of AHAs, PHAs, botanical extracts, and salicylic acid, so I feel like it's targeting both my pores and the occasional breakouts without irritating my skin. I've already noticed a slight improvement in some recent blemish marks and my skin's texture is starting to feel smoother.",

I use their Gentle Cream Cleanser in the morning for extra hydration. When I do use the 3in1 I massage it in and leave it for a couple minutes and it works so well! I have combo/dry acne prone skin and this is perfect. No fragrance and doesn't irritate or dry my skin.",

I've been applying it mostly at night, and every morning my skin feels more balanced—especially in my T-zone, where I tend to get oily.\n\nThe texture is super lightweight and watery, absorbs quickly, and doesn't leave any sticky or greasy residue. I love that because I have combination skin and I'm always looking for something hydrating but oil-controlling.\n\nIt contains a blend of AHAs, PHAs, botanical extracts, and salicylic acid, so I feel like it's targeting both my pores and the occasional breakouts without irritating my skin. I've already noticed a slight improvement in some recent blemish marks and my skin's texture is starting to feel smoother.",

I used this cleanser twice a day for a couple of weeks and it left my skin very dry and shiny, with little breakouts all over my forehead - clear signs of over-exfoliation.  It was the only thing that I changed in my routine, so I am confident the cleanser was the culprit. I would not recommend this for use regularly.",
