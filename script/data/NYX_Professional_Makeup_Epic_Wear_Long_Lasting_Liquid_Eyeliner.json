So messy 💔 like i blinked and it went everywhere. When i was done i tried to take it off. It wouldnt come off and i was glad! But then it started to sting and burn and i tried to get it off frantically. It didnt come off but left me with a big stinging and burning puffy spot on my eye. It would not come off at all for many hours but it continued to burn and sting and when i blinked it would stick my eyes together. After i finally got it off both of my eyes hurt so bad 💔… now this could be user error lol. Im def not a makeup professional! I dont recommend this product for beginners. Def be careful when using it!",

When i then tried to get it off, nothing i tried worked and it barley budged. I scrubbed my eyelids raw with soap, makeup remover, lotion, vasoline and warm water. I tried everything i could think of and it barley worked. HOURS after initially putting it on, it has rubbed off some, but none the less, is just a terribly made product. I DO NOT RECOMMEND GETTING THIS. I thought i had just got one that was in a bad batch, but after reading many other reviews of people having the same problem as myself, ive just chalked it up to the product in general.",
