The first night I used it, I woke up with a better result than I remembered!  I use it as a night cream and the best I've used after tries with other products even over $400.00.  At 76, this keeps my skin supple and helps fade any remaining dark spots of melasma (I'm not a sun person) from years of HRT more than a decade ago.  Love this and hope they keep it around forever!  The only bit of wrinkles I have are around the corners of my eyes when I smile and I do that often when using this outstanding cream.",

The texture is nice light and fluffy so I can see myself using this in the warmer months. I like having one product packed with multifaceted ingredients so hopefully with continued use I'll see some lightening in dark spots and even out my complexion.",

        "comments": "Read the reviews.  Even though I did, I still wanted to give this a try but only purchased the 0.5 oz. Whew! I don't mind that this update doesn't have SPF. I prefer moisturizers without SPF since it's never high enough so I always layer SPF over it. Also I find that SPF in some moisturizers make it just sit on my face and never absorb. So I was looking forward to this. Not sure if this makes sense but it applied dry, with a thin chalky texture. Despite that, it never fully absorbed and rolled off no matter which foundation or tinted moisturizer I used. On days I didn't wear makeup, it looked nice and played well with my sunscreen, until I put on a mask. Then it would flake and pull all over my face and neck. And it's not the sunscreen.  This is not going to work for me. Another update that failed. After decades of using Clinique, I'm moving away from this brand with each update.  Aside from the moisture surge, there is no longer any moisturizer that I like from this brand.  I stopped buying serums from clinique when they discontinued the custom Smart serum.  I still love their toners and facial cleansers. For now.",
