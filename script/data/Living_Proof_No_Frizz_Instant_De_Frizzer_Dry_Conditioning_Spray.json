I have fine wavy hair and use this anytime I want my hair to look softer, tame frizz or scrunch out the crunch if I styled it wavy with gel. No one ever talks about it but I love it. Warning, the scent is super strong so you have to hold your breath when using it, but a small price for me to pay for how well it works.",

It works so well to tame flyaways and just make your hair look better. I'm caucasian with generally straight hair and curl it or straighten that depending on the day and this is a HG product for me. It's not like an oil or serum. It's kind of just like a hairspray. I will always buy this",

It says to use on wet hair, which works well. Sometimes I use it on the top of my head where my hair gets especially frizzy and dry--I wet my hands and rub on the top layer of hair. Then I wet my hands again and add a small amount of conditioner and rub my hands together to make the conditioner thinner so that it spreads better. I rub this on the damp hair, at it brings it back to life. Sometimes when hairspray gunks up my bangs, I wash just my bangs, then use a tiny amount of conditioner. It works like a charm.

This product is super easy to use, just spray it wherever you need it and you're done.\n\nThe packaging, the price are nice; boring but nice. My hair looked super tamed and a bit dull after one use and felt surprisingly soft. \n\nTo be honest, I would like a Dry Shampoo version of the Living Proof Instant De-frizzer, for an even better result on girls that doesn't have time at all or have greasy hair, because the long term result is a bit messy... What I didn't liked about it is that it made my hair look greasy a few hours after I applied the product. \n\nPro tip: it worked better, with a longwearing result when I applied baby powder to the roots of my hair before applying the Instant De-Frizzer. You can use makeup setting powder as well. \n\nAlthough this is my honest review, I must confess that I'm taking part on a contest.",
