After about 2 weeks of use, I can't explain it but my skin just looks….different. It's moisturized, smooth, my complexion is better. I'm glowing. I look how I did in my 20s. It's like time was reversed. I'm amazed. Now, will it work like this for everyone? No. But I can say it didn't clog my pores and it's not greasy. It's really an amazing product if you have extremely dry skin. I'll keep buying this regardless of the price.",

        "comments": "I was excited to try this oil based on the reviews. I had high expectations at the price point and was comparing it to my $8 squalane oil that I had been using and loving. So when I got the bottle, saw how small it was in person , that was the first letdown. but I figured, hey, this is probably going to be super awesome and amazing for such a high price and a small amount it's gotta be amazing... buuutttt it wasn't. I didn't like the consistency first off. I felt like I was putting olive oil on my face. I also didn't feel like it was moisturizing. Yes it's oil, but it just sat on my skin. I didn't feel or see it absorb in the same time my regular oil would absorb. I really can't pinpoint what the deal breaker was, it was just everything! the consistency, the amount, the price, the quality.. bottom line: an over-hyped, over priced, social media trend. this isn't the high quality product they want you to think it is. they slap a high price tag and make you think it's worth paying for BECAUSE it's a high cost. but really it's not. There are other clean oils that work better for a FRACTION of the cost (literally $8) that I trust way more and prefer to this DE one. truly think about why you're buying certain products and don't be afraid to return it! buy what works for you, and if you actually like this product and can afford to replace it every 2-3 weeks, good for you... but IMO this is NOT quality, this IS overpriced, and there ARE far better options.",

I personally love the Good Molecules squalane oil to finish my nightly routine and it costs under $15 and it always absorbs well is a clean product and I can use it all over my face and neck because it's so crazy affordable.
