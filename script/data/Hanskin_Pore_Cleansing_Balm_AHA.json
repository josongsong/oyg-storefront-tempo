        "comments": "I'm thanking the skincare gods for Hanksin's AHA cleansing balm. The lemon smell is subtle for those of you dubious of scents. The biggest thing for me is the price point. There are so many cleansing balms that are double the price or more and do the exact same thing (sometimes they aren't as good!) A little goes a LONG way, and it takes off all my make up no problem (and sometimes I can go a lil ham on eye makeup). For those of you moping about double cleansing, look up the benefits of double cleansing! Since I have dry skin, I only use micellar water in the morning, so double cleansing is safe for my skin at night. The biggest setback is cleansing balms are messy, but thats kind of just the nature of the beast. Go ahead darlin', take a chance!",

A little of this balm goes a long way. One of my favorite products for my 60+ years skin!",

I wanted something that wouldn't take away the little oil that I have left and make my skin too dry. I am very satisfied with this product for several reasons: \n1. It actually removes foundation. I use a gentle toner after cleansing, and there is very little leftover makeup on the cotton pad. \n2. It is gentle and moisturizing. \n3. It is the right price for the amount of product that you get. \n4. Despite being a balm cleanser, you actually get a good lather when you add water. \n5. It doesn't make me breakout.",

So, taking care of my skin is important. I picked this up when it first launched, the claims were intriguing.\nI have been using it consistently now for 2 weeks and my skin looks better than it has in a very long time! I am hydrated, the texture is much smoother and I just look healthy and beautiful. I have not noticed a decrease in wrinkles, ( I am 54), but I truly was not expecting too. My pores have not disappeared but they have become smaller in size. \nThe product itself is a balm. It comes with a tiny spatula, which I like. You pick up a small amount, warm it up on your fingers than apply to face. It smells clean and like oranges. If you are sensitive to scents you might want to steer clear or test it out first. The fun part is when you activate the balm with warm water. You place some water on your face and the product turns a milky white. And it just feels so nice. \nAfter rinsing and patting dry you can add your favorite moisturizer but honestly I have not needed to. \nDoes it remove all makeup? Yes. I have been putting it through the paces. I have not removed any makeup with wipes before using this product and it has taken everything off;mascara, lippies, blush, bronzer, foundation....all of it. \nI highly recommend this product and will definitely be repurchasing.",
