Buxom has the best color range with comfortable, cool tingling and are long lasting. Plus, the price is worth it compared to the other brands! Buxom is a little sticky, but I LOVE that. I cant stand runny glosses that end up mostly in my mouth. They wear super flattering and I hope they never change the formula because I would be truly devastated. Long live Buxom glosses 🩷💋",

        "comments": "I mostly use matte lip products, so feel free to take what I say with a grain of salt. I was looking for a semi-sheer berry shade, and Jane met the bill. I like the shade, and I like the tingle, but I wasn't a huge fan of how sticky it was. I also would have preferred a more even color distribution upon application, but this color seemed to go on patchy, and not apply tint evenly all over my lip. This may work well for you if you have darker skin tone and vibrant lips, but I found this shade looked sloppy over my naked lips. However, it does layer well with the Buxom pillowpout lip powder, and that evened up the tone considerably (start with powder, finish with gloss). \"Plumping\" seems to be a misnomer, but there is a bit of a tingle when you put the lip gloss on, which may or may not be pleasant depending on who you are. There was no visual difference in the \"plumpness\" of my lips after application. All in all a decent lip gloss but I likely wouldn't buy again.",
