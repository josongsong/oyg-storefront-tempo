I got amber (goes good with any skin tone) and i also got crysral for whenever i want sparkly lips (rarely). The feeling of this lip gloss is amazing. Not sticky,  not annoying, and not too heavy. This will now be my forever lip gloss from now on! I LOVE IT!",

I don't like dark brown lip colors that don't have a touch of red in them so it looks like something that should go on the lips ( I am a big fan of your Super stay 24 lipcolor in Endless Espresso because it is a brown color with a tiny touch of red color) so I tried the Topaz color.  It didn't show up on me and I have caramel-colored skin.  You had a dark-skinned model wear one of these lip colors on your website and it looks clear on her.  I think most women want a color that you can see or they would buy a clear gloss.  I'm upset that in this day and age you would create a new lipgloss without a full range of colors from light to dark that complement a variety of skin tones and show up on darker skin.",
