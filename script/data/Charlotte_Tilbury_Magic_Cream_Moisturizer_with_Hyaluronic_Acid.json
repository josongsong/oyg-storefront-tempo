        "comments": "5+++ stars. Amazing. Luxurious. And yes, absolute Magic. With the hype around this cream, I was skeptical, intrigued, and a little hesitant to try it. Why? Honestly, I was afraid I would like it and then I would have to tussle with the high price tag. The verdict, of course— this is an amazing cream that is truly transforming! It is indeed expensive, so let me tell you why I might just be hooked. \n\nWhen I received this voxbox, I was thrilled, even with just the beautiful packaging and jar. But, I was also a little unsure whether this cream would work for my skin. I have overall normal skin, with an occasional tendency for dryness and sensitivity. The cream does have a light scent— maybe rose— but it is pleasant, light, non-irritating, and it doesn't linger. The cream is a light- medium texture. Thicker than a gel, thinner than a \"standard cream\". At first, it seemed like this consistency would be too thick to wear under makeup and that it would be better as a night cream. But, I was wrong— this worked perfectly for both a morning and night moisturizer, blending seamlessly into skin and creating a glowing canvas for makeup. \n\nI applied the Magic Cream to clean skin, gently massaging it in and around my face. The box and website details the recommended \"Tilbury Tap\" technique for best results. This is a 5-step and 5 minute facial massage that starts at your cheeks and works around your face (see her website and/or pic here). This sounds lovely and it's fine for an evening routine, but I often don't have the time or patience for a 5 minute morning facial. So rest assured, basic blending works perfectly for this cream too. It's almost like a thin melting balm— it melts into your skin like magic! My skin readily absorbed this cream, instantly looking and feeling moisturized and glowing. Best part is that the dewy glow makes your skin radiant, but it doesn't make it sticky or greasy. Matte makeup formulas still work perfectly over this cream, giving with a smooth finish. \n\nSince incorporating the cream into my routine, my skin has been softer, firmer, more supple. I really get why this is iconic. My only complaint is minor— I wish that the cream came with a spatula or scoop. \n\nOther amazing details on the magic cream:\n\n❤️ The ingredients include Vitamins C & E, rosehip oil, aloe Vera, shea butter, camellia oil. These work together to brighten, smooth, calm, revitalize your complexion. \n\n❤️ The cream contains hyaluronic acid and a bionymph peptide for hydration and plump skin.\n\n❤️The box fills every free space and flap with product information and described the famous Tilbury Tap. \n\n❤️The glass jar is beautiful and refillable! Buy on the brand website, and the jar is engravable, and you can return your jar for a discount on a future purchase.\n\nI LOVE this cream, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. #MagicSkin #MagicCream #CharlotteTilbury #voxbox #skincare #moisturizer",

        "comments": "So I was super excited to he chosen for this campaign. I will start off by saying the packaging was beautiful. I love the look of the glass jar and gold lid. The cream looked quite thick and I was pleasantly surprised that it went on smoothly over my face and neck. The product didn't feel thick on my face it actually felt light. The smell was OK. It had a very slight smell of an SPF but it wasn't enough to make me stop using it. I've been using this now for over a month and I have sensitive skin. I haven't noticed any sensitivity reactions to the moisturizer whatsoever. That's a huge plus in my book. While I do like the product I don't like having to scrape out the moisturizer with my finger or nail. Maybe the product designers could come up with some sort of \"spoon\" built into the lid to assist in getting the product out of the jar. While most moisturizers at any price point usually last me about 6 months this jar is already more than halfway gone in only a month. I didn't see enough of a difference in my face to justify using it after this jar is gone. All in all I liked the product but with the price and amount you get in the jar I don't see myself purchasing it in the future. If the jar was larger and the product lasted longer for that price I definitely would. If I would've seen a significant change in my face while using this every morning and evening for a month than price wouldn't even matter to me.",
