I was looking for an affordable dewy setting spray. After using all of it, I can say I have never felt like it gave a \"dewy\" effect. I actually felt like it didn't do much of anything at all. The mist felt way too fine to really set my makeup. I found myself using so much of it just to feel as though I had a sufficient amount of producg on my face. My makeup had little to no staying power with it. Maybe it's just my skin type or the other products I was using? Feeling really frustrated, I ended up buying a more expensive dewy setting spray and it did everything for me that I hoped this product would do based on the advertisements. For an affordable product, its something, and something is better than nothing. But certainly not my daily driver.",

It has a nice packaging, amazing coverage and finish once applied on the skin with a nice scent. It is truly a must have for summer, it has natural ingredients and a quality spray nozzle. I love this setting spray, it pairs really well with the Power Grip foundation and makes your makeup stay in place all day. It makes you look radiant but not greasy. I have very oily skin, I don't usually go for radiant finishes but this one really surprised me unlike other products I have used. This spray helped me keep the oil at bay exceeding my expectations. This setting spray kept my makeup in place for hours. It felt great as it absorbed into my skin. I have always loved ELF products, the price is great, the packaging is easy and simple. There is no scent I can make out. Easy spray, soothing and smooth. If you want that radiant look, this is definitely the setting spray for you. You will feel extremely confident and sensual. I managed to keep my makeup looking flawless all day. It's lovely and lightweight, some sprays make your face feel very wet but this one is lovely and very well received... (see photo after application).",

The fine mist , at least for me , is too fine ; I can't tell if I have adequate coverage or not. I also find that it doesn't blur imperfections as well as urban decay does , and on aging skin that's especially important. The smell is also unpleasant to me ..best I can describe it is a wet band-aid .\n\nAll that said , the staying power is very impressive and on par with the more expensive sprays , and I like the natural ingredients.\n\nI still prefer the more expensive brand , but this one will do if needed.",
