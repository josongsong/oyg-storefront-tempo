I've tried other brands for comparison but they did not provide the coverage that I needed to conceal the dark circles and fine lines. This brand states 24-hour smooth wear and it provides just that. I use a setting powder as well. A little goes a long way. MAC do not change the formula.",

When I used it at home, there was a faint scent and the concealer consistency seemed initially creamy, but dried matte. It claims to self-set once it dries into the skin, but that it can be also set with powder to prevent creasing and maintaining longterm coverage.\n\nI applied it with a brush, as directed, and tested out its self-setting claims by setting one under-eye with translucent powder and leaving the other alone except to press it in with a dry beauty blender (also as directed). I'm far from a MUA, so this could be due to my skill level, but I noticed it looked more cakey with powder than without. I found more separation in the lines under my eyes on the side with the powder, but saw slight transfer on the non-powder side when testing with a tissue. With proof of transfer, I'd say I'd definitely prefer setting with powder than without. \n\nI also used a small amount of product to test coverage for hyperpigmentation and red spots on my face. I tend to prefer lighter coverage, so it provided a good amount of sheer coverage while still letting my skin look like skin. I tried adding more product to test a more full coverage solution, and it looked a bit dry. I was able to make it more skin-like by spraying fix+ after the fact.\n\npros:\n- applies creamy, dries matte\n- nice light coverage\n- skin-like with less product\n- buildable coverage\n\ncons:\n- any self-setting claims are very slight\n- has a light scent\n- more product looks less natural without fix+",

MAC is transforming from leader to follower and they're failing.\nI love that they give you a lot of concealer for the price, but the applicator is way too big and A LOT of product comes out of the tube. And, there's no way to put it back in.\nIt goes on thick and goopy, but if you wait five minutes, it dries down enough to blend. But, it will rub off while blending, so you have to reapply and reblend. Even after you set it, it will rub off.\nI returned this because I also bought the Shape Tape concealer mini at the same time. That stuff is DA BOMB! I just returned the MAC today after trying it for a week. Sold on Shape Tape.",
