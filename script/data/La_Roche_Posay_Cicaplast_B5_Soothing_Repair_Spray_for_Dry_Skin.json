When the skin is dry, its protective barrier becomes weakened, leaving it more susceptible to irritation, inflammation, and breakouts. This product helps replenish hydration and strengthen my skin's barrier. Highly recommend. Fyi, not being sponsored to say this.",

The product feels like it contains a lot of glycerin, which helps plump my dehydrated skin and gives that glass-skin finish without ever causing my sensitive skin to break out.  But, it does unfortunately leave a bit of a sticky residue on my normal/combo skin which takes some time to fully absorb. So far I have found that it still sets nicely under make up, but if you have combination or oily skin I could see this being too much.",
