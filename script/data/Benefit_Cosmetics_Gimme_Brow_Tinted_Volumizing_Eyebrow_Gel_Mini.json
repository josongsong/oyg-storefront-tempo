        "comments": "Benefit Cosmetics, I am thoroughly disappointed in the new line of colors for your amazing volumizing brow gel. I purchased the Warm Auburn BROWN 3.5 thinking it would work, but it is entirely too dark. I do not understand why you still have the 2.75 in the brow pencil and pen products, and the brow wax, but not the gel. Sadly, I am going to be returning this wonderful product because it is not a viable option, and you no longer carry a color to match us redheads- it is either blonde or brown-no inbetween. I am just going to have to go back to my tried and true Clinique cause it never lets me down! Thank you for the several years with the best brows everrrr!!!!!!!",

And while I will say, it's a great product overall, it does have downsides.\nFor me it does not stay, hold my brows and it is a bit clumpy. it wears off by the end of the day and cannot handle sweat. Plus it's hard to get into the small details of your brows.\n I'd definitely say it is good, but take into consideration the downsides of it, before buying, because it's definitely pricey 😬\nOverall, it's good for light brows, and beginners! 🩷",

My eyebrows are very thin, due to over plucking years ago with a mix of brown and white hairs. I lightly draw in the shape I want with my eye brow pencil, and then apply the GB gel in short vertical strokes. I HAVE BROWS AGAIN! Everything I've tried has not hedged up in the VERY humid Louisiana and Alabama heat, which often goes above 100 degrees! I can go about my day with workouts, errands, dog walks, and my brows NO LONGER melt! Thanks Benefit !",

I have hardly any eyebrows from constantly plucking since I was 9(I'm in my mid 20's now). I've tried to let them grow out for a few years, and they are super sparse and all over the place now. They simply don't seem to grow in some areas.\nSo I thought, this probably won't work for me. I've been drawing my eyebrows on since I was 9 years old (because I'd over-pluck), and tried all sorts of products including, more recently, eyebrow products with little mascara style brushes like this. They would dry and look ridiculous.\n\nAnyway, this stuff looks suuuuper natural. I bought this along with the pencil. I use this first to fill in my brows and then the pencil to make them look sharper where needed.\nEven my boyfriend said they looked super natural. They do, and this is exactly what I've been looking for for years.\n\nI should mention, this isn't waterproof -which is fine;I haven't seen anything in descriptions saying it was..though for the price, I would like it a lot more if it were. I will just be using Model in a Bottle to make it waterproof.\n\nThe only other thing I noticed is that there doesn't seem to be much product in the container. Again, ideally, for the price I would hope for a little more, but it is what it is and it does work wonderfully so can't complain too much.\n\nLastly, I ordered this in the darkest shade, which is cool toned. I'm pretty cool-neutral, and have dark hair, so it works great for me. However, I do wonder how this would work on someone with much darker skin than mysel, as well as those with lighter, cooler toned hair. More \nshades should definitely be made. \n\nOther than that, this stuff is wonderful and I'm super happy with it. I'm very self conscious about having sparse brows and my brows clearly looking very artificial, so I'll be using this as long as it's available.",
