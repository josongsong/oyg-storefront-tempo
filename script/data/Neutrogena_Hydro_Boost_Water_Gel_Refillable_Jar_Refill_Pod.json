I've tried everything from lotion, to other moisturizers, to vitamin E and more - nothing seemed to work. But after trying this for a week - I've noticed big changes! Upon opening, I first noticed the beautiful blue glass jar, not too heavy or difficult to open. The scent is pleasant and kind of floral, and it is light and airy. The texture of the gel isn't gel-like - it's more of a watery lotion - but you'll only need a dab or two to spread onto your face. It blends into your face like water, so a little dab goes a long way! It leaves no residue, no oily or greasy film - just feels like water on your face. After I've been using this for over a week and a half, I've noticed a big change on the skin of my face - less dryness, less flaking, and my skin feels soft and supple - better than it has in years! I truly think this is my new favorite!",

        "comments": "Overall, I thought that the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel and the Refill pod starter kit has definite potential but has a few characteristics that I would change and did not like. My overall perception of this product was a mixed 50/50. The product itself was great and felt great on my skin. It wasn't greasy what so ever and it didn't pill when I wore it under primer and make up. I didn't have to use much either. I can probably get at least 60 days of use before I would have to replace it. The one thing that I absolutely can not get over however is the smell of the moisturizer. It's strong and to me it smells like sunscreen that has gone past recommended shelf life. I don't think it's refreshing what so ever. I'm not normally sensitive to scent but I just can't get over it. The packaging was ok- if I could change one thing I would make the jar a little more heavy, perhaps make it out of glass instead of cheap plastic. The over all anesthetic is really pleasing.",
