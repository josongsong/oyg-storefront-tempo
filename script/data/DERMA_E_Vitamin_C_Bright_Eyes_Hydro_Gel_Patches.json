Trying to play some on they will easily rip. I do have nails, but they are not sharp and they never cut any other patches I've used. Now I just feel like I'm trying to finish it out of principal, but I really don't think they're doing anything. Would not recommend or purchase Again",

The shape of these pads are weird, they are not cut to fit under your eye and they have an artificial gold sparkly residue in the gel that is left behind which I'm guessing is supposed to be the \"glow\" this is allegedly supposed to produce after applications. Waste of money and do not recommend anyone buy this product. I'd give zero stars if possible.",

These were terrible! They're so thin and impossible to get out of the jar without tearing, and then they leave a terrible residue on your face. I didnt notice the residue as much when I wore them before work (just peeled them off and go), but when I put other skin care or makeup, they pill so bad and make my face look like it was peeling. Won't repurchase.",

I really dislike them. They're the worst, which sucks because they feel really good when you put them on. But they rip crazy easily, it's hard to even get them out of the jar in one piece.  I do think they have a lot of Serum on them, but unlike other eye patches I've used where the Serum absorbs into my skin after use, these leave a clumpy, sticky residue that makes my eyes water if I rub them accidentally. And my skin does not feel good or hydrated or rejuvenated when I take them off. Where the eye patches rest on my cheeks causes me to have pretty severe acne flare ups. Other eye patches I've tried that were shaped the same never made my skin break out. I really wanted to love these, but they just did not work out for me. I do not recommend.",

What an incredibly easy way to stay true to your green ethics by cutting down on such a large amount of waste that occurs when these things are sold in individual packs! \nAs always, I'm OBSESSED with the fact that DermaE cuts out all of the nasty chemicals that are found in sooooo many beauty products these days. As an expecting mother, I'm especially conscious of what is being absorbed into my skin, and I love being able to still give myself a little TLC without being paranoid about what my sweet babe will be absorbing into their growing body!\nI inherited the darkest eye circles you've ever seen from my dad...and they're the bane of my existence. I was hoping for an actual miracle in making the darkness disappear and didn't necessarily see that...BUT, my under eye area was DEFINITELY brighter than before using them, AND I'm really hoping that over time and continued use, I'll continue to see improvements there. \nJust as a heads up, when I applied the first patch from the top of the giant mountain of them, there was quite a lot of product on them....(which, you obviously want!) But there was so much that the patch started slip sliding down my cheek. haha. I wiped some of it off and reapplied it and it worked like a charm after that. \nI was provided with product in return for my honest, unbiased feedback.",

While the product is good for hydrating and depuffing, I noticed that it did not sit well with the spf. Little white pieces started peeling off after both products came in contact even though I waited for the eye gel patches to dry off.  I've layered The Ordinary serums with my sunscreen in the past and this issue has never happened before. So be careful with layering the eye gel patches with other products especially if you're planning to use make up on that day.",
