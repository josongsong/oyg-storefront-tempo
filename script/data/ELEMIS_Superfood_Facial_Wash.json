The first time that i used it, I noticed how \"earthy\" the smell is, but not a good earthy, I didn't like it. Luckily, the smell didn't stick around long. After several weeks of use, my skin felt horrible. My red cheeks were so dry that i was having trouble moisturizing them enough. Needless to say, I threw the face wash away and tried to restore the balance of my skin for the next months.",

The pro collagen smells more like eucalyptus and fresh whole this smells different I can't explain the smell it's like a bad old lady perfume. I tried this a a few days and it overly dried my skin it just wasn't making my skin feel nice. I tried it with their rose oil and Holly Molly the smells combined actually gave me a migraine, also for reference my skin was so dried from the wash that no matter how much oil I applied it did not feel hydrated enough I had to return. I have normal skin I supposed more on the dry side",

        "comments": "I purchased this during the 50% off sale, thinking, *how bad could it be?* Unfortunately, it turned out to be the worst cleanser I've ever used. \n\nFirst, it burns your eyes. The packaging says to avoid the eye area, which I've never seen with a cleanser before. This is not only inconvenient but also challenging because you have to avoid your forehead as well to prevent it from dripping into your eyes. If you wear makeup, like I do, this makes it even less practical. \n\nOn top of that, it never left my skin feeling truly clean. \n\nI would avoid this product at all costs.",

It wasn't a shocking difference, but enough for me to notice and feel more confident about going without makeup. I've never felt that stripped-of-all-oils kind of tightness and still, my pore look cleaner.
