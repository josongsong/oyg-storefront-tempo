        "comments": "Wondering about the rescue balm with red correct formula changes. I have been a avid user of this product and can't rave enough about it. It had become increasingly hard to find in my local stores, so I placed and online order for several tubes(through Ulta). The product I received was not ole faithful, the texture was different(more like a silky primer instead of creamy), and the coverage was much less. The new  tubes, while still showing the same volume was in it, was slightly smaller as I compared to the many older tubes I have around. Is this a formula, change? If so, it makes me sad! The older product was far superior.",

        "comments": "I have used this ever day for probably about 4 or so years. I have acne prone skin. The old formula soothed my blemishes while also adding a little bit of coverage and color correcting the redness. The result was a nice moisturized glow. \n\nThis new formula is completely different and I hate it :-(. It does not color correct my redness, and offers no blemish coverage either. It's almost like there is less encapsulated pigments in this formula. To make it worse, this new formula makes my already oily skin SO shiny. I was a die hard fan for so long and now I can't use this product anymore since it does absolutely nothing for my skin.",

It's so drastically different I was shocked. They even slightly changed the wording on the tube but not enough to let buyers know they changed all things that were good about it! \n\nWish I could return it but I've already tossed the box. Such a waste and terrible change to such a great product for those with rosacea or redness. Disappointing!",

I was never big into makeup and skin care - my sister gave me a few things to try and i samples some things store employees recommended but everything just made it look worse but making it still red but now looked like i was obviously trying to cover it up in a gross way. \n\nIn my 30s i decided to do something about it and jumped into the wonderful world of skincare and in tandem - makeup. While trying to tame the flair ups, i tried to find something to cover it up - foundation, skin tints, concealer - all the products marketed to solve my problem didnt. They all made it look worse still…until I found this product from Hero. I found a tiny travel size and thought what can it hurt, ive tried everything else. I honestly couldnt believe it when i put it on after my morning skin care. I cried i was so happy - dramatic, sure, but true…if you have rosecea flair up that have taken over your reality then you might get it. \n\nThis magical elixir tamed the redness in my face while also looking like my skin and didn't make it feel like i had tons of make up on.  this product literally gave me back my confidence while i work diligently to get my skin barrier as healed as possible while living wirh rosacea. \n\nI also can use it as a primer and then top it with one of the good skin tint products ive found over time for more coverage, but even when just running to the store i throw this on quickly and poof, im no longer so self conscious of my bring red, splotchy face and i feel like a human again.  \n\nBesides the expensive Erborian version, which is pretty solid, but heavily scented and I cant afford, this one doesnt turn me orange like other renditions of this product that are in a similar price point. \n\nOnly issue: i wish it came in bigger bottles",

        "comments": "The new formula takes a former holy grail product and completely ruins each and every one of its good qualities. \n\nThe old formula was thin, easy to blend, and highly pigmented; it would only oxidize very slightly when drying, which on my skin tone resulted in a very natural coverage for blemishes. It was better for me than the straight green concealers due to its paint-like consistency and lighter color. I loved being able to use it as a standalone replacement for foundation/concealer on acne and red marks, to give my skin a break from having to put on full makeup. Plenty of days I would just dab on some of the old formula and my skin would look clear all day, but could also add makeup on top of it if I wanted and still benefit from the color correction on my acne underneath.\n\nThe new formula has the consistency of Neosporin, with an inexplicable grainy texture in the mix. It is sticky and sheer with barely any pigment, so there's almost no actual color correction for red spots. It is also nigh-unblendable and never fully dries. What it DOES do is oxidize into a dark orange immediately upon spreading.  So far from having a high-coverage, color correcting alternative to concealer, you get to have sheer, wet/shiny, sticky, orange spots on your face, which will immediately wipe off if touched at all.\n\nPlain green concealer has never worked for me, and I loved this product bc it offered both color correction and skin-healing benefits with an extremely natural finish. Now I've got to start over on finding a light-green color corrector with high coverage that dries to a natural finish and doesn't make my acne worse…what a huge bummer after having to search to long to find the old Hero balm in the first place. I never write reviews but couldn't let this one go.\n\nPhotos attached of the new vs old formula in swatches and used as coverup for a scab on my arm as an example.",
