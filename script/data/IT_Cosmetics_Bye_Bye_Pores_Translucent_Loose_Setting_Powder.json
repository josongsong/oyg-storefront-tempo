I work the powder into a puff, tap it off lightly, and *press into* all areas of my face that I want to set. (Not using a brush). Including my undereyes — very lightly with above method — with what's left on puff after the rest of my face. I follow with setting spray (my fav of that is urban decay) and I feel like my makeup looks great. Shrug. I don't get creasing around my eyes this way. \nI like IT CC Nudeglow w/ this powder a lot- finally just tried the CC. Can't comment on flash back in photos. \nHope they never stop making this!",

I'm not one of thos gals who checks her makeup every hour and does touch ups thru the day... once in the morning and done until my workdays over.  If I'm planning to go out later I'll simply wash my face and do a fresh application as opposed to caking more on. That said I don't see this to be the powder to use if you like the baking option when apply your makeup, it will look cakey with a white powdery cast.  The one con I'd say is price, it is waaay overpriced for the small amount of product you receive.  It really shouldn't cost more than $20.",

As a professional working makeup artist, based in Miami (where its hot and humid 24/7), it is honestly the only powder that with-stands the humidity and keeps you looking completely airbrushed, hence the title. It has no bounce-back, blurs out your pores and lasts all day. I always apply it with a brush, I don't really use the little powder pouf it comes with but I keep it inside to keep the loose powder from spilling out. Its so sheer and lightweight enough to use around the eyes.. I use this on almost every single client of mine, no matter the skin tone. Its great to use to set your foundation and concealer or on bare skin to control shine and mattify. I've used and tried many other brands of loose powders/translucent powders and this one is honestly my favorite. I highly recommend this.",
