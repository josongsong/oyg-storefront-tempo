I ran out of the supplied pads to apply the toner, but Buttah had them specifically made and didn't offer a link to purchase. I still don't understand why you would have something specially made to apply your product, then leave the customer to find something else? Does that not open the customer up to purchase something that may not work as well or offer the intended experience? I'll probably stick with the original set and not repurchase the Rosewater Toner.",
