But I kept testing until I found the right color and OMG I'm SO glad I did. This is the prettiest foundation I have ever tried, and have tried a lot of them. It went on so smooth, gave an absolutely beautiful finish, and the coverage was nice with just one coat but was buildable to give a more full effect. And it LASTED! I wore it outside in pouring rain for 8+ hours working a renaissance faire and it didn't budge! I can't tell you how obsessed I am with it, honestly. I got it during 21 Days of Beauty at half off but will 100% pay full price in the future (and stock up any time I see it on sale again!).",

I'm 47 and finding a foundation that works for my age, covers melasma and doesn't look bad is hard these day even though i have nice skin (other than hormone induced melasma). I do think the Ulta online color match system is not right. I looked like Morticia Addams in this (shade 120) when I color matched to my Armani Luminous Silk shade (4.75). Coincidentally, when I color shade matched on another makeup store website, it has it matching to shade 160. I guess I'm going to have a makeup artist shade match in person.",

        "comments": "I have dry &quot;maturing&quot; skin, but every other foundation made my face look soooo shiny! I have tried EVERY major brand out here, and each one has given me the same result... until this! I have been using this foundation for the past 4 years and I recommend it to everyone I know! It does not clog my pores, over dry out my face, and stays matte all day. There are some things that others may consider cons, but there is just a better technique for application to keep these concerns from ruining your Fenty experience... 1. This foundation melts into your skin quickly, so work in sections. I usually start on the lower side of my jaw, and once a bee coverage is there, I begin moving inward to my nose and under eye. If you try to apply this to your entire face at the beginning, it simply won't work. 2. If it seems cakey, apply with a makeup sponge, again, working in small sections. The moisture in the sponge with help disburse the product allowing for more buildable coverage. 3. If you think you are sensitive to this formula, use a primer on your face first. he primer can build a barrier between your skin and the foundation. This will not work for those with severe allergic reactions, but for the mild ones, it seems to help. 4. If you think this is &quot;too drying&quot;, use a heavier moisturizer. I have EXTREMELY dry and sensitive skin. Ya girl can't even wear sunblock because I am allergic to the metals in it kind of sensitive. But if you moisturize with a quality moisturizer (NOT A DRUGSTORE BRAND!), and let it fully absorb before applying your primer and foundation, it will keep your skin hydrated while still giving you a matte look throughout the day. 5. The formula is not necessarily changing, but your skin is. The winter will cause our skin to be drier, while the summer will typically be more oily. Along with the fluctuation in moisture, the tone changes as well. Most people have a winter, spring, and summer color. Sometimes a fall one as well! Even Rihanna has 4 different shades she wears depending on the weather and season. If you find that the color is off, that's ok. Just go a shade up or down, and since the travel sizes are still being sold, I would recommend getting a few to see what shades will work for you. Hopefully these tips can help someone!",

        "comments": "I read the reviews  on this, and it all sounded very nice. I must have gotten the wrong type of foundation from Fenty Beauty. This matte doesn't sit well on my skin. I usually have dry skin and patches. The sides of my nose has gotten sunburned and this flu nation clings to it and it's very noticeable. Probably, because it's a matte. \n\nThe foundation sat on my skin like weird. It is too dry to dab on with a sponge. Like when I put it on with my fingers here and there so I can blend it with my sponge, but it drys before I can get my sponge on it. It is a different type of foundation. I feel like you have to have Super dewy skin for this to work for you. My skin has been soft and fine with my regular color pop foundation which is a hydrating foundation, because I have been drinking a lot of water, I don't need moisturizer everyday at night to keep my skin soft other than the areas that recently got dry. \n\nI set my foundation under my eyes and some areas of my face with my sponge. It got caked on my chin and under my eyes. One day the foundation I guess had a date with the powder because all you could See was small-round powder on my chin. Weird. Definitely didn't set that area with powder the next day. I use the banana powder. Maybe it's too heavy or not the right weight? Setting my under eyes looked rough but the foundation was light feeling. \n\nOverall, the foundation was Light. Didn't feel like I had anything heavy on my face. The color I choose was too light. I felt like I was a vampire even with when I contoured. This isn't for my skin. I have to stick to hydrating foundations like color pop.",
