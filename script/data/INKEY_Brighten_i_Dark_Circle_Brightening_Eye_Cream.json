I LIVE by the Brighten-I Eye cream, initially I started using it religiously at night, and slowly begin to use it in the morning too. I'm 20 and felt that my dark under eyes were aging me. I now use it when I feel necessary, because it has worked so well. This product has replaced my concealer on days I want to look a bit more polished. The instant illumination when applied is literally amazing. If you struggle with the same problem area like me, I highly recommend both the Brighten-I Eye Cream and Retinol Eye Cream by Inkley List. Took 5 years off of my look, GET THIS NOW!!",

        "comments": "I have repurchased this product several times over the past few years. Recently, the applicator changed and I believe the formula did too - not only is the product more difficult to apply and doesn't have a soothing effect due to the applicator going from a silver metal-like applicator to a plastic tip, but the formula has changed. The product used to have a light, nearly scentless smell but now it STINKS, and I mean noticeably. I also noticed the overall effectiveness has changed. I used to look instantly brighter and now it does not have that same instant shimmer effect. I also noticed for me personally, the new formula stings my skin, which was not the case previously. I am beyond disappointed because this was one of my favorite products especially for the incredible price point. Please consider reverting back to the old formula and applicator!",
