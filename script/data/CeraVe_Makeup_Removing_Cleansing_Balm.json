This balm removes my makeup gently and effectively while leaving my skin hydrated and radiant.\n\nThis balm is amazing, not only is the texture silky smooth it cleans my face so quickly and gentle. It even gets my waterproof mascara off easily without me losing a bunch of eye lashes. I have always been so bad about washing my face but, now I look forward to it, so I can use this balm. You only need a tiny bit of this balm and you scoop it out, rub it on your face and it will immediately emulsify onto your skin with the heat. This balm has no scent so it is great for sensitive skin!\n\nI get really dry right skin and that's why I have always hated waking my face but, now I look forward to it because, I know I can effectively cleanse my skin without it becoming dry and tight. My skin feels moisturized, soft and clean. This is the perfect first step to my skin care routine!",

I tried the CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleanser Balm and it quickly and easily melted my makeup away - like most balms do. However, it left a very slimy , slippery , oily residue after rinsing off with water. It was far too oily of an after effect for my liking. Of course it was wonderful and helping my skin feel moisturized after using. Plus, I always wash my face with a cleanser after using a melting balm to get rid of all of the dirt and oil left behind. I just didn't like how my face felt after using this one. To slippery and messy. It does melt the makeup away effortlessly and beautiful. Would say it's gentle and easy to use. I did get the product for free to review.",
