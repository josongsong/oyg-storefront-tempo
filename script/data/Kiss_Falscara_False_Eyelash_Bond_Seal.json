        "comments": "I've been using this for years starting off with just the black invisible seal and now alternating back and forth with the clear bond. I LOVE this product despite what some other reviews say. I never use it with the kiss clusters, I make my own from strips like royal silk or buy other pre cut clusters. The trick with this product is to invest in the overnighter (a MUST) as well as micellar water for removal, specifically the one with the blue top. I see people complain about never being able to get it off but i use the micellar water and hold it with a makeup remover cloth for a min or so and I've never ever had issues getting it off. The only thing I will say is I kinda feel like the clear bond holds a couple days longer than the black bond. I also occasionally note a strong odor similar to acetone in the seal portion of the clear bond on a case by case batch basis. This is completely random but makes me think there's a slight variations with certain batches. If you don't get them wet too soon, touch them up every 3 days with the bond, seal, & overnighter, and leave them alone I find they can last a week or so.",

        "comments": "### **How ​​Falscara Bond & Seal works:**\n\n1. **Bond**: \n- This is the adhesive layer in the product, which acts as a light adhesive to fix the false lashes (lash wisps) to the natural lashes. \n\n- The formula is clear, easy to use, does not make the lashes stiff or heavy. \n\n2. **Seal**: \n- Is a \"sealing\" layer that helps firmly fix the false lashes and minimizes the glue from sticking or clumping. \n\n- It also protects the false lashes, helping to keep them clean and more durable. \n\n---\n\n### **How ​​to use Falscara Bond & Seal:**\n\n1. **Prepare lashes:**\n\n- Make sure lashes are clean, free of excess oil or mascara.\n\n- You can use an eyelash curler to create curl first.\n\n2. **Step 1 - Apply Bond:**\n\n- Use the brush tip to apply a thin layer of **Bond** to the natural lashes (like applying mascara, focusing on the base of the lashes).\n\n- Do not use too much to avoid stickiness.\n\n3. **Step 2 - Attach Wisps:**\n\n- Use specialized tweezers or your hands to clamp and attach each cluster of **Falscara Lash Wisps** under the natural lashes, close to the base of the lashes.\n\n- Do this from the outside in for a natural effect.\n\n4. **Step 3 - Apply Seal:**\n\n- Use the brush tip of **Seal** to gently apply to the base of the lashes to lock the lashes firmly.\n\n- This layer also helps remove stickiness and keeps lashes clean longer.\n\n---\n\n### **Notes when using:**\n\n- **Do not use on skin:** Bond glue should only be applied to lashes, not directly to eyelids or skin.\n\n- **Let real lashes breathe:** Avoid using the product continuously for many days without removing makeup to protect real lashes.\n\n- **Gently remove makeup:** Use a specialized makeup remover (KISS Falscara Remover or makeup remover oil) to gently remove false lashes without damaging real lashes.\n\n---\n\n### **Advantages of Falscara Bond & Seal:**\n\n- Easy to use at home.\n\n- Saves time and money compared to professional eyelash extensions.\n\n- Gentle, does not damage real lashes if used properly.\n\n- Creates a natural effect, not heavy on the eyes.\n\n### **Disadvantages:**\n- Not as long lasting as eyelash extensions in salons, usually only lasts 1-2 days.\n\n- May require practice to operate accurately and attach lashes evenly.",

        "comments": "I bought this expecting it to be a pretty long lasting glue, I like to wear my lashes for about a week at a time. After reading some reviews, I was hoping this would last at least 2-3 days, but it didn't even last overnight. I applied these and a couple hours later they were already starting to lift. After sleeping on them, they were barely hanging on. I'm used to sleeping with lashes on so I don't sleep on my face/roll around excessively. \n\nI don't think most people wear their lashes like this, so it may not be a problem. If you are just wearing them for the day it's just an ok glue, nothing special imo. I definitely would not get water on them. The pro is that the lashes stay very flexible and thin since you're not globbing on a ton of glue. For the amount of glue that you apply I'd say it holds good but if you are looking for something long lasting, I'd skip this. It would be very easy to reapply on the go though, so I do like that",
