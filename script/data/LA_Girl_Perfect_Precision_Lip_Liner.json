        "comments": "I really do love the product. I never run out of it and it is so creamy! The one deal breaker for me is that it doesn't last more than 15 minutes without fading or just disappearing completely! To test this out, I just put some on the back of my hand and patted it lightly, it faded so badly that it became barely noticable. If you are looking for a long lasting highly pigmented blush, I would search elsewhere. For some recommendations, I would say try the Elf lip liner, it is also very affordable ($2 I think) and I have heard amazing things about it. If you are looking for a minor flush or shadow to your lips this is the product for you!\n\n-Your Secret Beauty Superstar, Catherine",

I used to use liquid lipsticks, but they dry out my lips and causes cracks if I re-apply. These are pretty long lasting and can be re-applied without looking a mess. If you're ordering online and have never seen the colors in person before, some of them are similar to each other. The nude shades are almost the same. \"Bare\" comes off as a more pale nude while \"Cafe\" is a warm nude, and \"Sugar & Spice\" has more of a brown tone. I couldn't see a difference between \"Blushing\" and \"Satin Plum.\" \nThe only thing I don't like about these is that you have to sharpen them.",
