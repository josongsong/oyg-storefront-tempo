I needed to use additional cleansers to remove the foundation, but this did a nice job with my eye makeup and waterproof mascara.  It doesn't irritate my skin and hasn't caused any breakouts.  Overall, I'd say I like it, but I don't love it. I normally use a cleansing balm to remove makeup, and I feel like the balm works a lot better for me than this does.",

I realized that when I started to use this one, my acne was just out of control. I have sensitive skjn and have suffered from acne since I was a kid. As I've aged, my skin is less break out prone although still scarred. I thought I was at a point where maybe I can work on my pores and scars since I was not getting as many breakouts. However, this product gave me severe acne on my cheeks, every morning it seemed that I had more white heads popping out. I was using acne patches like crazy. I stopped using it and it has settled down significantly. \nI was very disappointed in this product. I tried to have the perspective of it gets worse before it gets better since my skin is sensitive, but it just was not worth what I was going through. \nI will say that that the product does feel oily but my skin felt light after washing it off.",

At first impression its a nice cleanser, but I've noticed multiple times the next morning that it didn't fully remove all of my mascara from the previous day. I don't even use waterproof mascara. After massaging this into my lashes and all over my face, I use a makeup eraser cloth in warm water to remove the cleanser, then move onto a water-based cleanser and so on. I'm still using this when traveling but once it's gone, I'll try something else.",

Fortunately, I found one that exceeded my expectations. This oil does an excellent job of breaking down product and removing all traces of makeup. It's become an essential part of my double-cleansing routine.\n\nWhat I appreciate most about this cleansing oil is how smoothly it glides onto the skin. Unlike other cleansing oils that can feel heavy and greasy, this one feels light and luxurious. The clean, refreshing scent is also a nice touch.\n\nAdmittedly, this cleansing oil is a bit more sticky than others I've tried. However, it doesn't bother me since I always follow up with a gentle gel cleanser. In fact, I think the stickiness helps to break down the makeup and impurities even more effectively.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this cleansing oil to anyone in need of a deep, thorough cleanse. Its ability to remove all types of makeup is impressive, and the smooth application and refreshing scent make it a joy to use. While I received this product complimentary from Benefit Cosmetics, I will definitely be purchasing it in the future.",

I realized that when I started to use this one, my acne was just out of control. I have sensitive skjn and have suffered from acne since I was a kid. As I've aged, my skin is less break out prone although still scarred. I thought I was at a point where maybe I can work on my pores and scars since I was not getting as many breakouts. However, this product gave me severe acne on my cheeks, every morning it seemed that I had more white heads popping out. I was using acne patches like crazy. I stopped using it and it has settled down significantly. \nI was very disappointed in this product. I tried to have the perspective of it gets worse before it gets better since my skin is sensitive, but it just was not worth what I was going through. \nI will say that that the product does feel oily but my skin felt light after washing it off.",
