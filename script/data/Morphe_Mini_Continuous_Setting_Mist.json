Though I felt confident in my new routine I found that I was super shiny, not hours later but upon stepping out of the house and I dont really have oily skin at all. I thought about what to change up in the routine, it took me one day of forgetting my setting mist to realize THIS was the reason I looked so greasy. On top of that I dont know what kind of setting job its doing, the slightest touch of a finger and the makeup is all over your hand. This stuff is wack.. confused how it has so many good reviews",

        "comments": "I have never been a fan of the \"Overhyped\" Morphe brand. It drove me crazy to see all these beauty influencers on YouTube pushing Morphe constantly, and always stating to \"use their code\" when purchasing anything from Morphe's website. I had never used anything by Morphe at that time, and I swore I would never fall into the hype. Well. Next thing I know, Morphe shows up in my local Ulta. Curious to see what all the fuss was about, I started looking, touching, swatching, and getting a feel of their eyeshadow pallets, and what they had to offer for such a reasonable price. I purchased the 3502 I think, and fell in love with the pallet. I then went on and purchased the infamous \"Jaclyn Hill\" eyeshadow pallet that everyone always raved about, gurus and regular people. Once I used her pallet, I climbed on the Morphe train, and bought a set of their eyeshadow brushes. I won't order Morphe online, but I'll buy it in store. I refuse to \"support\" or use ANY of these beauty influencers codes to make money off of me. Recently, I have seen this setting spray all over social media and youtube. I was told this Morphe setting spray was \"amazing\" and actually worked. So I went and bought it. I absolutely LOVE it too. First off, it's a very fine mist when you spray, not in globs. Secondly, it smells AMAZING. Third, it actually DOES keep my oily skinned, foundation in place. This setting spray is 15 bucks, and I used my Ulta rewards and got 3.00 off. This setting spray is really good, and I have no reason to lie or fake it. I love that it's aerosol, and how it doesn't leave a \"film\" or heavy feeling on your face after setting. If your curious about this setting spray, it works very well. I have oily, acne prone skin, and this hasnt broken me out at all. It smells divine, sets my makeup beautifully, and is better than alot of high end setting sprays out there. If you don't like Morphe, believe me, I understand. I don't like everything they come out with, but this setting spray is one I have to stand behind. I will continue to use this setting spray, and will probably buy another bottle when this one is gone. Don't knock it till you try it is all I'm saying.",
