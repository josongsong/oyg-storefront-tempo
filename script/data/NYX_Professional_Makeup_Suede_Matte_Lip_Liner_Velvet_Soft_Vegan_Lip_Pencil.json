They are long lasting and dont smudge easily, and tbh they hold up better than some expensive liners. The only downside is they arent the creamiest, so if youre looking for a creamy liner you might wanna go with another option. Overall really good for the price.",

But the actual color from the product doesn't match at all. It is a very dull purple. If it were one shade more brown instead of purple it could easily be a nude for people like me with deep complexion. The online swatch it horrendously inaccurate. If you are using the site as a swatch reference, don't. The product itself is actually very good. It's a comfortable smooth formula that glides right on. I prefer this formula to my Makeup Forever lip liner. If I found my perfect lip nude in this formula, I would never buy another liner again.",
