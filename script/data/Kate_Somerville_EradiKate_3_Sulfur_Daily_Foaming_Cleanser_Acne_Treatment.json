Although, I may not recommend using this as a mask every day for those with dry or sensitive skin. I bought two on sale. Luckily, you only use a small amount at a time so I expect it to last a while.",

It's not so red and inflamed around my mouth/chin where the dermatitis was/is. The filaments in my nose are way less prominent as well. I can tell my skin isn't so oily and inflamed after workouts and day to day routine. Overall, I feel like this gives me a good cleanse without stripping everything away and giving me that tight face feeling. It definitely feels more balanced and calm.

        "comments": "I am so grateful for this face wash! I was hesitant to spend the money since I had tried so many different recommended & highly reviewed cleansers with no luck (and sometimes those cleansers made my breakouts worse); but the EradiKate Daily Foaming Cleanser is a GAME CHANGER, seriously. I didn't struggle with REAL acne (not just your every day pop-up zit here & there) until a year or so ago and it just hit me as I started approaching 30. I have PCOS and my acne has been attributed to new hormonal changes with age, and buddy it's no joke: cystic acne, recurring deep & painful zits. At first I kept picking & popping them so I'm left with dark scarring. I now use EradiKate as part of my daily routine: once in the morning and once at night, and it has worked WONDERS! When I have breakouts, I can tell the cleanser starts working immediately to dry up the blemishes & breakout itself, NOT my clear skin around it. It has been fading the scarring and evening my skin tone (I'm white and fair-to-olive skin tone). I have combination oily to dry skin that leans toward sensitive (allergic to Benzoyl Peroxide) and have had zero problems with drying or redness. It leaves my skin super smooth and brightens it. The smell is not great, a little sulfuric - but who the heck cares when it works so well?? Just go along with your toner and moisturizer and it covers up the smell. My husband still loves the smell of my skin so it must not be bad :) To anyone suffering from late onset acne, adult acne, hormonal acne, etc., give it a try! It for real changed everything for me.",

        "comments": "I have used 3 Kate Somerville cleansers, so I can do a comparison of the three: Gentle Daily Cleanser, ExfoliKate Cleanser and EradiKate Cleanser. If you are prone to small breakouts and have combination skin, I recommend the ExfoliKate Cleanser for daily night time use. It is very gentle, but it cleans my skin without stripping it. I would re-purchase it and highly recommend it. This EradiKate is really strong and quite drying. I only use it on occasion. I would not recommend this for daily use unless you are very oily. It tends to strip my skin of its natural oils and then I have to moisturize more to compensate for it. It also smells of sulfur, so keep that in mind. You could use it as a spot treatment and put it on for a few minutes and wash it off at the end of your shower. The Gentle Daily Cleanser is okay for summer mornings, but it is a little drying in the winter, so I tend to use it very sparingly in the winter. I also don't care for the packaging, it's a twist open lid and it is quite fluid, so it runs everywhere.",
