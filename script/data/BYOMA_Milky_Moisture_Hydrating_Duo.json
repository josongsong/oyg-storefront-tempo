It leaves my face feeling soft and moisturized. The face wash does a great job of cleansing dirt, oils, and leftover makeup, but doesn't feel harsh or overly oil stripping. I have mildly dry skin and both products feel fantastic. I will definitely be repurchasing.",

Like the cleanser, it too contains a barrier lipid complex to reduce the appearance of dark spots & help skin look bright. \n\nBYOMA is Dermatologist tested and approved skin care.   It is \nalcohol-fee\nfragrance-free\nsoap-free\nvegan and cruelty free\n\nThis will definitely be a new staple in my skincare routine!",

I haven't used it enough to see a difference in anything but it is good so I have extremely sensitive skin I break out with almost anything and these products have not caused any reaction whatsoever which is a plus. Also they are fragrance free no odor and if you catch a little scent it's the product itself kinda feels and smells like panoxyl the acne cleaner. The texture feels like water it doesn't emulsify it's not soapy it's basically milky like it says. And the toner it's clear white also like milk and water and it dries quick. I don't own the whole line so I can only comment on these and I like them so I will keep using them.",
