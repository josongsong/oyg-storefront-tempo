The \"plumping\" sensation only lasts about from the time of application to a good 1 hour after, which honestly isn't bad for a drugstore plumper! I love, love, love the feel of this on my lips. It feels very cooling and sooooo smooth, it isn't thick and gross like how some plumping glosses are! You can def wear it alone or put it on before doing your makeup for a cute pout. I'd 100% recommend!",

It works alright and doesn't burn too badly, but if this gets into my mouth, which is pretty much inevitable since it's on my lips, it really feels like it burns my tongue. Like, if I drink wine within a few days of wearing this it feels like my tongue is raw. It doesn't feel safe or smart to use a lip product that irritates your mouth.",

I love thecway it feels both on the lips and application. It feels like fancy lip oil/ lip sleep mask. I genuinely dont like gloss cause they're thick and gets stuck on the mouth and crust up normally. This i couldn't wait to apply more. Bect ill wear with my favorite lip liner.

I don't really need a pumping affect to my lips, I have pretty juicy lips already, so it was not worth the discomfort.

It's a really good size lip balm that will last a good while too. I love the way it's so easy to use and feels so soft on my lips. It definitely gives me some fuller lips and they are just so plump; I love it. It's easy to use, glides right on my lips I love that it hydrates my lips and just makes them look and feel fuller. It has a nice, delicious scent of mango butter, vitamin E and a blend of oils in it that just really smells amazing but also hydrates and moisturize your lips. You definitely get that tingle feeling when you apply it, but I think it's working its magic to make your lips fuller and plump. I would highly recommend this product its fantastic and I absolutely love it!",
