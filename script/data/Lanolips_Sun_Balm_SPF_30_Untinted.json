I absolutely hate the sunscreen smell and taste. Ya know that chemically taste you can't get out of your mouth?? This does NOT have it. I'm not sure what others are tasting or smelling but the tube that I bought has zero taste. It smells a little cake-ish to me. It has a little shimmer in this formula but its minimal and so pretty.
