        "comments": "This is the best makeup setting spray I tried for oily skin. I tried 4, I think. It didn't matter how expensive the setting spray was; a higher price didn't make it work better. This spray is good because it does help to keep your makeup in place, will not add shine to your face, (although it doesn't actually mattify my skin), it is cool and refreshing, it dries quickly;(in like 15 seconds), and it does not have an offensive smell. It is just a light, clean smell. It does not give me allergies. It has charcoal in it which has antibacterial properties. It is a great price as well.",

Whether I'm just putting on some foundation and powder to quickly get out the door or I'm full on glamming it up for a night out Make It Last Matte Setting Spray is what I've been using for about a year now and I'm sad I didn't find it sooner. My oily skin does a number on my makeup, not to mention the slick look of it but this setting spray has been heaven sent. It's A Miracle Worker! Even with primers and all sorts of powders other setting sprays never stood a chance to my oily shine. But MAKE IT LAST MATTE Keeps Me Looking Cool For Hours. It says 16 hours, but I'm sure it's lasted longer.\n\nSome negative reviews have complained about the black residue. That's only happened to me once and that was because I was rushing and forgot to properly shake the product. Plus, there's a big sticker on the cap reminding you to SHAKE IT! LOL\n\nMy Only Real Complaint Is That It's Not Sold In The Jumbo Size. I Hope They Never Stop Making And Selling This Formula, Even If It's Not In The Jumbo Size.",

I have not had an issue with the spray leaving black dots, because I shake it up before applying it. I really hope that you guys improve the bottle. Also, I have noticed that on this website, this product is more expensive than in local stores. For this reason, I purchase for the stores rather than from the the website. I don't know that I would recommend this product due to the faulty bottle.",
