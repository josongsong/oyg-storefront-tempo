It works for me, but I always like to try different options. My other go to is the professional setting spray that one is quite expensive, but it does keep my makeup mat and lasting all day. This L'Oreal setting spray is a holy Grail. It's a continuous fine mist which I like as the other two you have to keep spraying, and sometimes the spray distribution is uneven many people State that the L'Oreal setting spray has an odor or a sticky feeling compared to hairspray. I personally did not find that to be true. It was a slow continuous mist with even distribution and my makeup lasted all day no transfer no budge normally when I wear my eyeglasses or put my phone up to my face, I will always have a make up residue on the nose pieces of my sunglasses or eyeglasses or I will have make up residue left on my phone. I did not have this with the L'Oreal setting spray so this will definitely be my go to brand from now on once I finish my other ones",

The spray is very nice it's very soft and not at all harsh or really wet.. me personally I like a setting spray it's going to help melt my makeup together so when it's either really dewy or a little wet and this one is neither so I'm not sure if I would be the targeted consumer for this but I do enjoy it the Finish is just a natural finish after it dries.",

Which is awesome! I would spray this on top of my creams before powdering, to help my base stay in place since that matters more to me so that the coverage my foundation and concealer provides stayed put. If I knew I was working a rough shift, I would also use this on top of my finished makeup. But as so many others have mentioned, it's essentially hairspray for your face. It smells like hairspray, sprays like hair spray, sticks like hairspray. This isn't something I would use on a daily basis because the hold it provides isn't necessary for daily use for me, but would definitely use for special events, wedding, prom, etc. I wore it during food service work to test its durability against sweating, steam, liquids, etc, which it definitely lived up to the hype. Outside of that, it's fairly heavy for daily use in my opinion. Overall great product and I would definitely recommend if you're looking for something that has a super strong hold and will stand up to just about anything, but if you're doing daily use  you'll need to buy quite a bit because it is a small bottle.",
