I have fine hair, but a lot of it, which gets frizzy in humidity.  The plates glide easily through my hair, it doesn't get stuck like many other inexpensive flat irons do.  It makes my hair shiny that lasts until I wash my hair again, and keeps the frizz to a minimum in humid weather.  I use this flat iron mostly to curl my hair.  I have a Babyliss curling iron as well, but I use this flat iron to curl my hair almost every day, and the curls hold very well!  I would definitely recommend this styling tool!  It is so worth the money!",

I went to Ulta initially to buy a Chi but an employee that was helping me indicated that she hated the Chi and that the Babyliss was 100% better.  I get home eager to flat iron my daughters hair after washing and taking her braids out. The iron heats up fast and has multiple settings which is good.  However, you can barely hold the iron where you need to keep it tight within your grip because the handle is too hot!  It did not get my daughter's hair straight at all and it did not smooth any parts of her hair including the ends.  If you have to do several passes through the hair and it's still not straight at the highest setting then it just simply is not a good flat iron. If your hair is super thin it may work but other than that, I wouldn't recommend this iron. Returning it TODAY.",
