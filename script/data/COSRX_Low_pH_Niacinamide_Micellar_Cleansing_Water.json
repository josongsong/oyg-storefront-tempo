I'm almost finished with the bottle and I've washed my face 1-2x a day almost every day for the last couple months which is amazing for me. It feels gentle and non-drying and I feel like I've seen a mild improvement in my skin since using it. I also struggle with skin picking especially while trying to do skincare (help), and this is a life-saver since I can clean my face really quick with a cotton round and add moisturizer and then get the heck away from the mirror, bless",

        "comments": "Ok, so I have been reading all about the two step cleansing and I have combination skin and could not find anything in the CODRX lines that I could use as a first cleanser. So I bought some Burt's Bees cleansing oil which I found very heavy and felt like I was just putting oil all over my face. It was hard to rinse and was not good for my face. I gave the BB away to a friend with dry skin. So I was stuck with the idea I should be doing a double cleanse but could not find a product geared to combination skin that felt like it cleaned. Then the announcement of this! Game changer! I have only used for about a week but I love that it will remove eye makeup and it feels like a toner and not an oily mess on my face. My face feels clean after the first step but I still used the good morning cleanser after. Thanks for making my first step cleanser come true! Also came well wrapped and packaged and the dispenser is not quick to pour so you do not waste product. It is a large bottle. Makes me happy! There is no Place to leave a photo or I would have. You link lead me to this.",

        "comments": "I think I like the Cosrx pads (poreless, green hero, etc), which I use like a cleanser in the mornings, more but the micellar water is a better value. I like the lack of smell. It has little soapy bubbles, which I don't like but which hasn't irritated my skin. I'm using disposable cotton things that were included by cosrx - they also sell them. I don't like those but I'm waiting for some stronger reusable/washable pads from purito so the experience might get better with those. I like the idea of being more environmentally friendly, so I might keep using the micellar water at home and the pads (like the poreless pads) for travel or for when I need something extra. Also, Cosrx is out of the pads I want a lot. Overall I don't love love this new product but I do think it' good.",
