Brownie was always my signature color. They stopped making it for a while, and I was so excited to see it come back! However, not only is it not as moisturizing, easy to apply (it used to glide right on), and long lasting, but it is a totally different color! I have searched far and wide for a color that compares and wears like the original. I wish they would bring it back. :(",

And it's a pretty nice lipstick in that it goes on smoothly and is comfortable to wear.  But it's typical Bobbie Brown:  It's the brand with the best the best colors, and for me, it always has been, but it's also typical that it doesn't last very long on the lips, and even with lip pencil, before long it looks like I've never had any lipstick on.",

I found this brand's tinted lip balm, and fell in love so hard that I looked for what else was in store in lips, and when I saw the colors this brand had to offer? I HAD to try it. And to my UTMOST pleasure, the lipstick was absolutely wonderful. Everything other lipsticks wish they could be. The natural colors are to be adored, and the lipstick does not feel as cakey and thick as others have for me in the past. Also, the Ruby is the very first red that I've liked on myself, ever. The only bad thing I have to say is, I am sad I don't own all of them!",

        "comments": "I have dry lips pretty much year round, and while I can keep them under control with good lip care at night, I still have to be careful with the formula of my lipstick. This formula goes on smoothly and feels like a lip balm. It's a sheer but buildable color payoff in a creamy but not glossy formula. Because it's balmy, it glides over and sort of smooths any roughness on my lips. It doesnt gather into lip lines or chapped areas, and just creates a pretty, subtle, smooth lip look. I bought the shade Blue Raspberry, and I love the shade. If you like a coolish dusty rose shade, this shade is worth checking out. Its not too cool, nor too deep. It's a \"my lips but better\" shade for me. (I'm light skin toned with neutral leaning cool undertones.) I took off one star simply because I do feel the price is a bit high for what this is. But I'm definitely happy to have splurged on this one and happy to have this in my collection.",

The sleek black matte surface of the tube and the color band are striking but the real surprise is when you take off the lid. The tube color continues right to the lip color. No longer do I need to open each tube to find the color I want to wear. Genius. The formula of the lip color is sort of \"crème meets stain.\" It applies easily and feels creamy on the lips but is less opaque, like a stain. I have worn both Babe and Ruby and was pleased to see how both colors adapt to my medium-fair skin tone.",

In terms of moisture/ balminess, I find this lipstick to be actually below average. Not particularly drying, but not nearly as soothing as the website suggests.\n\nCOLOR: The pigments are quite nice, but Babe turned out to be way off \"medium warm pink\". It's simply just RED that really pops on your face, NOT an MLBB-tone as suggested by the description on the website. I guess this is a lesson that online purchases of lip products can be a gamble.",
