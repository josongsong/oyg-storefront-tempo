I am prone to bad contact allergies that will last 10 days at a time, and this is one product that I can wear. If I get it beyond my lips, my skin will react, but if I keep it where it's supposed to be, I'm fine. It does not have a fragrance and works better than Anastasia in terms of eliminating that ugly feathering that women of a certain age experience. It's a good product!",

It's too expensive for me to repurchase especially since it doesn't make a major difference on whether or not my liner will last throughout the day. There is a slight learning curve with this product, I had to figure out the right amount to apply and the waiting time before putting on applying lip liner. If you apply liner too soon after the liner will not glide on easily. Always wait until primer is tacky.",

The MAC professional told me to wait a minute while she got something that would help.  I had never seen this product before nor heard of it.  Once it was applied to my lips, a cooling and smooth sensation made all that stinging and drying disappear.  I immediately told her to get me one & put it in my basket.  I didn't even know how much it cost, it was just that good that I had to have it.  The only negative that I have about it is that there is not a whole lot of product, so I only apply a thin layer.  It doesn't take a lot, which is good.",

Not worth the price to try more.",
