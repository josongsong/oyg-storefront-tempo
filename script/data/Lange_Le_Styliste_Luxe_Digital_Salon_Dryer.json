I had bo recourse and it wound up in the trash. it was also quite a bit heavier. what a heartbreak!",

Ulta Beauty replaced the dryer for me, but I'm afraid to say that after 7 months the same thing happened again. I went back to Ulta Beauty and was told that this happens with this brand at lot. not just there hairdryers. For the cost of hairdryer this is not good enough, 2 hairdryers breaking after less than a year is rubbish! Thank you Ulta for replacing the second hairdryer with a different brand",

The first one the plug seperated from the cord after 6 months. Lange replaced it when I contacted them. The second one quit heating up within about 10 months and Lange replaced again under warranty. The third one died this morning after almost 13 months. It wont heat up and not much air is blowing out if it. I checked the filter and its fine. While I love the weight of this hairdryer and it works great when it works. The price point is way to high for something that absolutely does not last. Will be buying a different brand this time.

On the 250th pep talk, I finally decided that if it was between the L'ange and the Dyson, I was going for the L'ange. And besides, can you really put a price on feeling good and having great hair days? \n\nI wish I could go back in time and IMMEDIATELY make this purchase! This dryer is amazing. It's so light weight that it makes blowouts a breeze. My hair isn't frizzy or overly dried. I love that I can adjust the temperature as well as the air speed. The magnetic attachments are fantastic. I feel like a hair model. I'm a stay-at-home mother of a 2-year-old with the best hair in the neighborhood. This is hair that doesn't need to do the laundry, or the dishes because it's so shiny and clean that it inspires everything around it to be the same. 🤣 You can officially tell me nothing because my hair and I are having a moment and that moment can simply not be interrupted. \n\nMy sister, who owns a Dyson, said she liked the feel of the L'ange even more than her dryer and adored how quiet the L'ange is too. And then the results on her hair spoke for themselves. \n\nIf you are on the fence about this little beauty, take the plunge. I'm a believer now! I can't wait to take this blow dryer to my hair dresser and have her try it out. This is a game changer!",

        "comments": "I seldom leave reviews. But for the price of this product verses functionality I decided to. \nI ordered this and received Sat. Immediately opened it and admired it. The dryer itself was sleek and very light. Not a \"cheap\" type of light feeling either. Felt well made. Had the rubberized surface like all their other tools. Came with 3 attachments, 2 concentrators and 1 diffuser. Attached magnetically. Upon fiddling with it they seemed to attach quite nicely. Came with a little cleaning brush. It even has self cleaning as well (after the main cleaning to get rid of even smaller debris). Has 3 air flow setting and 3 temp settings. I was even more excited! I uave 2 long hair German shepherds and on the highest air flow would dry them out in no time lol. Now comes Mother's Day to try it out 😁and it was a huge disappointment 😢.  The attachments…diffuser is a diffuser but on LOWEST air flow it was still to powerful and was blowing my hair around but stayed attached. The concentrators would not stay on. The slightest tap/bump with my hand or brush to prepare next section knocked them off very easily. Became more of a hassle. Also the positioning of the buttons on the left side of the dryer verses front like most…was a pain. I'm right handed and the slightest touch to them was constantly changing the temp and air flow. Even if a person is left handed the buttons are at the palm and it was still changing my selections. It took so long to dry my hair because I had to keep putting the attachments back on after them getting slightly tapped and they came off or had to keep readjusting the temp and air flow. Now for my hair….end result was my hair ends (roughly 3\"h were fried looking and not smooth. I had to use a straightener to smooth ends. I have never had to do that with my other dryer. Maybe if the company modified it a bit to have the attachments more secure, like maybe a clip or something, and maybe a slim line cover to go over the air and temp buttons, then maybe I'll try it out again.",
