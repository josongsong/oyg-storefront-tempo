It seems secure but whats odd is that the applicator is so big that it almost doesnt come out of the tube, and when it does, it takes a lot of the product off. Initial application feels nice, luxurious and rich. I like the way it feels while wearing it, but it unfortunately doesnt last long. I cant consider this to be a lip mask because it doesnt last longer than 20 minutes. Absolutely not something that will work overnight as I had intended it to. I bought once but that is all for me. I do feel that it is nourishing and restoring to the lips, but the formula for longevity as a mask is not there for me.",

I don't hate this but I definitely don't love it either. It doesn't give lip mask but more so a lip balm with a different applicator (my favorite thing about this product tbh) and that's fine, just not what I was looking for. It's also not as hydrating/moisturizing as I was hoping it'd be. I'll still use it from time to time because it's not a terrible product overall but definitely won't buy again.",

The product slides overnight and wherever it sat and landed i was getting pimples.",

Occasionally I will notice some gritty texture and I'm not sure if it's the product or if the applicator is shedding onto my lips.",

This lip mask is all about giving your lips a serious dose of hydration while feeling absolutely luxurious.\n\nHydration & Texture:\nThe first thing I noticed is how incredibly moisturizing this lip mask is. It's packed with nourishing ingredients that leave my lips feeling soft and plump. The texture is rich but not sticky, making it comfortable to wear overnight or as a daytime lip treatment.\n\nSoothing & Repairing:\nIt's perfect for those days when my lips feel dry or chapped. After using it, my lips feel instantly soothed, and any cracks or rough patches are noticeably reduced by morning. It's like a rescue treatment in a jar, providing deep repair and protection.\n\nPackaging & Scent:\nThe packaging is sleek and travel-friendly, and the subtle, pleasant scent adds to the overall experience without being overpowering. A little goes a long way, so the jar lasts quite a while, making it worth the investment.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nIf you're looking for a lip mask that delivers serious hydration and repair with a touch of luxury, the BYOMA LipTide Lip Mask is definitely worth trying. It leaves your lips feeling soft, smooth, and pampered.",

I can't really say that I've had any Byoma products completely fall flat for me, as the very few that haven't worked for my skin have worked really well on my friends' family's different skin types. However, I have to say that I was quite disappointed with this product. Based on how amazing the moisturizers and barrier treatments are, I was really expecting a very hydrating and rich lip mask that would help to hydrate my dry lips. However, I did not find that to be the case. Based on the name of the product and the information on the package, I used the product as an overnight mask in place of my normal Vaseline. When I woke up, I found my lips to be dryer than normal if I do not use anything on my lips. I tried this multiple nights, and the same thing occurred. I know that some people use it as a lip balm/treatment during the day as well, which I tried, and had similar disappointing results. The only way I would use this product would be as a simple clear lipgloss-esque product, but even then, the shine it gives is much less than traditional lipglosses or even the Laneige lip mask (which I am also not the biggest fan of). I really don't know what I would use this for. I still love Byoma and its products and will continue to use and repurchase them, but I can't say this is one I would recommend.",
