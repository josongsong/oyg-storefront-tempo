Right away, the rectangular box-style packaging stood out to me—definitely unique for a lip product. This lip mask does a great job of firming and deeply moisturizing, which really helps prevent dryness and chapping. It leaves my lips feeling incredibly soft, smooth, and noticeably plumper. The formula is packed with ingredients that support healthy collagen production, boost hydration, and enhance fullness and lip line definition. Plus, it includes antioxidants that help protect the skin from damage caused by UV-generated free radicals, which is such a bonus. I'm especially happy it has shea butter and marula oil—two of my favorite ingredients for keeping my lips ultra-moisturized. Another thing I really love is how it improves the appearance of fine lines while still being super hydrating. It's such a win! I use it both morning and night, and each time it leaves my lips feeling silky and nourished. This was gifted by Drunk Elephant and I totally recommend giving it a try!",

The scent is a bit off, and the pot is smaller than I expected. For the price, I was hoping for something more luxurious or unique, but it honestly reminds me of a basic lip balm. I also wish it came with an applicator—dipping your finger in every time isn't ideal. Received gifted by Drunk Elephant",
