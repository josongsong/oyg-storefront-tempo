I purchased this product in hopes of getting away from CeraVe noght time moisturizer and using something less drying. I would not say this dries me out but it does not help retain water in my skin, either. And the price for what youre getting is pretty steep. Dermalogica makes way better alternatives and i would rather pay more for a product actually works.",

        "comments": "I received the brand new, award-winning ILIA The Base Face Milk and ILIA Barrier Build Skin Protectant Cream #Complimentary from PinchMe and ILIA in exchange for my honest feedback. All opinions are my own. ILIA is one of my favorite #CleanBeauty brands, so I was thrilled to receive these products. Both are non-comedogenic, vegan, and cruelty-free, with no added fragrance, gluten, or silicones. These formulas are designed with sensitive skin in mind but are suitable for all skin types. The Barrier Build Skin Protectant Cream is also accepted by the National Eczema Association. As someone with dry skin, my main skincare concerns are dehydration, hyperpigmentation, and overall aging. My typical skincare routine includes double cleansing, starting with an oil-based cleanser followed by a water-based one‚ followed by an essence, AHA toner, serum, and lotion. When I tried these ILIA products, I replaced my usual essence with The Base Face Milk and swapped my normal moisturizer for the Barrier Build Skin Protectant Cream. First, let' s talk about the packaging. Both products come in sleek, beautiful glass jars that give them a clean, luxurious look. The Base Face Milk contains ingredients like hyaluronic acid, which draws moisture deep into the skin for a plumping effect; a barrier repair complex to strengthen and repair the skin barrier; microalgae extract, a skin superfood packed with nutrients and antioxidants; and prickly pear flower extract to support skin renewal for a smoother, brighter complexion. The Base Face Milk has won several accolades, including Allure's Best in Beauty Award 2024, Best Essence, Best Clean Beauty Product, and The Skincare Award. To use, simply shake the bottle, dispense a small amount of the milk onto your hand, and gently pat it in with your fingertips. The texture is lightweight and resembles real milk when dispensed! It absorbs quickly and instantly leaves my skin feeling more hydrated and less tigt, îjust like my regular essence, but with added benefits. Next, the ILIA Barrier Build Skin Protectant Cream contains colloidal oatmeal to soothe and strengthen the skin barrier, a ceramide complex with fatty acids and sterols to replenish moisture, algae hydra gel to lock in hydration, and bioavailable calcium to reinforce the skin barrier. This cream is ideal for step 5 or 6 in your skincare routine, and Ive been using it as my final step. To use, apply a small amount morning and night, either on its own or under makeup. The instructions also suggest pairing it with The Base Face Milk for an extra dose of hydration. In conclusion, I was thoroughly impressed with both products. I'll likely repurchase them in the future, especially The Base Face Milk. At half the cost of my usual essence, it delivers comparable results. I highly recommend these ILIA products to anyone looking for added hydration, a repair for the skin barrier, and reduced redness. They're especially great for those with sensitive skin or eczema. Thank you @PinchMe and @Iliabeauty for sending me these amazing products to try! #HappyPINCHer",

        "comments": "I wish that I could say that I liked this product, (especially as much as I love ILIAs Super Serum Face Tint) unfortunately that just was not the case for me. I have oily skin so I'm used to using lightweight moisturizers in my morning skincare routine. However, out of all the years and all the many, many, many moisturizers I've tried I can't recall ever having one whose formula was so incredibly thin and super runny to the point where the amount that I put on the back of my hand would almost all run off before I had the chance to apply it all to my face. Plus, after allowing it to soak in it left my skin feeling a little dry, and sort of tight, but not in a good way, which made me feel like I needed to put more on and admittedly the first 2 or 3 times I did and I kept getting the same result, dry skin. As I mentioned, I have an oily complexion so dry skin is not a feeling I'm not used to, nor is it a feeling that I enjoy. I gave this product 3 stars though because I am fond of the ingredients in this moisturizer, and, I feel like this companies values very much align with my own and that is important to me. Now I do have to say that I received this product from PinchMe in exchange for an honest review and they also generously sent me a bottle of ILIAs Super Serum Face Tint which I LOVE! So even though I wouldn't personally recommended this particular product, especially if you have oily skin, maybe check out the face tint because it's amazing!",
