        "comments": "After using this for about two months, I'm disappointed in the quality of the tool. The bristles are extremely crooked, and there's no way to safely store the tool without that happening. I've also noticed that the bristles will gather a ton of buildup from heat protectant products. It looks like I've been using this tool for years rather than two months. It doesn't look like it's in good shape. I would imagine that due to these issues, that's why my hair doesn't hold the waves very well. I have the type of hair where it'll hold curl extremely well, but it doesn't hold the blowout effect very long.",

I then go back in to smooth it out with this brush. My hair is smooth and bouncy afterwards, and the effect is very similar to a blow out. The only con is the power button is located where I typically wrap my hand and I usually hit it several times. However, you have to hold the power button down for 2 seconds to turn it off, so it's not really an issue. If you're wanting to get the effects of a blow out without the hassle, this is a great tool to try!",

Enter the Infrared Heated Thermal Round Brush – an absolute game-changer for my hair care routine.\n\n**Effortless Styling for Thick Hair**\nThe Infrared Heated Thermal Round Brush excels at managing thick hair.

        "comments": "I was very hesitant on purchasing this because after using the Blowout Brush Pro I noticed a significant amount of hair breakage and damage- despite using heat protectants. My hairdresser even asked if I had been using one of those blowout brushes bc she could see all the breakage on her clients. I was eyeing this product when it was being promoted in February and when it first came out. I waited to ask my hairdresser what she thought about the new Infrared Bounce Brush and she said to stay away unless I wanted more breakage. I wish I listened to her, but I wanted it to work so bad and I was fooled by all the 5 star reviews. I feel stupid now that I bought into the whole &quot;No heat damage&quot; marketing. Here I am writing a review after 4 months of having this brush and let me tell ya it's not worth it. I only tried using this brush max 2 times a week -when it needed a little pick me up- in the beginning. After about a month I stopped using it as much because I was noticing breakage and more split ends. It made my hair look like it had years of damage and a million fly aways. Absolutely not worth the damage it's caused- extremely disappointed because I really wanted to love this product. Please be aware especially if you have fine or thin hair!!",
