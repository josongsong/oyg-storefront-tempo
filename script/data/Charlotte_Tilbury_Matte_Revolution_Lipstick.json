Applying lipstick daily is like breathing; so when you get a magnificent one, you delight in it. This red is the PERFECT vibrant red for full, bold lips. I'm not usually a fan of red though because I feel it washes me out; but not this beautiful color. It's more of a cool toned red that brings life back to your face. You can literally just line your lips and apply this and it'll feel like a great makeup day. The application is flawless! It's rich and creamy when you apply it but has the most lovely matte finish. It's just so pretty for any and every occasion. It's ideal for date night or the office. It's such a versatile color. The texture of the lipstick itself is just perfection and leaves lips moisturized. It applies seamlessly and stays on for hours! You don't have to worry about the color transferring or constantly needing to reapply; but the lipstick case itself is marvelous and luxurious so you're going to want to bring it with you everywhere and pull it out anyway. I love everything about this from the hydration it provides, to the perfectly matte pout it gives. I can't recommend this enough and I'm going to buy more shades because it's truly an incredible lipstick.",

But this was sent to me for me to use and provide my feedback on the actual lipstick brand and not the specific color.  I would not pick red for myself, i prefer warm/mauve colors.  But putting aside the red color of this lipstick, I'd say that it is a lipstick that definitely has a matte finish, wears well, goes on smooth, provides good coverage, softened my lips, and the color lasted all day long. I'm sure if the color option had been more suitable to my skin tone and shades I normally wear then I would have loved it even more.  If you love red matte lipstick then you'd absolutely love this brand.",
