I like to blow dry it straight- and that's about it. my old dryer from 2006 (lol) wasn't cutting it anymore, so I upgraded to this. it's obviously a lot more powerful than what I was using. I like all the things you get with it! the back piece (where the air sucks in) falls off anytime I put the dryer away. since it doesn't fall off WHILE I'm using it, I don't mind *too* much. just be careful not to lose it while storing!",

However, that crazy powerful airflow can cause a lot of knots and tangles especially if you are rough drying. It is also very loud so if you have sensitive ears, tinnitus, etc. this is probably not the best option.",

        "comments": "I previously had a super cheap hair dryer with no attachments. The Conair Luxe Pro dryer is so much better! The tip is pretty narrow, which lets you direct the air exactly where you want it  to go and with the concentrator attachment you can do an at-home blowout! The cold shot makes quite cool air, which both helps set a blow-out but also just feels very refreshing after all the hot air of drying. This dryer gets super hot on the hot setting so I used the hot setting at first when the sections of hair were quite damp but then I switched to the medium setting to avoid heat damage. \n\nIf I use the concentrator attachment and the included round brush, my hair gets super smooth and frizz-free! I attached a picture so you can see the smoothing effect of the dryer. \n\nNote: I have tried to do a blowout by following a YouTube tutorial but I had never done one before and I kept having to turn the dryer off to position the round brush so I think my hair kept both cooling down too much, and also I could not figure out the wrist motions to use the brush to give a curl. So my hair ended up just blowing it out straight— but with a super smooth finish! I think that with more practice of if you are someone that actually knows how to do your own blow out, this hair dryer will give a nice blowout: it definitely gets hot enough and already makes my hair smooth even without knowing what I'm doing. \n\nI had not owned a round bristle-brush before the one that comes with this dryer (and is matching purple!) so I can't compare it to anything, but it seems like it works well in terms of holding your hair in place so that you can use the concentrator attachment to smooth your hair. (If you don't know how to position the hair dryer to get the smoothing effect, I watched a Brad Mondo blowout tutorial on YouTube). \n\nI do not have curly hair, but my roommate does and she keeps borrowing this hair dryer to use the diffuser attachment. She has short hair so I can't speak to how it would work on longer curly hair, but on her short curly hair it makes the curls tighter and more defined. (Although her hair does not turn out as smooth using the diffuser as mine does with the concentrator— but this might be a user learning-curve)\n\nIn summary this dryer feels more powerful than my old basic hair-dryer: it gets hotter and the cold shot gets cooler. Having a hair dryer with a concentrator attachment and a round brush has been awesome for me, and the diffuser has been great for my roommate. The 2 drawbacks I are that the brush is kind of big (although I have a pretty small head) and the hair dryer is a bit heavy. I should also note that I received this hair dryer for free in exchange for an unbiased review/ but the attached picture will show you directly how well it works! Although, I will also note that I have also tried the Conair Dr. Knot Smoothing All-in-one Dryer brush, and if you are just going for a smooth straight blowout look, the all-in-one dryer brush is much easier to use and gives pretty similar results. My eventual hope for THIS hair dryer is that if I practice more I will be able to get a fancy voluminous/loose curl blowout look. So I think this hair dryer is more flexible— you can do any type of blowout finish. But it is harder to use since you have to coordinate the brush in one hand with the dryer in another (which apparently is hard for me, haha.)",

If you want a bombshell blowout, this won't work for you unless you don't mind having to go back and waste time applying more heat with a straighter or curling iron since this blow dryer could not do all that for you. I'm not new to giving myself a blowout.  if you want something super basic, the price tag isn't worth it. This is solely to just try and literally just dry your hair out. As hot to the touch this blow dryer  can get, you'd think my hair wouldn't still be damp after several swipes with the round brush, but it sure was and it made some parts look fried even with the best of the best on my heat protectant (i use sebastian spray)  and serums. It brought back memories in the 2000s as a kid being in a salon and coming out with poofy frizzed up mess for the whole world to see since nobody knew how to really blowout hair then with it being all about the flat iron. it didn't matter how small of a section i take or how good my round brush is- it just still felt a little damp. it made my hair look a little fried and frizzy. i'll be returning it. Maybe for \"thin\" hair, it's great, but if you have thick color treated hair- this won't work for you at all. It's a shame, because the more expensive blow dryers don't always last long. This one i'm told does...",
