I chose the Seek Adventure shade thinking it was a light/pale pink, which it is, but it has a strong undertone of purple and I really don't like that. No way to know without buying it either.\nIt goes on smooth, is buildable, and the edges stay for a while but the inside closer to the inside of your mouth disappears in minutes. It smudges, it clumps as it dries, and is unflattering after not long at all, and clearly does NOT last like it says it should. Not happy with it.\nProbably won't recommend.",
