        "comments": "Really great hydrating product that I will keep repurchasing because it's affordable and effective! A lot of reviews are complaining about the \"tackiness\" but that's normal with a super hydrating toner and you're supposed to use other products with it. A lot of people are also complaining about their skin not reacting well, but rosewater is known to be irritating for certain people and if you've reacted to products with rosewater before, you'll likely react to this too. If you aren't sensitive to rosewater, I HIGHLY recommend this product. Also, reminder to do your research on skincare ingredients and common reactions!",

I feel confidant it treats my skin well  , whether my skin is behaving, is experiencing extra dryness or flakey, or if I do have a pimple or trouble spots.\n I always give a spritz  ( I put my own sprayer onto bottle ) and pat in after cleansing with face wash/soap , and it calms my skin which is sensitive, and primes it for the next steps of skin care.\nI use it after a balm on a cotton pad to remove residue of balm , or makeup . \nIt`s nice to spritz on any time of day or night to freshen skin, to alleviate any issues ,  and on No Make Up days I use a cotton ball to swipe away any dirt , contaminants . \nI spritz on first in the morning when I wake up while having my coffee ;) \nI also mix up some of the fluid with a bit of aloe , and fermented honey for an extra benefit and use 1 - 2 x a week. after a mask, exfoliating, or when my face has felt  ravaged for any reason. \nThere may be a ton of other toners , the latest in miracle ingredients with benefits ... but I`ve found this to be tried and true  .   So gentle , no sting, no tightening, no irritation no effects that I have to combat with another product. . \nThe price going up and up no matter where I shop this toner is a disappointment , as price is within the top pros with performance .",

This may be because I would use too much product, but I noticed that it would leave my face feeling tacky after using it. \nThe first time i used this product was in mid April. as you can see in the photos i've attached, i woke up with dry, irritated skin and a rash on April 23rd. at this point, I had been using the toner every morning and every night for a week, as I usually would do with any toner. I discontinued using it for a few weeks until the rash cleared away, and began using using it every now and then to give it another chance, just to see if it could've been something else causing the rash. I started using it again every day for about two weeks staring in late May. I woke up this morning, on June fourth and noticed that once again, I have a rash and dry skin, I also have two new pimples as well, and have been noticing large pimples appear on my skin since I began using it again. I usually have fairly clear skin and am complimented and asked about my skincare routine all the time, so seeing these abnormalities pop up has lead me to believe that this product is the cause of my pimples, rash, and irritation. I would not recommend this product to anyone with dry or sensitive skin, despite the claim of hyaluronic acid.",
