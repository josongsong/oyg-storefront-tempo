Going to pick up the brunette shade instead. I have light brown hair with blonde highlights and blue eyes, fair complexion. The product comes in the standard elf packaging and you get a good amount of product for the price. The tube looks like a tiny mascara tube, with a  spoolie that is okay but I would prefer one that is a bit more aggressive. It applies the product well enough, (I have very thick eyebrows too...so take that into consideration), but then I need to go in after application with a firmer spoolie to work the color in to my liking. I recommend putting on some gel or at least spritzing a spoolie with hairspray and running it over brows to set the product in place. Overall it is a decent product. Not the best in the world, but not the worst either. Great price, decent product, I recommend if you are looking for a budget eyebrow product or are new to the eyebrow game.",

My cons are that not alot of product comes off so when I tried to apply more pressure the product balls up and then it looks weird.  It does look good when I fill in my brows over top but I got this so I didn't have to. I think this would work well on someone who has thicker eyebrows. I did return this.",
