I bought this during Ulta's sale and sad to report that it doesn't clean at all, it doesn't remove makeup, and it just stays on my skin like a lotion. After I wash it off, it just feels like I didn't wash my face. I used it to clean a makeup brush that I use powder on and nothing came off, it just made the powder stick more to the brush. That was concerning, I wish I could return it but I waited to use the product.",

I had so much makeup stuck to my eyes and face even after two washes. Makes the product even more expensive if you have to use it multiple times for one cleanse. I wouldn't get this again. I honestly just want to toss it out but that's so wasteful (as is this product).",

        "comments": "I was recommended to use Dermalogica products by my beauty therapist. I have had issues with my skin for 10+ years - not only do I have very sensitive skin that can dry out, but I also have oily, acne prone skin (particularly around the chin which is also due to hormonal acne). My therapist advised me to work on my sensitive skin issues first and recommended the PreCleanse Oil, Ultra Calming Cleaner, Ultra Calming Mist, and Calm Water Gel to use. I used them for 2 months with no other products. This is where I feel I went wrong, as incorporating an exfoliant or spot treatment may have avoided what happened. After 6-8 weeks, the areas that usually get congested got so so much more congested, I had never seen my skin like it. Red, inflamed, whiteheads everywhere, spots forming right next to and practically on top of eachother, hyperpigmentation, and many little clogged pores that I could see. I waited to see was this just skin purging but nothing changed. After I noticed this, I spoke to my therapist again and we added in Daily Microfoliant and Spot Treatment cream but unfortunately for me it was too little too late.\n\n2 weeks ago, I tested removing both the PreCleanse Oil and the Ultra Calming Cleanser from my routine (as I did not know which may be causing congestion) and have already seen a difference. My skin is slowly but surely improving from the fallout of the products I used. I definitely think these 2 products added to my acne issues but I also think I could have avoided it if I had incorporated acne targeting products at the beginning too.\n\nI am still using a number of the Dermalogica products which I love, but not the cleansers any more until my skin heals (it is going to take some time I imagine). I would still recommend Dermalogica but please please be wary of this if you get congested skin easily, as I used too much product, clogged my skin and suffered the consequences of it",
