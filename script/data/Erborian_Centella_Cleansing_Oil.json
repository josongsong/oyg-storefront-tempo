It does a really good job at removing excess oils, sunscreen, and other dirt and grime from outside. I highly recommend to give it a try and it also lasts a long time, you only need one pump. I bought it back in February and its not even half way finished (and thats with mostly consistent use).",

This oil removes make up very effectively and leaves skin feeling so moisturised - I only have to follow up with a little of the Centella Moisturiser afterwards. Can't believe how soft my face feels. I've definitely been converted! If you have sensitive skin, do what I did and order the small size first and see how you get on. I'm back on here today to buy the big bottle!",
