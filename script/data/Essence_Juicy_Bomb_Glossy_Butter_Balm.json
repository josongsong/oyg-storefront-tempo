They feel amazing on the lips, and the pink color is a really nice shade. Surprised at the color pay off! They are not sticky at all, and they feel so smooth and creamy on the lips. This is definitely my new favorite! And you can't beat the price!",

This is a really great dupe for the YSL lip gloss, I wish essence made these in more shades, especially neutral pink ones!!!",
