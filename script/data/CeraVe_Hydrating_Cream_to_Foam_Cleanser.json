Not drying, but since it doesn't clean makeup off it's at best a second cleansing step.  I have dry skin and love Cerave, but this really didn't do much for me.

        "comments": "CeraVe should market this as a makeup remover. This does a great job of removing long-wearing, full-beat makeup. I apply one pump to my face without lathering it first to break down the makeup, then wash a second time after lathering in my hands. I used Purity by Philosophy for 10 years- but this is better at removing makeup and is fragrance free! It does however dry out my normal/oily skin, so I don't think dry skin will like this as a cleanser.",

I have not found it to \"foam\" as much as I'd like but it does the job so I keep re-buying. Sometimes I have to wash 2-3x before it gets everything off, but I've followed a wash with a quick swipe of micellar water to get off any remnants of really stubborn makeup and it works very well. Will continue to buy!",

I stuck to the previous products I used for so long. I never strayed until I accidentally ran into a horrible article about a product I was using so I decided to change things up a bit. Plus I decided I could use a bit more hydration. Seriously, I researched for hours, days and finally decided to try and wow. Just wow. I'm so hydrated and happy! My skin looks and feels great! I can't stop touching my face! The cream to foam is the best invention ever it feels sooo luxurious. Please don't ever change or discontinue the cream to foam, the daily lotion or the replenishing night cream. I seriously think I would die. You seriously have a customer for life. I've gotten both men and women in my family using it! I talk about it any opportunity I have! I LOVE CERAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!.",

I couldn't figure out why and didn't think this could have anything to do with it because it was creamy, then after online searches, I found that deep in the ingredient list there's salicylic acid.  After discontinuing use for a couple weeks, my face feels better.  \nIf you don't have sensitive skin, this could be a good choice for you.\nI'd suggest more clear active ingredient labeling.",
