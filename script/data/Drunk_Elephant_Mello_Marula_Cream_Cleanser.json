Oddly enough, i had a feeling it would break me out knowing my skin, i gave it a chance but nope! And the smell…why does it need fragrance? Tbh, sorry DE but it made me wanna barf.

I have tried many Drunk Elephant products and really wanted to like them but just found them mediocre. When it comes to skincare I am more of a Dermalogica and Lancome girl.\n\nWell I ended up getting a pretty intense chemical peel last week and my skin was pretty raw. I remembered that I had this sample and that it had colloidal oatmeal in it so I decided to try it out in lieu of my usual cleansing balm. I was pleasantly surprised when I felt the texture, creamy and smooth, a small amout goes a long way! It felt soothing on my irritated skin and when I added water it gently transformed into a light foaming cleanser. It did a great job removing my makeup and left my skin feeling refreshed. I did follow it up with my usual Lancome Confort cleanser but I really don't think it was even necessary as the Mello cleanser did a fantastic job all on its own. I have already ordered the full size and it will now be a staple in my nightly skincare routine!",

        "comments": "The Drunk Elephant Marula Mello Cream Cleanser has been a winter essential for my dry, flaky skin. It's one of the few cleansers that leaves my skin feeling nourished instead of tight, keeping it smooth, hydrated, and glowing even during harsh, cold months. After incorporating this into my routine, I've noticed such an improvement in texture and radiance that I barely need to wear makeup. It's more than just a cleanser—it feels like skincare from the first step. The formula is packed with thoughtful ingredients that deliver. Marula oil provides deep hydration and antioxidants, while sacha inchi seed oil and baobab seed oil help soothe and replenish. The plant-derived surfactants gently cleanse without stripping, making it ideal for sensitive or dry skin. It also includes passionfruit oil and mongongo oil, which add to its hydrating properties and leave skin feeling soft and luminous after every wash. The cream texture melts beautifully into the skin, removing impurities without compromising moisture. For anyone with dry, flaky skin who struggles to find a cleanser that hydrates as well as it cleanses, the Marula Mello Cream Cleanser is a thoughtful, effective choice. It's skincare that works hard while still feeling indulgent. Gifted by Drunk Elephant",

        "comments": "I was looking for a good cream cleanser for my dry sensitive skin, i saw this cleanser had oatmeal and good lipids for your skin which i appreciate, it has a good lather - not too foamy, it washed off well BUT not sure what, i only used it for 2 days and i see little break outs coming in under my nose and chin. Oddly enough, i had a feeling it would break me out knowing my skin, i gave it a chance but nope! And the smell…why does it need fragrance? Tbh, sorry DE but it made me wanna barf.  I returned this item.",
