The only thing i changed in my skincare routine was my cleanser, and after about 2 weeks i had to stop using this product. It left my skin burning and peeling like I've never had before. I also had random pimples popping up in areas that i dont usually have acne. Very disappointing..",

My face is combo & my son's is sensitive. We both have used this & it doesn't irritate or dry us out. This one is Frangrance Free! It has hydrating glycerin along with essential vitamins B5 & B3. This reinforces the skin's moisture barrier, balances skin & removes dirt, excess oils & makeup without leaving skin dry or tight. \n\nPlease note I am not a dermatologist or esthetician. This review is based solely on my experience with the product. \n\n#ThatsFresh #Cetaphil #contest #complimentary @CetaphilUS @Influenster #cleanskin #youngskincare #matureskin #matureskincare #matureskinofinstagram #fragrancefreeskincare #fragrancefree",
