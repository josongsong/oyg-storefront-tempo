My skin feels fresh and renewed after using.   Today, I ran out of shave cream.  I knew this face wash had a very lubricating feel.  I lathered up with a wash cloth as usual and broke out the 5 bladed field cutter.  Fantastic.  Worked better than gel shave cream and did not clog up the blades.  Off-label use?  Yep.  But it works.",
