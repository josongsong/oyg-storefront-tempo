        "comments": "For the price, I do like this product. I have to be careful with my skin, as I've developed rosacea in my 30s and I have redhead skin. I do understand the reviews that mention that it pills and it doesn't feel like it completely absorbs into the skin. Ultimately I prefer gel moisturizers. BUT, because of the gentle ingredients, I like to keep this moisturizer in my lineup during summer and specifically at nights, (due to the pilling) and it does not exactly provide the moisturizing I need during winter months. It's good for 1 year after opening, so I'll keep it around to use occasionally or if I run out of my more expensive products. I like to use a few moisturizers in rotation that my skin agrees with throughout the year, as I feel like it helps my skin not get too used to any 1 specific product. All in all, not a terrible product but not life changing. But for the ingredients, price, size and pump, I'll reuse this until it expires or runs out. **I've never noticed burning from this product and I have incredibly sensitive skin**",

I was looking for something that wasn't \"lightweight\" like so many others like to advertise themselves as. I wanted something that I could actually feel going on and for a good 10 minutes afterwards. when I get out of the shower, despite using a hydrating face wash, I can feel my skin tightening up. I need to use moisturizer immediately. this definitely does the job and the dispenser gives the perfect amount of product. I was nervous it would give too much and be wasteful but it seems that's how much I would be getting out of a jar anyhow. I didn't know it was supposed to dispense in a cute shape like in the pictures because mine never has but that doesn't bother me. about every 2 weeks I like to wipe off the surface with a makeup wipe to clean any residue left behind. I've found that's the easiest way to clean it. the one thing about the packaging is I wish I could see how much product is left so I know when to get more. I also hope the pumping system doesn't stop at the top with a little bit still left in the bottle. I'll probably pry it open once it runs out just to make sure. because of the great price and how well it works for me, I genuinely plan on buying this again when I run out and I don't think I've ever said that about a moisturizer before.",

I do understand the reviews that mention that it pills and it doesn't feel like it completely absorbs into the skin. Ultimately I prefer gel moisturizers. BUT, because of the gentle ingredients, I like to keep this moisturizer in my lineup during summer and specifically at nights, (due to the pilling) and it does not exactly provide the moisturizing I need during winter months. It's good for 1 year after opening, so I'll keep it around to use occasionally or if I run out of my more expensive products. I like to use a few moisturizers in rotation that my skin agrees with throughout the year, as I feel like it helps my skin not get too used to any 1 specific product. All in all, not a terrible product but not life changing. But for the ingredients, price, size and pump, I'll reuse this until it expires or runs out. **I've never noticed burning from this product and I have incredibly sensitive skin**",
