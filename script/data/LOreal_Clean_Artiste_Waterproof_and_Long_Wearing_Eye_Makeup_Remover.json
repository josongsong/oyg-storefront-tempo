Gently shake bottle to mix, apply to cotton round, hold on eye for a few seconds then wipe. Results are amazing! Repeat a couple of times and rinse with water. Eye area is left very soft with no residual product effects. Love this product.",

This is the one product that comes the closest.  It's no surprise since L'Oreal owns Lancome.\n\nThe dual layer is really effective at removing waterproof and long-wear makeup, all over my face.  It is really gentle, and can be used really close to the lash line without any stinging and burning. It is a little bit greasy, but it's nothing a little face wash can't handle.  I have oily skin, and the minimal residue does not cause me to break out.  \n\nThe ONLY downside of this product is that the opening is huge, and the product pours out without much control.  You end up using more each time than you need, and go through the bottle a little sooner.",

I will not repurchase, because of the gross, greasy film it leaves. I have to wash my eyes again after using and I don't really need another step in my evening routine.",
