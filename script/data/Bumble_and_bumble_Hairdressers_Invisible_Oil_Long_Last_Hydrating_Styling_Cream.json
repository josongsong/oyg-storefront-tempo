Ive tried other gels, mousses, creams, sprays…. You name it theres a chance i have tried it. I mix a small amount with a mousse i really enjoy and let me tell you…. This really helped my hair. My hair smells great, my waves hold, and it helps the frizz a bit. I like to use it on my day 2/3 hair too and it still works great. When i diffuse my hair i usually like to keep it low/cool. Honestly i really enjoy this product and its rare that i give something 5 stars.",

Above all my style requires volume, and I constantly am looking for a product that delivers both volume and shine (many volumizers remove shine).  I thought this product might work, but it doesn't:  it does add shine but adds no volume or shape, and, worse, it deflates any volume that I am able to get from any other product used in combination (mousse, gel).  I don't want soft hair, don't want curl - I want volume that retains the shape that I get from blowdrying.  This has the opposite effect.",

I have short hair and this styling cream does not make it greasy.   There is just a very light sweet fragrance, so not overpowering.   It does control frizz and make my hair feel soft to the touch.  \nHowever, it's marketed as 'long lasting styling cream with style retention' and I have to say that hasn't been the case for me.   Beyond the frizz protection, my curls do not stay defined and I don't feel like there is a lasting hold.",
