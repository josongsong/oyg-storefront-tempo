        "comments": "As a health care worker I've been struggling with horrible mask acne for the past year. Huge pores, tons of black heads, and pimples covering my chin and cheeks. My friend mentioned it could be yeast acne and not a lot of things treat it besides a trip to the dermatologist. I've always been a fan of hey honey but the price has kept me away from buying more products. This acne got to the point where I was willing to try anything and LET ME TELL YOU I'm glad I did. Using this cleanser with the 24/7 day and night moisturizer changed the game. It's not drying at all and it leaves my face feeling so clean. I use it once a day on my day off and twice a day when I work. The foam is a great consistency and one pump definitely does the job. I honestly have no complaints.",

I guess I saw honey and got excited thinking it would at least have some kinda of maybe honey scent or something but sadly it didn't. The smell was a big turnoff for me but as I kept it anyway and gave it a try. I do love how it foams and does work very good in removing makeup, even stubborn mascara. I have combo to dry skin w/ oily T-zone and sensitive. This did not break me out at all. I was pretty happy with it although it didn't do anything special, overall it's a good cleanser. I would repurchase. That smell tho ....please change.",

        "comments": "In my late 30's due to illness I had to take quite a bit of super harsh drugs in high dosages including chemo...my forever perfect skin was destroyed. I had scaring, pot marks, dark spots, it was ruddy and oily, the entire composition of my skin changed and I was so upset. I tried everything including high priced products to reverse the damage and at least get back to where I didn't feel like I needed to wear makeup to go out, nothing worked. Then I remembered that I got a sample of this a while ago and I loved it! So I tried it again. \n\nI will never use another face cleansing product again. This is magic. My face is restored and although all of the damage will never disappear most of it has and I feel like myself again. I've been able to go back to wearing very little makeup and being confident again! This removes makeup and diet easily, it smells nice, and feels soft and not harsh. \n\nAll of the Hey Honey products are a life saver in my book! I use multiple products and love them all!",

I've been using this for about 2 weeks now and I haven't had any issues with it. It does feel a bit drying on my skin but since it's summer and I'm super oily it's fine. I only use it at night and i apply tons of moisturizer after anyways so it's fine. I do feel that this might not be something I use during the winter. I also feel that my complexion does look brighter and my breakouts have diminished a lot, and this is the only new product I have added into my regimen.",

I have sensitive skin that produces extra oil during the day because it gets dry, but the extra oil can cause occasional blemishes. I use an acne cleansing foam from another company(in the am only) that alleviates this problem so thought I'd try Hey Honey's brand. It caused my face to get red and to produce more oil. After reading ingredients discovered it does have alcohol in it...not good for sensitive skin, so I can't use it. Am hoping to return this product. However, I will say the foam has a nice texture and smells pleasant.",
