        "comments": "I'm so happy that I came across this product because in summer, high-slick pants are irreplaceable for me since my long hair irritates me when it's hot. I struggle with fly-away strands which create a messy look. I was looking for a product that does not make my hair greasy but makes my hairstyle look sleek. This stick is very easy to use. Most importantly, it is very easy to reapply because sometimes I need to fix my hair afterward, even though it has a nice hold. I don't like getting my hands messy when I'm outside applying gel or something similar, and this product is a lifesaver in those cases. It effortlessly fixes my hair with no mess and doesn't make it look dirty or greasy. I like that it contains amazing ingredients like vitamins and essential oils which are great for my hair, and it is clean. I'll definitely be repurchasing this product in the future. Kudos to Briogeo for creating such a product. gifted by Briogeo.",

        "comments": "I really had high hopes for this product and it had good reviews from others so I decided to splurge. Since it is summer and I have LONG straight hair, it iis up in a ponytail most days. First, the product is super tiny. I realize pics can be deceiving but wow it's tiny. The size is great for portablilty though as you can just toss it in your purse. Secondly, in using the product, it put the flyaways at bay for a short period, but at the expense of my hair looking completely oily and greasy in addition to feeling that way also, yet product feature advertising says the opposite? I wish it was a product that was worth the money I paid. Too expensive ,too small, ineffective, and no good smell.  either. Ugh",
