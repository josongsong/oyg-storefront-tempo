Settles into lines and looks greasy. I took this on a trip to Europe and was so disgusted with the performance I literally just threw it away. The good reviews must be fake or bought and paid for.

I wanted something that was just enough to even my skin tone without making it look like I had makeup on. I saw Skin Feels Good on Facebook and decided to give it a try. I loved that it had Moringa Root in it for anti-aging benefits as well as an SPF higher than 10 or 15. After trying B.B. creams and light coverage foundations from all the other major cosmetic brands and nothing working to my liking because they were all too greasy feeling after a few hours due to oily skin , I figured what did I have to lose.\r\n\r\nI just received it today and I was concerned by the shade I chose (04N Golden Sand) because it looked too orange for a neutral but it was the closest neutral shade that seemed dark enough for my skin and undertone. Plus my local counters don't carry it so I couldn't sample ahead of time. \r\n\r\nI couldn't be happier with the product!! Blended in perfectly and super light coverage just what I wanted. Plus after 7 hours, my skin doesn't feel oily or greasy! I'm very impressed!! It hasn't transferred or rolled off my skin either. I did use Visionnaire 1 minute blur as a primer too. I'll update this review if my opinion changes but as with most other Lancome products I use, I'm sure I'll continue to be happy!!",

I was told this was the best substitute, and I tried out every shade of Skin Feels Good that was close to my skin tone, but nothing works.  Bienfait BB Cream in Clair 2 blends perfectly with my skin tone and has been my go to product for many years.  It?s the reason I became a Lanc?me loyalist.  Now I will have to find another brand of BB cream.  I don?t like to spend time shopping around, and when I find a product I love, I stick with it and the brand.  If I have to buy a BB cream from another brand, I will most likely start using some of their other products instead of Lanc?me as well.  I really don?t understand the decision to eliminate a perfect makeup and skincare basic like Bienfait BB Cream.  If it?s not broken, don?t fix it.",
