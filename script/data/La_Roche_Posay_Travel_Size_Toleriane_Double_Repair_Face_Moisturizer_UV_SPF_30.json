These winter months were drying my skin out so bad and I just couldn't find the right one for my acne and oil prone skin. This stuff is amazing! Not only did it not break me out but it's actually cleared my skin up as well. I am so glad I tried this and I will definitely be buying another bottle. I've already almost finished my first one and I plan on making this a permanent purchase. I don't like to say something is a \"holy grail\" product because formulas can always change, but this is the closest product to a holy grail solution I've ever found for my skin! Just buy it, you won't regret it one bit. The travel size is perfect to test out, but I'm sure you'll end up using it all like I did.",
