The trick is to put a light clump on lip and then spread. Also kinda pricey…",

        "comments": "First off, I do NOT do reviews.  I may like something, but generally don't get \"wowed\" or feel compelled to write anything.  However, with this- just wow!  I have a medical condition that leaves my lips not only chronically dry, but a peeling, bloody mess.  They will literally crack open and bleed.  I have tried everything- and I mean everything.  I hardly wear lipstick because it is too drying.  I have been using primarily Clinique lip balm, but tried this on a whim from an online recommendation.  I was a little nervous of using lanolin- I am allergic to wool and usually avoid lanolin just in case.  I figured, my lips are already a mess, how much worse could they get?  I bought the tinted lip balm in \"Nude\", which is a very neutral, easy-to-use color.  I also bought the 12 hour overnight balm.  I use both together.  In just a few days, my lips (that have been raw for literally years), are HEALED!  No bleeding, no peeling, no stinging- just smooth, great-feeling lips!  And, added bonus, the balm doesn't seem to bleed into the lines around my mouth.  It is some type of voodoo magic!  This is a \"can't live without\" product for sure!!!",

I'm allergic or sensitive to a lot of plant-based ingredients but not to lanolin, so this is awesome, and definitely the best I've found for the price! The plain 101 ointment is great too, but this cap opens and closes more easily/comfortably for use throughout the day, and the Perfect Nude is seriously my lip color (medium pink, and rarely pale) but better. This goes on glossy-satiny and not sticky and then sinks in for a gorgeous satiny finish that lasts a long time for a balm. No scent, no smell, just a beautiful and pleasant texture. Because of the lack of taste or fragrance, I actually prefer this to some of the comparably hydrating but more expensive balms I own (bite agave, nuxe reve de miel). I love to use this with the mlbb bite lip pencil in shade 010 for a more polished and longer-lasting nude look.\n\nThe one caveat is that this formula/packaging combo requires a bit of thought to use without mishap. The formula is very thick when it's cool, and too much will spurt out of the large hole if you squeeze the tube too hard without letting it warm up in your hands first (30 seconds to a minute should do it). I also recommend holding the tube against your lips as you squeeze to help prevent this problem. When the spurt happened to me, I used the excess over my bb cream as a surprisingly long-lasting blush, glossy highlighter, and eye gloss multiple for a really pretty and fresh nude-pink monochrome look. Those with oily skin or darker skin tones may not have luck using it this way, but I'm dry and really fair, so I love it and will definitely use this as a multiple again! I fully intend to repurchase, and will be getting the Rhubarb soon for when I feel like going darker/brighter and pinker.",

I have keep on checking that the building is not there yet making me look like I didn't wash my face or clean my mouth in the morning. I thought this was because my lips are so dry but...isn't this supposed to be moisturizing??",
