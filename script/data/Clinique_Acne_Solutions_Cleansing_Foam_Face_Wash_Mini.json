As you can imagine i tried what felt like everything short of a dermatologist since it was out of my price range. After moving across country from dry heat to humidity my skin didnt take it well and i continously broke out. I have sensitive combination skin and tried this product a couple months back, my skin hasnt been this clear since i was a child and im absolutely ESTATIC about it. Id definitely recommend to at least try it, it hasnt helped with the acne scars yet (if it even does) but its cleared out the ance to the point where i can start to focus on getting the scars corrected \n\nShort summary: at least try it, in my experience it works!",

It also has salicylic acid in it as opposed to benzoyl peroxide which is a lot more harsh on the skin in my opinion and also increases your skin's sensitivity to sunlight. This stuff helped cut back on my oiliness but in the long run it ended up leaving my face too dry and tight (especially after using the toner). I have combo dry/combo oily skin (depending on the season) if that helps. Overall a really nice cleanser, just not for me!",
