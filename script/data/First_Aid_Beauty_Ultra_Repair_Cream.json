Recently, I had a minor skin issue on my wrist. It was red and itchy and I tried all my different lotions on it to make it improve. When I finally tried this, it disappeared. It's a light-weight formula that absorbs into the skin. No greesy feeling. I have never been diagnosed with skin problems, but when that issue happened, I threw away all my other lotions. I will never buy any other product again. I do like its unscented, so I can layer my scent sprays so there is no competing scents.",

        "comments": "About 2 months ago I tried using a kojac tumeric retinol soap bar to help lighten up some dark spots on my arms, thighs, and face. That bar completely destroyed my once oily combination skin to be incredibly dry and in a constantly flaky state. It also flared up the eczema/kp on my summer arms to go down to my wrists with itchy, dry patches that were so rough to the touch. I tried all my usual lotions then reached for an old bottle of ultra repair cream that I bought on sale last Christmas. It has immensely helped my skin recover over the past 2 weeks!! The eczema/kp on my arms has shrunk down to the back 9f my upper arms again. I'm hesitant to try using it on my face since I think this is formulated more for the body and not the delicate, thinner skin of the face. Either way, I'm so so happy that I still had a jar of this and plan to purchase more once it runs out.",

There has to be an effective product that won't leave a grease spot on my sheets and a hole in my bank account?! But if money is not a problem this cream would be my number 1 go to.",

I have way way way fewer incidences of razor bumps, ingrown hairs, dry skin, eczema… I'm pretty sure the list goes on, but this has been an amazing product for my super sensitive skin— healing my skin barrier and keeping my (previously) chronically dry skin deeply moisturized and glowy, not greasy. I wish the price point was a bit more sustainable when it's not a beauty steal item, but I gotta say - it's pretty worth it. Thank you FAB!",

Chicago winters aren't what you'd call mild.  My skin was so dry and irritated I was at a loss as to how to fix it. I came across this moisturizer and my skin was saved!  In less than a few days my skin calmed down and felt hydrated, not just moisturized. I haven't used anything else until last month when I switched to FAB's anti-aging moisturizer with peptides. I use both depending upon my needs. After exfoliating, on cold days, or when i just need a little extra hydration, I use my ultra repair cream.  This cream saved my skin.",

My dermatologist recommended lotions but all where quite oily and did nothing for my very dry skin overall. As a birthday gift for my 22nd I received this and other products, this lotion is so light weight, dries so fast and even brightens my skin. I used this with the cleanser and my skin looks amazing!! Harsher brands made me breakout but this is so light and straight to the point. I'm wearing makeup more now since my skin has gotten so much smoother from this brand. Haven't had a breakout in so long! Will forever be a customer now and always.",

However I noticed that I have some sort of allergic reaction wearing this...it feels fine at first but after a few hours of wearing it I notice my skin gets super red and EXTREMELY ITCHY (in fact the reason it's probably so red is because I can't stop itching). It's very uncomfortable and not like any regular itches I have...Even after washing it off and putting anti-itch cream on it, it still itches! Very frustrating, and results in unattractive splotches all over my face. I do not have eczema however I do have sensitive skin, so BEWARE either way. I'm actually curious as to which ingredient in this it is that gives the allergic reaction, as I do not usually get reactions to moisturizer creams. I know this is different for everyone, but does anyone know if there is a common allergic ingredient in this? If like to know for future purposes...",
