Its so great i showed uo for my color appt and used it the night before after a wash and not using product to have a clean canvas for color processing and my stylest said it looked like it was done professionally joking like i had showed up coming from another hair appt prior. Its easy, curls last, heatless and mskes hair feel and look healthy and can be used for not only curls but deep conditioning to lock in whichever leave in product you use on damp hair instead of dry hair when wrapping. But my curls come out amazing when i blow dry first and then wrap before bed and take it out in the morning. A quick flip and a light brush out around my part and bangs, a flexible hold spray and im hair photo ready! Dont think on this, just do it - you wont be disappointed.",

It is fairly comfortable though and seemed like it would have worked well if I would have been able to keep it in all night. I'm going to try a hair bonnet and see if that would help at all.

        "comments": "I have used the heat less curler twice. Once my hair was barely damp, and the other time I slept with it in. Neither time worked very well. There was barely a small wave in the hair right around my face. The product is one long \"curler\" that is supposed to sit on top of your head and you wrap all of your hair around it. It's difficult to wrap all the hair on one side of your head around one side of the curler, and the other half of your hair on the other side of the curler. It seems like having more than one curler would be helpful, if it could somehow stay put on the back of your head or something. I was skeptical about its effectiveness before I bought it, and I was disappointed once I tried it.",

        "comments": "I have very thick, wavy, but not cute waves, hair, and I've never been able to use a curling iron to curl my hair, because the curls never hold. I also have never had luck with hot rollers, with the exception of these curlers, that used steam, that we're around 100 years ago when I was in highschool. Okay I'm not that old, but my point is most have probably never heard of them, but they did actually give me curls that lasted, but I had to sleep with hard plastic curlers in all night, and the damage they caused 🙄, so many split ends. When I saw this at Ulta, while shopping with my daughter, I picked this up, as someone had just set it down where it didn't belong, and I asked if she had heard anything about this. She had, and she said that she had heard it worked. I thought sure, okay, how could this possibly work?! There is no heat, therefore no damage, so obviously we couldn't be so lucky that it actually would work. Holy moly I'm happy to report, per usual I was wrong 🤷‍♀️ I have no idea how, just wrapping my lightly damp hair around this, produces the beautiful curls this does, but they hold all day. In fact if I don't shower before bed, they will still be there in the morning, and look cute still. I'm not sure where the magic is in this silky thing, but I know it's there, and that's enough for me. Why would you ever use heat again, knowing it's just damaging your hair?? Also one time I didn't have overnight to leave it in, I had 4 hours. I figured it wouldn't do it's usual amazing job, but maybe it would be just enough so that I didn't have to straighten my hair. To my surprise, with only 4 hours time, it somehow still worked. See, I told you, magic 🤷‍♀️",

        "comments": "I am seriously loving this satin curling rod. I have long mid-back length color treated hair. My hair holds a curl fairly easily but mostly falls out by the end of the day even with setting spray. I'm trying to use less products and heat tools on my hair to keep it healthier. I ordered this satin curling rod on a whim because I have several other Kitsch products that I really like. Whoa! It took me less than 10 minutes to figure out how to wrap my hair the very first time. Now, I sleep with this almost nightly and it takes about five minutes altogether so it fits easily into my nightly skincare routine. I am a side sleeper so I was a little hesitant about sleeping in this thing at first. However, I just shaped the wire inside the rod around the curve of my head behind my ears, pulled my satin pillow sleep mask down over the top and drifted right off to sleep. Wearing this doesn't bother me at all even as I toss and turn a bit throughout the night. I wake up, do my morning routine, apply makeup, get dressed and then unfasten my hair. I flip upside down, finger comb the curls out and I'm ready to go. If I want tighter curls, I can wrap smaller sections more tightly and if I want looser waves, I wrap larger sections more relaxed. I've only used this overnight. One night, I snagged some of my hair with some jewelry and pulled a portion loose. I got up and had to rewrap one side after only wearing it a couple of hours. My hair had a good wave set into it already after that short period of time. Of course, it's all dependent on your hair type but I plan on playing around with the length of time I wear it. This product works well for me. I have several inches of curling rod left over usually so I gently fold it up and kind of twist it around back onto itself and secure with the scrunchies. I highly recommend this! It's a go-to beauty staple for me now.",

        "comments": "I have tried to use the satin curling set three times so far.  Unfortunately, my hair has not turned out looking anything like in the videos I've watched or the reviews I read. However, it might be user error. I have quite thick hair that is medium  length. (I have not yet tried using special curling gel or other special products other than my traditional heat protector gel.) Twice I have tried to use it with partially dried hair and once I tried it completely wet, planning to let it dry overnight. All three times, though, my hair will not stay put. No matter how tight I try to curl my hair around the wand, within 20 minutes, some/most eventually slips out and the hair that remains connected becomes very loose. (I tried to put a shower cap on my head the second and third time, hoping it would keep the hair tighter, but it did not help.)  Some reviews say it takes some practice, so I will give the product the benefit of the doubt that maybe I'm doing something wrong. Regardless, even with only the 20 minutes that it stays in my hair, it does create a bit of a wave and adds volume, so I imagine that if I was able to keep my hair in overnight or even an hour until it fully set, it may perform as advertised. But, for now, unfortunately, it is not working for me.",
