Although its not as hydrating as the one that I used to use which contained caffeine and coconut oil, this gets the job done. I just added 5 to my cart for my next purchase.

I like that this tiny little compact has its own little mirror! How handy is that for travel? It's come in very handy. Still, I did a cost analysis of this product gram for gram and found it's actually more expensive than the Tula one (which I also have). Do with that what you will as you get 1/7th product and pay 1/5th the cost. So if you only want a tiny amount (and it's a good amount for travel) then paying less at one time might be best especially for the packaging as this is a pot vs a stick format. I hope this helps! I removed one star because it is more expensive gram for gram than a more prestige brand.",
