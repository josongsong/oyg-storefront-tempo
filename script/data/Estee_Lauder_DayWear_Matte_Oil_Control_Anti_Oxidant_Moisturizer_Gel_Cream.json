I do enjoy the light scent, which says a lot considering how sensitive to scents I am (strong ones will trigger an immediate level 10 migraine).",

The oil control format is a game changer!!! It does dry my skin out a little if I use it everyday so I interchange it with the Neutragena's Hydroboost. It works so well at containing my oil throughout the day and my face is still pretty matte by the end of the day. I try to keep the usage for when I'm wearing makeup or not washing my hair that day (so my face doesn't add extra oil) because it is quite pricey and I find I need a use a little more than normal to cover my entire face and neck. But if you're super oily and looking for relief give this a try!",

I was excited to try this one when it was on sale, since the matte function of it plus moisturizing properties sounded perfect. \n\nThe jar is gorgeous, and the product feels light going on. It absorbs very quickly, and I find myself using a lot more than I normally would with other facial moisturizers. The smell is light and pleasant and if I'm having a no makeup day, the overall look of my face is quite nice. Unfortunately, I've tried several foundations over this moisturizer of varying formulas, and the all end up caking on top of my skin and looking blotchy and uneven. So I'm going to finish this on my days off and not repurchase. It's almost gone after about a month anyway.",

I apply my foundation around 8 in the morning and by 10, my foundation is slipping and separating and my pores are huge, and I am as shiny as a babies bottom! I would constantly have to blot with blotting paper about 3-4 times a day. The Estee Lauder Day Wear Matte Oil Control allows me to go through my work day without having to worry about any of that! I blotted once just to see and the sheet wasn't even half as used as what it used to be before. I know it is a bit pricey but completely worth it and trust me a little goes a long way! I have tried MANY more affordable oil control products and moisturizers to help keep me matte all day or for at least more than two hours and nothing has worked, at all! Even Cetaphil. I have searched far and wide to find a wonder product for the best deal, but with many failures, I broke down and ordered this and I DO NOT regret a single penny spent! It is so refreshing, smells amazing, I can tell a difference right away, and it goes so well under my foundation! Makes my makeup look beautiful all day! I was compelled to write a review for this one because of the wonders it has done for me and the confidence it has given back to me! I Highly recommend!",
