I think using the products on your face is perfectly fine for your eye too, with a few exceptions. But after trying this eye cream, I have to say I really liked using it. It doesn't irritate my super sensitive eyes and goes on really smoothly, absorbing in a short amount of time. It made my under eye very moisturized, I live in Canada and during the winter this is very important! It also reduced the appearance of fine lines and just made this area look more plumped. I haven't seen a reduction in dark circles but I don't really ever believe those claims, if you have dark circles, you have them; no cream is going to fix that. Overall, if you are looking for an under eye cream to add to your routine for a fresh and plumped result, I  would definitely recommend trying this product out.",
