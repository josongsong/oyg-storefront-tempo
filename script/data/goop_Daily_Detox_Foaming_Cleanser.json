This cleanser is gentle but removes dirt, grime and makeup without leaving my skin dry. The pump dispenses the perfect amount of product, and combined with a little water on my face, creates a silky soapy texture for massaging into the skin. It rinses off easily and smells lovely. I will continue to use this cleanser.",
