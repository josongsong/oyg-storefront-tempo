        "comments": "I am so upset. This was the only thing that worked for my sensitive, acne-prone skin. I recently ran out of the original moisturizer and bought this new one without realizing it had changed. In days, my skin broke out with painful acne all over my cheeks. \n\nWhy would you reformulate something that worked for so many people? Safe to say, I am returning the moisturizer I bought and I'll have to look elsewhere for something that my skin will tolerate. Very disappointed in LRP. Please do the right thing and bring back the original formula.",

I have eczema prone sensitive skin and my favorite thing about Toleriane line is that I can use these products during a flare up and know that it will not add to the irritation as well as use them in between flares without worry. \n\nThe Ultra Face Moisturizer is moisturizing, versatile, and lightweight enough to wear under makeup.  My office is incredibly dry. So I do mix it with a facial oil during the week. This has to do more with being in an dry environment for 8+ hours daily, 5 days a week. I still prefer the Ultra because it gives me the option to wear it alone, in conjunction with a facial oil, or under makeup without feeling like I'm coated in layers of lotion.",

The last time i purchased this moisturizer I had picked up two of the   new boxes and one old box. At the time I didn't think there was a reformulation only a name change until I had used the product. I go through one bottle a month and didn't notice the reformulation until last month when my acne started to come back. I didn't change any products in my rotation and realized that it is the moisturizer breaking me out and irritating my skin. It became obvious because the month when I used the old formula my skin was glowing, smooth, and even. As a loyal customer of many years I will now have to search for a new moisturizer, so I do hope you will bring back the old formula.",
