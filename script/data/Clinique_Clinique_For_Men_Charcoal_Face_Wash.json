After a full day of wearing wakeup, this product cleans and my face feels refreshed. I have combination skin, so it doesn't dry my skin out or leave an abundance of oil. I obtain whiteheads easily, but with this product, it helps make them go away and stay away. All it takes is this product and a face cloth, so it's extremely easy to use and keep up with maintaining a clean face. Additionally, I liked that this is a charcoal product that doesn't leave a ​leftover charcoal residue.",

I can see a visible difference in the blackheads, especially on my nose. My pores appear much smaller and the number of blackheads are reduced. The cleanser itself is a black gel that foams into a white lather so it doesn't leave a stain on your washcloths. I highly recommend this.",
