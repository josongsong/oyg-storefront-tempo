I really like that I only needed a little bit for each eye (just a dab), and it glides smoothly without leaving me feeling greasy or heavy. It doesn't cake up under makeup, and it doesn't irritate my skin. I discovered that my eyes were thirsty, and this was just what they needed. You can use this in the morning or at night (or both) after cleansing and toning. I felt like my eyes looked more rested after having used this nightly for 2+ weeks, and people were noticing!",

Even better this serum really works for puffy eye's in the morning. I put on and walk away for about five minutes to get some coffee and eye puffy is gone. Best I've ever used so I cannot live without this now. I always have wait for my eye to go down before I put on makeup so this is a must have. It doesn't leave any white residue or anything and it is moisturizing. I also purchased some new Beekman 1802 products through Ulta as well. I'm waiting for my order but I leave reviews at both Ulta and the Mercantile. Wow, Brent and Josh you're just knocking it out of the park. So impressed and I'm happy about the price point. It not so high so I can afford to purchase your products and they work and it's clean beauty. 100 stars!!",

I used it  the same way I did the first time but this time it gave ma a chemical burn on the upper half of my face,  around  my bottom eye area and eyelids which I instantly felt a tingling  burning feeling  that I didn't want to scratch cause the skin around your eyes are very very delicate,  so I just left it alone for a bit and grabbed a cold damp rag and pressed it on my eyes and cheekbone eye area. When I removed the rag off my face it was bright red ! with a tender tingling feeling to it. My skin is very very sensitive so it's hard to find skincare products that actually work for me,  I'm bummed that this product I was so excited about using and adding it  to my skin care routine failed me. Now, would I recommend this product ? Yes and No I say that cause if you have sensitive skin like I do I'd stay clear from using this I say yes cause it may work for others that don't have sensitive skin so yeah it's really up to you if you want to use it but sensitive  girls  I wouldn't use this",
