        "comments": "To start off with, it's an affordable lip oil. Lets be honest here that lip oils dont have to be $15+ let alone $10 or more. The color is cute though! \n\nIt's truly not bad the formula, but theres not enough product in this giant packaging! I purchased this a couple days ago and it's almost out. \n\nI dont like that their ingredient, it contains Red40, Lake Blue 5, and Lake Yellow 6. I understand in America it's very difficult to avoid these ingredients so you're welcome that I checked if youre avoiding it like me. \n\nThe formula is nice but it doesn't last and it can be drying. I noticed if I apply something moisturizing like aquaphor before hand, it won't dry out my lips.",

I like how it feels on thick but comfortable and the shine is great. Some have said it's sticky...if you apply to much it could be but you'll get more shine too. I applied lightly and pressed my hair to my lips not even a single hair stayed. It's not my HG but it's a solid product at a great price. I have products I prefer but they are much more expensive, in a pinch I would purchase this though.",

I was skeptical of this product due to it stating it was an \"oil.\" When I think of oil, I think of something that's thin and just sits on top of your lips and doesn't hydrate them at all. I took the plunge to purchase this anyway and BOY I'M GLAD I GOT THIS PRODUCT! :) It feels so good on my lips and surprisingly the consistency is much thicker than an oil. It's really like an actual lip gloss texture and too hydrating on my lips even after it wears off.\n\nI would totally recommend this product if that's what you're looking for! :)",

        "comments": "I got the honey honey shade. I typically like to go for a more orange shade with lip oils since they don't show up crazy pigmented with my pale complexion. I do not like the smell if you are into baby powder then this is for you. Sometimes when I apply it is so smooth and gorgeous looking, and other times it feels bumpy/gritty but still looks good but I cannot stand the feeling on my lips. the applicator has a hard/rough spot which does not feel pleasant while applying to the lips. It feels like something is scratching me. Not enough product as well! I've only had since last Monday and I am already more than halfway through the tube which is upsetting. usually a good lip oil will last much longer than 2 weeks. overall I am disappointed in this product.",
