It did NOT break me out at all. However, lime oil can be an acne or dermatitis trigger for many people, so keep that in mind.

        "comments": "I picked this up since I was out of my gentle facial cleanser (it was on sale). I have dry skin, so I found this ridiculously hydrating. Some people say it leaves a film (the ppl with oily skin), but it made my skin feel firmly hydrated, which was a first for me, since other hydrating cleansers never have left me feeling THIS hydrated. it comes out as a thicc jelly, which turns liquidy milky when mixed with water. it won't foam, but just wash for 30 seconds like the directions say, and it does its magic. Washing it off was odd, because there wasn't much to wash away since your skin absorbs quite a bit of it, and there is no lather to wash away either. I love that there are some skincare actives that are in the formula, that I don't have in my basic routine. So it makes it even better for me! (resveratrol is so under rated). I used to adore the daily moisturizer, but ditched it last year because of how similar my serum was to it, and the serum was cheaper. I didn't realize how much I missed mad hippie tho! 💖 The jelly is better than the cream cleanser, that just felt like lotion for your face. This one feels like it actually cleans my skin! Worth a shot for the dry skin gang ✨",

I have acne with rosacea and this cleanser has a load of rosacea friendly ingredients that doesnt trigger a flare up. I WILL say that this is not a cleanser that really foams up. If you want a foamy, Cerave like cleanser this is not that texture. It is definitely more a milk-like texture. Also i use this as my second cleanser when I double cleanse, i dont use it for removing makeup etc. I would recommend a cleansing balm beforehand as I dont think this product is strong enough to truly remove heavy makeup.",

        "comments": "I picked this up since I was out of my gentle facial cleanser (it was on sale). I have dry skin, so I found this ridiculously hydrating. Some people say it leaves a film (the ppl with oily skin), but it made my skin feel firmly hydrated, which was a first for me, since other hydrating cleansers never have left me feeling THIS hydrated. it comes out as a thicc jelly, which turns liquidy milky when mixed with water. it won't foam, but just wash for 30 seconds like the directions say, and it does its magic. Washing it off was odd, because there wasn't much to wash away since your skin absorbs quite a bit of it, and there is no lather to wash away either. I love that there are some skincare actives that are in the formula, that I don't have in my basic routine. So it makes it even better for me! (resveratrol is so under rated). I used to adore the daily moisturizer, but ditched it last year because of how similar my serum was to it, and the serum was cheaper. I didn't realize how much I missed mad hippie tho! 💖 The jelly is better than the cream cleanser, that just felt like lotion for your face. This one feels like it actually cleans my skin! Worth a shot for the dry skin gang ✨",

        "comments": "Like other reviews said, this left my face feeling even oilier than it was before, so i hated this in the beginning. However I'm loving it as a first step when I double cleanse. This is so good at getting all the makeup and sunscreen off my face without stripping it, plus I wear waterproof mascara a lot in the summer and this is so good at getting everything off without stinging my eyes at all! I can't even say that about makeup removers specifically meant for eyes. So if you bought this and don't like it as a primary cleanser, consider using it as a makeup remover, it works really well!",
