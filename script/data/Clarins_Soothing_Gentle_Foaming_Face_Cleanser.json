I used the old formula for years and adored it…the new formula is drying and my skin squeaked when washing off. \n\nI went to Bloomingdales to talk to the clarins rep and she confirm it had changed. She recommended this gentle version (pink bottle) and I was immediately sold. It's fantastic!",

I switched to a popular cleanser also by a popular French brand and was ok with it..because I had nothing to compare it to.\n\n I ran out and decided to try something different. I ordered the Soothing Foaming cleanser by Clarins. I tried it for the first time this morning and was blown away! It was so creamy and felt so good on my face. A little goes a long way! This bottle will definitely last me at least a year compared to the other cleanser that lasted me about 5 months. \n\nClarins never disappoints!",
