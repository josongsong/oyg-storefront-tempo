        "comments": "This past December/January i was experiencing eczema around my eyes and mouth and chin. The worst flare ive had in a while. I know i should not be wearing makeup while my eczema is active but it was the holidays and i wanted a foundation that wouldn't irritate my skin or emphasize dryness. This helped even out my skin tone and didn't irritate my skin. I did also buy the All About Eyes Rich and the 72hr Intense Moisturizer and I believe these 3 products worked great together. I was able to feel normal. The big con is the color selection of this foundation. I am a light medium skin tone and i bought the lightest fair shade. All the colors seem dark and a little orange. This product would be more popular among the sensitive skin community if they could work on the shades. I only wear this foundation when im experiencing a flare. I prefer Dior Forever Matte as my everyday foundation.",

        "comments": "Before you get discouraged from some of the negative reviews, understand this - any foundation will disappoint you if:\n1) you don't have a general understanding of your skin type (dry, oily, combo - also age) \n2) dont have a good skin care regimen (moisturize, exfoliate is just the start)\n3) try a primer\n4) use color correctors for targeted issues like redness or hyperpigmentation \n5) get the right color! ask to be color matched! \n6) shake up the product really well before each use\n7) decide which application works best for your skin AND the product; fingers, brush - even different brush types, sponges… this will all look very different with the same foundation. You may hate it one way, but love it another way\n8) Watch youtube videos from others who've tried the product. You may find someone with similar skin to yours who has some great pointers. \n\nTaking even just basic steps to care for your skin will give you much more payoff with the products you are using, and will help you make the most educated decision on which makeup products will work best for you and look great on your skin. \nI can't tell you how many times I hated a product at first, returned it, but then went back to try it again after having addressed my skin issues - and loved it. \n\nSo here's my review of this one: I'm 40, typically I'm combo skin but perimenopause has me so extremely dry like the sahara desert. Hyperpigmentation around my eyes. Redness on my cheeks. Broken capillaries around my cheeks and nose. Some fine lines. \nThis product addresses all of it. I've been on the hunt for a foundation that gives decent coverage, one that I can wear on no/minimal makeup days or build it up for some glam, one thats hydrating, has some radiance to it, one that doesn't settle or crease, has SPF and other skin caring ingredients… this one checks each box. \n\nIf you dont love it, return it. But do yourself a favor and give it a fair chance considering all that I've laid out for you. Otherwise no matter what you buy, it may disappoint you. And that's no fun.",
