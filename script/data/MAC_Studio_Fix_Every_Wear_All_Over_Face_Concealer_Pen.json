I ended up wearing Mac at a wedding that I was in and couldn't believe its staying power. So I bought this. It's what they used. Anyway , I live in the desert and it actually does ok there. Stays on pretty good most days , but when I travel to the coast , it's horrid. I don't know if it's the humidity or salt , but it  goes on badly and doesn't stay on. I have under eye circles and malasma. I also find it doesn't go on great at all as a foundation. I won't buy it again. It had its moments , but it's not great.",

I reserve this strictly for nights out/ events. Full coverage, longwear, satiny finish, photographs beautifully and the container is SUPER travel friendly. I really hate that they call it a \"concealer\". Can you use it that way? Maybe, if you're concealing underneath your foundation but I'd still say it's better used as a true foundation. Also, VERY IMPORTANT, because it's waterproof brush application is BEST! If you use a beauty blender/sponge you MUST use it dry. The water in a sponge can make the formula behave weird.",

If I so much as touch it it disipates, even though I bought the mac spray all night. My milani was less cakey than this. I was taught awhile ago to start using maybe a little bit more of foundation so it really gives that all over coverage. I keep reading people saying a little goes a long way but I don't feel this is the case for this or the other mac foundation I bought. I like the other mac one better I bought both at the same time thinking this pen was a concealer happy I did buy it. At the same time I likely will likely purchase the other mac foundation I have when I run out I feel its a little less chalky.",

        "comments": "I was gifted the Mac Studio FX by Bzzagent in exchange for a review. I was pleasantly surprised by the Mac Studio Fix concealer. I have very dark eye bags. My bags are almost a dark gray shade and take a bit of work to cover up. I've tried a handful of concealers both drugstore and higher-end makeup brands, and it usually takes two or three dabs of concealer to fully cover my eyebags. Even then sometimes I will still have some gray peak through the concealer. When I tried the FX, the gray seemed to disappear after one dab, and the color was very opaque. I didn't notice any gray peeking out. I loved the blendability. I used my finger the blend the FX, and I noticed how it naturally blended into the skin. I usually have to fidget with my foundation to hide the seams of the concealer. But with the FX, I could directly blend the concealer, without adding anything else. As a bonus, I found that the scent isn't too fragrant, and is very light, compared to other concealers. \n  \nDesign: The pen uses a twist mechanic to lock the concealer, when not in use. This is a great feature and addresses the inevitable spillage that may happen in a full purse. I really liked this design feature, especially because the pen was so big. The pen is also able to stand up by itself, and could easily be stored with liquid foundation bottles.  My family members struggled with the twist knob, assuming that you had to push the button on the bottom. But I found the pen pretty intuitive, with the twist knob and the press button mechanic. \n\nPros:\nI love the applicator. One of my grips with liquid products is the unsanitary nature of a lot of foundation/concealer. Foundation/concealer applicators tend to touch the skin, which degrades the product faster. \nCons: the applicator dishes out pea-sized drops which is often recommended by makeup gurus/and artists to distribute the product evenly on the face, but I wish I was able to control the amount.",

        "comments": "So I received this as a free product first of all but I definitely still preferred the pro longwear foundation to this pen the pen is pretty solid and bulky and I havent gotten to the end of it yet but I suspect it wont be as easy to squeeze out the remaining product until I can refill as the foundation was. Also worth mentioning the foundation was \nPoint 84fl 25ml for around 40 while the pen that tells you half a click is all it needs its not possible to do a half click the pen has only point 41fl 12ml it does not say or claim to be a concealer and I didnt need it to be a concealer I needed it to be the foundation product i was using years before they discontinued it and guess what IT KIND OF IS lol just half the product at BASICALLY same price and I really already see getting any last drops out a huge problem because now it is caged in a hard shell plastic container that is even bigger than the old foundation bottle the product is a little different than the old one and you prob dont wear the same shade it does not seem as matte as the last one so you will prob need a powder although it does not say it is concealer nor will you ever be able to get out half a click of product EVER Im sure this will be great for my self esteem I needed a full coverage foundation now ill be going through it like crazy and I guess my giant man hands will never be able to get out half a click because im sure nobody would put out a product that was impossible to half click people regularly go around half way clicking things try it with your pen if of course you dont destroy it with your big man hands pushing it. So I will say this product exists, you will need at least 2 if you expect it to last as long as your foundation which I sincerely hope you are able to afford I am not looking forward to the trial and error finding a new product to replace it with considering spending more on a higher end product since it would still be cheaper than 2 of these to last the length they previously did if you have never used this product in its foundation form then maybe it will be cool but it is BULKY Ill post pics.",
