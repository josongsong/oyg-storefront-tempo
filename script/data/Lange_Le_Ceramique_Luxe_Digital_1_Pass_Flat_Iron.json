This would make it shut off and I would have to restart it. I was able to hold cord in place against the iron and keep it on and keep using. Did that for about 2-3 weeks. One day it popped real loud a couple of times and sparks flew out of it. Scared me and luckily got unplugged and threw in trash.",

        "comments": "I was in need of a new flat iron and did a lot of research on different tools.  I liked this one for the sleek look, black color, longer heated pads than my previous flat iron.   It heats up quickly and can really straighten well. \nWhat I don't like is that the display says OFF all the time (when turned off) - this is a good indicator that it's off, but is also unnecessary especially when I usually leave my iron plugged in all the time and it leaves a glowing light in the dark.   I also don't like that the default temperature is 400. That is very hot and requires me to turn it down to a lower temp *every single time* I turn it on.   Lastly, I find that I have to 'squeeze' the tongs together a bit more than I realize to get it to hold my hair -- I don't think you should have to 'squeeze' that hard for a tool that is literally meant to be pressed together.  \nAll in all, it's nice tool at a nice price point, but I'm still debating whether to return it or not (inside the return period).  I don't think I would buy it again.",

I love my latest purchase the Le Ceramic. I like to use my Le Ceramic especially when I have gone 2-3 days without washing my hair because it has the ceramic plates that your hair will glide smoothly through. Like I said I love all my Lange' hot tools! If you don't have the Le Ceramic you really need to purchase one and I bought mine when they were 30% off any hot tool, you can sometimes run into a daily sale of 50% off which is really awesome! Purchase the Le Ceramic and you will have shiny smooth hair even when it has been 2-3 days without washing your hair!!😃 #langeproductsarethebest #purchaserfor4years",

        "comments": "I was in need of a new flat iron and did a lot of research on different tools.  I liked this one for the sleek look, black color, longer heated pads than my previous flat iron.   It heats up quickly and can really straighten well. \nWhat I don't like is that the display says OFF all the time (when turned off) - this is a good indicator that it's off, but is also unnecessary especially when I usually leave my iron plugged in all the time and it leaves a glowing light in the dark.   I also don't like that the default temperature is 400. That is very hot and requires me to turn it down to a lower temp *every single time* I turn it on.   Lastly, I find that I have to 'squeeze' the tongs together a bit more than I realize to get it to hold my hair -- I don't think you should have to 'squeeze' that hard for a tool that is literally meant to be pressed together.  \nAll in all, it's nice tool at a nice price point, but I'm still debating whether to return it or not (inside the return period).  I don't think I would buy it again.",
