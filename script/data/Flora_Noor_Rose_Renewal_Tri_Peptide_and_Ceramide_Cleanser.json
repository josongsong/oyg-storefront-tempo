I had a small dry patch on my jawline and decided to try out the Rose Renewal cleanser. I never used a Rose cleanser on my skin before so I was nervous that it would further irritate the dry patch but I was surprised. After cleansing my skin, not only was the dry patch much smoother but my entire face felt rehydrated. My skin didn't feel dried out but instead it felt clean. It also works into a nice lather so you don't need much more than a dime size amount in my opinion. My dry patch on my jaw cleared up after using it twice, morning and night, for two days. This cleanser is a working miracle!",

The consistency of the cleanser is thick, which I personally enjoy as it feels luxurious and nourishing on the skin. However, some may find it to be a bit too thick for their preference.\n\nOne issue I had with the cleanser was the pump. It was a bit hard to open and required some effort to dispense the product. This might be a minor inconvenience, but it could potentially be frustrating if you're in a rush and want quick and easy access to the cleanser.\nDespite the pump issue, the cleanser itself worked really well for me. It effectively removed dirt, impurities, and makeup from my face, leaving my skin feeling refreshed and clean. It has a subtle rose scent which I found to be pleasant and not overpowering.\nI enjoyed using this cleanser with the moisturizer from the same line. They seemed to work hand in hand to provide hydration and rejuvenation to my skin. The combination left my skin feeling soft and nourished.\nOverall, the Rose Renewal Cleanser is a great option for those looking for a thick and luxurious cleanser. Although the pump may present a slight issue, the effectiveness and pleasant scent of the cleanser, along with its compatibility with the moisturizer, make it a worthwhile purchase.",
