Because I have fine, thin-ish curly hair, I find that a lot of hair products can look good and hold my curls well at first but then fall after a while more dramatically. It's frustrating trying to find something that doesn't look greasy or ends up heavy on my curls. So this cream is a winner for me! Seems to hold in well after I rewet my curls a day later too.",

For context, I have very long, thick, coarse, dry wavy/curly hair, and most curl products don't mesh well with my texture — they either weigh it down or leave it looking frizzy.\n\nThis curl cream really surprised me. It defines my curls beautifully while still keeping them soft and natural. My hair looks so much better than usual, with smoother, more consistent curls, but without that heavy, crunchy feel some creams give.\n\nThe hold is very light — so if you're looking for something strong, this isn't the one. But for lightweight curl definition that makes hair look healthier, shinier, and more polished, it's perfect. I feel like it enhances my natural texture rather than trying to control it. I do wish it  had a bit of a better hold, but I still really like this.\n\nThis product was gifted to me by Moroccanoil, but these are my 100% honest thoughts. If it didn't work for me, I'd say so — but I truly love it, and it's going to stay in my curl routine.",

Unfortunately, this product did not work for her. She said it made her hair feel very dry. It surprised me a lot because other products by this brand have been nourishing for her hair. This just didn't work for her.",
