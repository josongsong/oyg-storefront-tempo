As soon as I used this product, the redness on my face started to fade away and the pain from the redness was instantly gone. It has a cooling effect that I love about it. My cheeks were not as inflamed and brought instant relief. The product was so simple to use, and came with a pair of tweezers so I wouldn't get the product all over the place. I noticed my skin was brighter, redness was practically gone after 2 uses, and my skin seemed softer and more supple. It did have a little sting to it when first applied to clean face, but it disappeared in seconds. It does have a sticky feel and you want to make sure it's blended in really well before gently wiping off with a  soft, cool wash cloth. I will definitely be recommending to my Lupus friends and my family.",

The Azelaic Acid 10 Hyaluron Redness Soothing Pads are a total game-changer for my skin. I struggle with sensitivity and redness, and from the very first use I noticed how calming and soothing they felt. The texture of the pads is soft and gentle—no harsh tugging or irritation—yet they deliver such effective results.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks, my skin looks more even-toned, less inflamed, and feels so much more hydrated. I really appreciate that the formula has hyaluronic acid, because it locks in moisture beautifully without feeling sticky or heavy. My skin feels refreshed, plump, and calm every time I use them.\n\nI love using them after cleansing as a quick treatment step, or even in the morning before makeup to help keep my skin balanced throughout the day. They're convenient, mess-free, and perfect for anyone dealing with redness, uneven texture, or sensitivity.\n\nHighly recommend—these are a must-have in my routine now! 🌸✨",

I loved using the Anua Redness Soothing Pads, they are super easy to use, convenient, and I can pair it with my LED red light therapy wand, so it makes it duo kind of skincare  product. I love how I see the difference in redness and inflammation the next morning! I enjoyed using this for both morning and night, but I really did see a significant difference when using in the night and then seeing the results in the morning. The pads come very saturated, so I know that there will be a good amount of product that gets applied to my face. I also really enjoy that the packaging and that it comes with tweezers to use to grab the pads, so that we are not cross contaminating the pads before application.

Alot of products that have claimed to help soothe just disguise the damage. As soon as I put these on I knew that these would do the opposite. The pad itself is super easy to stretch and all you really need is 3 to get the areas on your face atleast on my combination skin.The dryest part on my face is my cheeks and forehead. I really love the hylouronic acid and azaliec acid and I can feel them working to plump and restore my skin. I used these before putting on my make up and the redness would be gone within 10 minutes. These little patches feel like a cool aloe mask for your face. I am looking forward to keeping these in my beauty arsenal.\nThis product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review.",

Each pad is soaked with the perfect amount of product, As someone with fair, redness-prone skin who's in their 30s, l've tried my fair share of calming products — and I have to say, the Azelaic 10 Hyaluron Redness Soothing Pad truly impressed me. From the moment I opened the jar, I could tell this was a thoughtfully designed product. The included tweezers are a small but incredibly smart detail — they keep things hygienic and prevent me from digging into the jar with my fingers. I use them in the mornings to prep my skin, and they leave it feeling refreshed and hydrated. The azelaic acid helps to gently exfoliate and reduce redness, while hyaluronic acid locks in moisture. They're convenient, mess-free, and don't sting After just one use, my skin felt calm and plump - hydrated, but never greasy. It layers seamlessly under other products, making it an easy addition to my routine. Over the course of a couple of weeks, l've noticed a significant improvement in overall hydration and tone.

Each pad is soaked in just the right amount of essence—light, non-sticky, and super gentle on sensitive skin. The 10% azelaic acid helps target redness and texture, while the hyaluronic acid hydrates and soothes at the same time. I like to use them after cleansing to prep my skin before serums, and I've noticed they also help with mild breakouts and calming inflammation. They're not harsh at all, and my skin doesn't feel stripped afterward. In fact, it feels more balanced. These pads are perfect for anyone with reactive, acne-prone, or combination skin. They deliver results without irritation and are a quick, convenient way to add active ingredients into your routine. A must-have for busy days or when your skin needs a reset.",

It came with a pair of tongs which Is a very nice addition so that you don't have to reach in with your hands. Which helps prevent contamination and germs from getting on the rest of them. Each pad is well saturated with a generous amount. It comes with 90 pads! With the amount of serum/essence on each pad it can easily be used on your entire face. You can either let it sit for a while if you have time, or just swipe it across your face like a toner. I'm a huge fan of azelaic acid, and it also contains other calming ingredients like: madecassoside, centella, etc. so its very effective and also very fast acting at treating any redness or irritation. These have been a great addition to my skincare routine and I would definitely recommend them.",

I can see the redness go down visibly. My face feels clean as it swipes off all the dirt and oils from my face. I have used this prior to putting on makeup and it works really well under makeup too. It makes the skin soft and even. And is a good first step for skin prep. I wash my face and then on a clean dry face, I go in with the pads. I love that this has tweezers to grab the pads so it remains clean and hygienic. It feels very refreshing.",

The packaging itself did tend to leak for me when it fell sideways but that is something that can be avoided. The tweezers provided were an absolute pleasant surprise! They also fit perfectly inside the container. As for the product itself, they definitely put a lot of. The pads are absolutely soaked and there's even more liquid at the bottom (good thing!!). I've been using them on my problem areas when I need a refresh and they help bring my skin back to life. It works great for my sensitive skin and is super lux feeling. I'm not usually a face mask enjoyer because it takes too long and it's messy but this is the perfect after shower mask for a quick fix!!

Many tend to overdo it, leaving skin stripped, tight, or worse, inflamed. That's why I was so pleasantly surprised by the Anua Azelaic 10 Hyaluron Redness Soothing Pads. They offer a rare combination of mild exfoliation, calming ingredients, and lightweight hydration- all in one swipe. From the first use, I noticed how soft, saturated, and non-abrasive the pads were. There's no stinging, no drying alcohol scent, and no tacky finish- just a light, watery essence that absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and soothed. I've used them daily in the mornings for a few weeks now, and they consistently calm down my cheeks and reduce the appearance of redness around my nose.

As an acne probe girly, everything out there feels so gimmicky but the anua Azelaic acid and heartless products (green packaging) have been such a win for me. I'm so happy that they came out with these toner pads too- first of all. Hello the innovation?? They stretch so well, it's so easy to apply in your face and cover the areas you want, I enjoy using these so much. Secondly, they combined the best serum ever into these pads and it has worked great for me to leave on for 10-15 minutes while working on other things as an intensive treatment. I use these about 2-3 times a week and use the serum as well almost daily, it has made such a difference in the redness I experience and the amount of breakouts I get. If you're an acne prone girly like me- I highly reccomend trying these out, so happy that Ulta carries it now!",

        "comments": "As a beauty enthusiast, I was so thrilled to try the  ANUAAzelaic 10 Hyaluron Redness Soothing Pad .The packaging embodied hydration, relaxation and soothing! I feel like this product definitely delivered all of the above. First notice the packaging was clear with directions that were simple to follow. Using the soothing was easy and it absorbed nicely. The scent was mild and non irritating which was nice. I allowed the product to sit and then rubbed in the excess after slotted time frame. My face notable was less red and more plump appearing. Paired with the rest of this skincare line my skin has seemed to start a transformation with the redness and collagen retention. I have told several friends and peers about this and will continue to do so!",

        "comments": "I wasn't expecting much from these at first, but they've completely changed the way I treat redness and sensitivity on flare-up days. These pads are soaked in a gentle, hydrating essence that feels instantly cooling when applied — like a mini treatment mask for stressed skin. What makes them special is how they cling perfectly to areas like my cheeks without sliding off, making them perfect for targeted calming.\n\nEach pad is super soft and stretchy (not rough or scratchy like some others), and the formula is powered by 10% azelaic acid and 3 types of hyaluronic acid. I use them after cleansing and leave them on for a few minutes before patting in the extra essence, and I always notice less visible redness by the next step of my routine. They've become a staple for when my skin feels warm, reactive, or just plain tired.",

        "comments": "I was skeptical when I first recieved these pads to review. I had never tried anything like them before and I'm still fairly new to the Korean skincare trend and so it was an interesting experience figuring out how to use this product and how to best benefit from it. I read the instructions and found a few videos and ended up just relaxing with 2 on my cheeks and one on my forehead. Wow these things are amazing. I love how cooling they are and they leave my skin feeling so refreshed. I like that they're packed full of product so you can use the extra liquid on your face and neck after so that you dont waste a single drop of this. The included tweezers are cute but difficult to use with the pads because they are thin and stick together but I appreciate them going out of their way to include a tool to keep their product hygenic. Overall I really like these skincare pads and I look forward to using them more and becoming more comfortable and knowledgeable about Korean skincare. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.",

        "comments": "As someone with fair, redness-prone skin who's just entered their 30s, I've tried my fair share of calming products — and I have to say, the Azelaic 10 Hyaluron Redness Soothing Pad truly impressed me.\n\nFrom the moment I opened the jar, I could tell this was a thoughtfully designed product. The included tweezers are a small but incredibly smart detail — they keep things hygienic and prevent me from digging into the jar with my fingers. Major bonus points there!\n\nThe pads themselves are larger than I expected and absolutely drenched in product — no skimping here. I gently sweep one across my face for several minutes, and because there's so much product, I'm able to extend application down my neck as well. Despite how much product is on each pad, it never feels sticky or heavy. In fact, my skin immediately feels soft, soothed, and hydrated after use.\n\nOne of my favorite features? It's completely fragrance-free, which is perfect for sensitive skin like mine. I often react poorly to scented skincare, but with this, I had zero irritation.\n\nThe real magic, though, is in the results. After just one use, my skin felt calm and plump — hydrated, but never greasy. It layers seamlessly under other products, making it an easy addition to my routine. Over the course of a couple of weeks, I've noticed a significant improvement in overall hydration and tone. The redness around my nose and chin (my usual dry, irritated spots) has decreased noticeably. Plus, I'm using far less moisturizer than before, which really speaks to how well this product locks in hydration.\n\nEvery morning after use, my skin feels refreshed, calm, and not weighed down — just healthy and balanced. That, paired with the generous saturation of each pad and the thoughtful packaging, makes this an incredible value. I truly think this is a must-have for anyone dealing with dry, red, or sensitized skin who's looking for a little extra TLC.\nThis product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review",

        "comments": "The ANUA Azelaic Acid 10 Hyaluron Redness Soothing Pad is gentle pad designed to reduce redness prone skin and calm sensitized skin. The pad itself lightly green tinted no fragrance. And a thin round that is soft textured. I felt no abrasiveness in feel when I used this in a more mechanical fashion. I have sensitive acne prone skin with bouts of eczema so I definitely don't say that lightly. I generally don't prefer to rub anything on my face with an item so I just used this entirely as a blemish pad treatment. It is decently saturated. Less so in the top due to the product design. But like I said I didn't use this as typical, sans my first try, so I was fine with less product. My problem did lie in the fact this felt like it gave me acne, my period recently ended so I know that influences things. Still I got little comedonal acne on my cheeks which definitely wasn't my hormonal acne. Soothing wise I liked how my skin looked like it got glass skin adjacent in the spots I dropped this on. My skin was mostly calm looking besides the fact my comedonal acne did get triggered. This wasn't amazing but I do think if it can be beneficial for redness non-acne prone people. But it's not necessary for a routine. The extracts can make this volatile so patch test 100%. This product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review.",
