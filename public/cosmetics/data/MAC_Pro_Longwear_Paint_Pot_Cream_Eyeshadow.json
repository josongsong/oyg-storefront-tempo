I've been on the hunt for something that evens out my lids and also stays put. I've tried other Mac paint pots but not painterly before now, I always thought it would be too pink on my skin tone (currently using ilia stick foundation 16N). the pinkish color is perfect for camouflaging the blue of the veins. I don't prefer the color by itself but it acts as a perfect primer for whatever powder I lay on top. I apply with an it cosmetics eyeshadow brush, a thin layer all over my lids. it's perfect for an easy, low maintenance everyday look for work!",

        "comments": "So, first and foremost: nothing will be 100% crease proof against 90 degree days in an arid state if you have oily eyelids. BUT, this on top of a primer and beneath my shadows, if I let it fully dry, will get me through a work day. I usually hit 5PM and I'm creasing, but this little guy does let me last until that 5:00 marker with my primer and shadows. I let it dry down and it works super well as a tacky base for my shadows to cling onto. \n\nI would recommend this in a shade close to your skin as a base or a primer for shadows if you have oily lids like me, hi hello. It works great. Not foolproof, but well worth the price in the hot weather with minimal touching up required to stop creasing or other wear.",

It wasn't till I tried the shade Painterly, however, that the product's full potential was revealed. I now use that shade as my only eyelid primer. It creates a smooth base that hides any unwanted pigmentation or imperfections and helps all eyeshadow stick and be more vibrant. It works better than other eyelid primers and even has a third effect as a under-eye concealer (not it's best function mind you, but in a pinch it gets the job done).",

        "comments": "I purchased three of these a couple of weeks ago after having previously tried some colors. Overall here is the review of each color I have:\nPainterly- Good basic eye base or for those days when you want bare but not red eyelids. It has no sparkle but doesn't give a matte dry look. Works well under other powder eyeshadow as it is a true neutral.\nConstructivist- Great brown color that goes on beautifully with a finger tip and less so with a brush. This is the color that caused me to experiment with these things instead of powder eyeshadow. Good Brown, not red, not muddy. With sheen but not annoyingly sparkly\nVintage Selection- Kind of reminds me of All that Glitters; this paint pot has a sheer finish with gleam, not sparkles. I use this on its own, or as the base with a layer of anything else. I like this, the color is more Champagne, but not too pink or yellow- once again right in the middle.\nFrozen Violet- While I like the color is is so sparkly someone that sees me everyday commented on it. The color is a medium, sheer plum, but once again, it has those sparkles that you cannot seem to get off your face everywhere you touch.\nI ordered all of these (except the Constructivist- which I guess was limited series) off the MAC Pro website. So I did take a risk, but oh well. I would say NONE of the colors have a coverage that is like a matte- say Blanc Type, but if you are a natural girl they should work okay for you and of course you can layer. Just beware these do set fairly quickly. I find a fingertip application gives the nicest result. The synthetic brushes I have for some reason I hold on to the color and it applies unevenly.\nGood Luck!\nAlso, I want to say I have been purchasing MAC since they first came to the US with Nordstrom (1989).",
