My only reason for not 5 stars is the scent/flavor is very light plus the product last about an hour on be before I need to reapply. \n\nThe price is reasonable for this type of product and i would definitely recommend to those that don't like a heavy flavored lip gloss or if you have a coupon that can be applied to it. \n\nIt's a safe blind buy as well.I purchased the vanilla caramel flavor.",

I got the vanilla caramel scent. It smells delicious and beachy and feels good when on, but when it wears off (and that does not take long), my lips are dry as ever and feel dehydrated, as if I had not put anything on. Maybe this would be good on top of something else, but as the only hydrating product, it is useless. The Kylie lip scrub has a really thick vaseline-like base that hydrates pretty nicely - I'd suggest that instead.",

        "comments": "The Kylie Skin Lip Butter in Vanilla Caramel has a few things going for it, especially compared to my usual favorite, the Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm. The pop-off cap is more convenient than a twist-off and stays cleaner in my bag, which I really appreciate.\n\nThe applicator is rounded instead of angled, and while it doesn't hug the lips the same way, I actually find it easier to apply. It feels smooth going on and creates less of a mess overall.\n\nThe Vanilla Caramel scent is subtle and not overwhelming, which I prefer. You get a light hint of sweetness without it being too strong.\n\nTexture-wise, this lip butter is thinner and more lightweight than Summer Fridays. It gives a really shiny finish and looks great on, but it's not as moisturizing. I notice I need to reapply it more often, and it doesn't give that same long-lasting hydration. It's also untinted, which works if you're going for a natural look.\n\nOverall, it's a nice everyday option if you're looking for shine and a soft scent, but it doesn't quite replace my go-to when it comes to serious hydration.",
