The instructions say to press harder to fill in the brows of dark brown or black users. If you do that, the end result isn't natural at all! Even using the eyebrow brush smudger doesn't make it look natural. It takes off the color. It also gives your dk brown brows an \"ashey\" tone. The harder you press to create a darker color, the more you look like a \"painted lady\". You know those ladies...the \"drawn on eyebrow\" look. I would only recommend this product for users with light brown eyebrow hair.",
