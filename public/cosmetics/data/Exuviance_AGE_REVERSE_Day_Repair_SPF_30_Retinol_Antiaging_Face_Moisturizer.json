This sun damage on my face is pretty noticeable for my age considering that I already have dark age spots. I wasn't sure if this cream would work for me or not. I went ahead and got it because I am pretty desperate to reverse the signs of aging on my skin. After a few weeks of use, I noticed that my fine lines were disappearing and my age spots were lightening up pretty dramatically. I think it's safe to say that this product is making a big difference in my skin! I cannot wait to see what continued use will do for me!",

It left my skin looking oily as soon as I put it on and throughout the day my face would be greasier and shinier than usual. It moisturizes well and you don't need to use much, but there weren't any other noticeable benefits after using this for several months. I don't feel it's worth the price. I'll finish the tube but will be trying a different product when it's gone.",
