My hair is fine and can be weighed down easily but Perfecting Leave-In is not heavy on my hair. Also I have to fight frizz and this calms the frizz into shiny locks of hair. I use it at bedtime to condition my hair overnight. Then I use it mornings to style my  hair for the day. Generally I apply it to dry hair and only to the ends.",

        "comments": "I have curly/wavy, VERY fine hair. I've been growing out my platinum-white-blonde pixie for about 9 mos now & my hair is now about midway down my neck.  It's much healthier (w/reg trims & no more bleach or straightening). However I'm also dealing w/thinning (hormonal/menopause). But since the grow out ive been seeing new growth at the roots & especially around the hairline (def bcz of breakage while platinum). So this adds to my existing frizzy nightmare😩. When  I was platinum pixie, id blow dry & straighten which concealed the issues i have now). But OMG😩 since growing it out, my hair has bn a frizzy tragic nightmare lol! So to assist, I take a hair supplement, along w/regular hair/scalp treatments & hair growth shampoo/conditioner, all of which continues to help but ive bn searching for the right combo - a leave-in cond. for fine, thin, curly, frizzy hair along w/a strong hold volumizing gel/mousse (something that wont make curls stringy), but i'd been failing miserably,  I hadn't found ANYTHING that controls frizz at the root (esp w/curly new growth at hairline). The leave-ins were either completely ineffective at the roots or were too heavy- which, in turn would, override the hold & curl cast that a gel or mousse creates ehen you sir dry. Thus is necessary to hold/maintain curl pattern after styling. But extreme frizz at the root was an ongoing issue w/no solution yet (deeeep sigh😞). So during the endless quest in a very over saturated market of hair products, i FINALLY came across this! I read A LOT of 3rd party reviews & was impressed enough to try it. After all the time, money & failed products, it was nice to see that I could try this brand w/o having to blindly dump another $30-$40 on ANOTHER leave in cond. bcz they offered small sizes👍. \nI tried this for the 1st time yesterday & after testing so many others, i began to learn a lot about this type of product even before i put it in my hair. The consistency of this & how it emulsified & felt in hands told me this was different & could tell i was about to have a different experience. So once you pump & emulsify (VERY IMPORTANT), youll notice you DONT NEED MUCH - a little goes a long way. I can see this easily being over applied. But I applied to my VERY WET curls (yes even the roots) & you would not believe what a bless-ed relief it was when i began to see my curls pulling & clumping together naturally & w/o manipulating them. My natural curl formation came together & was actually SMOOTH FROM ROOT TO TIP! No more frizz at the roots? Well seeing this happen SO EASILY was a very promising start! I never thought id say this about something as boring as a leave in conditioner, but this has truly been a unique experience with this truly unique & beautiful formula! And i feel like the reason my curls formed in tgat smooth frizz free way (from root to tip) is bcz the formula has like this very nice slip to it. So when im initially brushing my very wet, curly-hair, that slip helps the hair cuticle to smooth as the curl forms. This is the 1st time during my grow out that my curls weren't stringy. So I applied a 2nd product (for hold), this gel serum consistency by Joico, that too has a slip to it too which isnt a common thing in my experience in a gel-type product. It adds volume to thin/fine hair. After its 100% air dried, i break up the dry cast on my curls caused by the gel, fluff n style n soray & i had a greathair day! All thanks to this awesome leave in by Lolavie!💜💙\nToday will be my 2nd day curls. I predict another great hair day!",

        "comments": "I'm a keraste and Aveda long term customer but always interested in what's new out there. I bought the sample size of the shampoo, conditioner, detangler, leave in perfected and hair brush.         Compared to the two brands mentioned above, the scent was not exceptional and even barely there. Too light for my preference.         The shampoo lathering was average. No feeling of richness like my favorite brands. I also needed more to really feel like I was cleaning/conditioning my hair. Again, no great scent.         Conditioner was disappointing. Didn't feel it was rich enough for the regular size price point nor did I get the impression it was costing each lock. When rinsing out, I could tell I was going to need the detangler because the rinse-out wasn't smooth and there were snags.         The perfecting leave-in was ok. It wasn't result-obvious and didn't leave an apparent after scent.         I'm sorry for leaving this non positive review as I really wanted to like it. The minimalist packaging was lovely and the product name very classy. I'm glad I tried it at the sample size which I believe was a smart way to offer the product to customers. For what it's worth, I did like the brush very much.",
