        "comments": "Honestly, found this product through TikTok. Rep purchased it twice. Loved it at the beginning. However, now I'd see that it's not very long lasting. I put it on in the morning and then by the time I get off of work, go to the gym it still sticks, but i guess a more accurate word would be it clumps my baby hairs together so they are still sticking up but just now in clumps. Also washing it off doesn't happen over night you need to wash your hairs, at least two days consecutively without using the product. Smells fresh though.",

This product is ok. It feels like waxing on my head but does the job to hold my hair up for an hour or two until I have to reapply it again. I'm assuming it's because my hair is thick and heavy so it doesn't stick as well. I used this during a concert and it isn't sweatproof nor does it last for the whole day. I would probably use this for the days when I'm not out the entire time.",

The instructions actually suggest rubbing the stick in circles directly on short hair...huge mistake since this applies way too much product to a pixie. I rubbed my fingers over the stick and \"pinched\" it onto the ends then ran my fingers trough to style. This stuff does not wash off your hands well (still had waxy residue after 3 washes). My style looked good at first...piecey texture that was not stiff or greasy. By the end of the day my hair was flat and felt dirty/greasy. I could restyle but it quickly fell flat.\n\nBasically, this product is like the others I have tried but with a higher price tag. Still in search of a texturing product for my fine, straight hair that wont turn it into a greasy mess or leave my hair plastered by my head. I can see the advantages of this product for other hair types but not fine short hair.",
