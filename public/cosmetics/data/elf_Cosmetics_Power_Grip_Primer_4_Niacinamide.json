I feel like the stickyness of the product is more gimmicky than helpful, and I find that a lot of my makeup (especially blush and bronzer) has a hard time laying down correctly with this product. It does however have a really nice cooling effect that I enjoy. This product has also caused me to have worse breakouts in hot weather, and I feel like its caused my pores to be a little more visible over time as a result of using. Just not for me.",

I had a hard time getting it to work and was experiencing my makeup sliding around and breaking up around my nose and creasing. I recently learned I was applying way too much skincare for this primer to be effective. Now, all I do is a hydrating toner, SPF, and then I go in with this primer before I start my makeup and it works like a dream. It keeps my makeup intact all day long, and my makeup looks good even after sweaty gym sessions. My advice if you feel like this product is working against you is to use minimal skincare beforehand, but making sure whatever skincare you do use is still hydrating. I genuinely love this primer now and it will definitely be a staple from here on out.",

        "comments": "I have combo skin. After applying the e.l.f. Cosmetics Power Grip Primer + 4% Niacinamide and waiting a minute, I applied my foundation, Estée Lauder Futurist Hydra Rescue Moisturizing Foundation SPF 45. I usually have make up break up around my nose so I had high hopes for this primer. I noticed how tacky the primer was so I knew I had to work quickly with my foundation. UGH! It gave me the worst coverage and accentuated every pore. It made my skin look horrible! \"I couldn't wait to take off my make up,\" bad. It also made my foundation look splotchy because it gripped in a bad way. I looked at my nose hoping at least that should be good. Unfortunately, the foundation still broke up on my nose. Not happy with this primer at all. \n\nMaybe I'll just add more hydration to my face prior to the primer? Well it tried that the  following day, hoping to still make it workable. Alas, it's the primer...not me and my application.",
