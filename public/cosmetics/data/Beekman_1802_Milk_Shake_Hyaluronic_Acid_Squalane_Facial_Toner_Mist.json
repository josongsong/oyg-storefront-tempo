I also noticed that my skin was getting extremely parched, like my skin wasn't getting moisturized, resulting in rough, dry skin.  What I think is happening is that the oil is creating a barrier, and using it as a toner (first step after cleaning) is working against me. \n\nSOOOOOO, I've skimmed the oil off the top as much as possible into a separate bottle, and I'm going to use THAT as my last step after treatments and moisturizer. Overall I like that there's very little scent, and the toner is gentle and light.  It leaves your skin velvety and pores seem to look smaller.  I generally don't like sprays because the liquid gets all over, but I do agree that the mist is very fine and ideal for the face.  I may upcycle the bottle for other toners after the contents are done.  Probably will not purchase again, but not all is lost here.",
