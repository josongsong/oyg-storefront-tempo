        "comments": "The Hairdresser's Invisible Oil Heat/UV Protective Primer works well for my straight, thick \"Asian\" hair (unlike Bond-Building Repair Hair Oil Serum, which did nothing but deposit gunky residue in my hair). It moisturized and softened my hair amazingly, added shine and helped it be more manageable/styleable, as well as appearing to help protect it from blow drying (but I don't use high heat or extensive blow drying time). \n\nAs a heat protectant, I strongly prefer this over some of the alcohol-based sprays that always dry out my hair and make it feel damaged.\n\nIt also does not have a strong scent which is nice for someone like me who is sensitive and allergic to fragrances. (The scent is barely detectable. It is mild, pleasant and inoffensive.)\n\nI usually use a bunch of different leave-in products after washing my hair -- to soften, to condition/moisturize, to add shine, \"bond repair,\" help hold style, protect from heat, etc. -- but I think this one takes care of all of those. I'll repurchase this for sure.",

Here's my assessment:\n\nIf I wear my hair wavy (scrunch out of the shower with the usual styling cream and setting spray and allow to dry naturally), the primer actually works SO well that it gets rid of a lot of my volume, so I don't use it anymore for wavy days. However, on day two of my messy/wavy bed-head look, the oil is great for killing frizz & making my unbrushed hair look sexy vs looking like a disaster. I don't wash my hair every day, so a fresh look for day two is frequently a challenge.\n\nOn blow dry and style days, the primer & oil combo are excellent - My hair blow drys quickly and is silky smooth. It actually seems to hold a curl better too - even through the night and into the next day (with no other styling products). I am able to brush out my 1 1/2\" curls from the day before, apply 1 pump of invisible oil to kill bed head frizz, and my style is fresh again. I'm amazed - seriously.",
