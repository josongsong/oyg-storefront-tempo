This product has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine, and I can't say enough good things about it. From the first use, I could feel the difference in the texture of my skin—it became so much smoother and more plump. The cream itself is rich and luxurious without feeling heavy, and it absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling hydrated and nourished.\nWhat really impressed me is how it's formulated with powerful ingredients like peptides, niacinamide, and collagen, which work together to visibly firm and rejuvenate my skin. I've noticed that my skin looks more toned and has a healthier, youthful glow since incorporating this cream into my routine. The niacinamide helps even out my skin tone, while the collagen boosts elasticity, making my skin feel firmer and more supple.\nThe scent is subtle and pleasant, which I really appreciate because I'm sensitive to strong fragrances. After using it consistently, I can honestly say my skin feels more resilient and revitalized. I also love that it's suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin, and it doesn't cause any irritation or breakouts for me, which is a huge win.\nThe packaging is sleek and simple, and the jar has a nice, sturdy feel to it. A little goes a long way, so this jar lasts a decent amount of time, making it well worth the price. If you're looking for a cream that firms, hydrates, and rejuvenates with a blend of effective ingredients, I highly recommend giving this a try. It has made such a difference in my skin's appearance and texture, and I'm definitely repurchasing!",

This time however I had a terrible reaction. I noticed a burning sensation. A couple of hours later, my cheeks were red, hot to touch, and had a horrible raised rash. It looked like my face was swollen and had fluid under my cheeks. I took medications that night for relief. The next morning I woke up with facial swelling and the fluid had moved into my eyes. I went to the doctor and had to get treated with a steroid injection and was placed on oral steroids for relief. It is as if the formula was changed which is very unfortunate.",
