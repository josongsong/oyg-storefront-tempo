        "comments": "This tinted spf moisturizer is the absomute GOAT. I recently found out about it after an aesthetician recommended it. I have dry skin, and this is incredibly hydrating without leaving a greasy residue that never sinks in. I still set it with powder in my T-zone, and still have the healthiest lit-from-within glow. I have bever received so many compliments on my skin and makeup in my life since I began wearing this. What I love is that it's not just makeup, but skincare. The tint is pretty good too, it evens out my skin tone and adds a healthy radiance. I've tried tons of tinted spf's and moisturizers throughout the years, and this one tops every single one. I went and repurchased a couple more for fear of them discontinuing it and being left without it. The only thing I woukd recommend is getting the lightest color even if you have a medium skin tone. I went with medium the first time, but it is a little too deep for me, so I use the light now and just mix a pump or two of the medium in to match my tone. Other than that, it's literally perfect!",

Tinted sunscreen usually has that problem so I think that's an important feature. The coverage is closer to sheer which also makes it easier to use the right amount so by the time I use enough I get enough coverage. I don't have to use much else.  it is dewy and I'm not always a fan of that look so beware.",

I have light medium skin so I grabbed the Medium shade. It is only wearable, due to how orange it becomes, when I dilute it with copius amounts of moisturizer.

It normally absorbs moisturizers immediately but this one makes me feel oily all day. I normally use a small amount of setting powder in my t-zone just to help blur my pores a bit. I tried using setting powder and setting spray and they helped a bit but not enough. I'm going to set it aside for the summer and see if it works better for me in the winter when there's less humidity as my face normally gets dryer that time of year.

        "comments": "This tinted spf moisturizer is the absomute GOAT. I recently found out about it after an aesthetician recommended it. I have dry skin, and this is incredibly hydrating without leaving a greasy residue that never sinks in. I still set it with powder in my T-zone, and still have the healthiest lit-from-within glow. I have bever received so many compliments on my skin and makeup in my life since I began wearing this. What I love is that it's not just makeup, but skincare. The tint is pretty good too, it evens out my skin tone and adds a healthy radiance. I've tried tons of tinted spf's and moisturizers throughout the years, and this one tops every single one. I went and repurchased a couple more for fear of them discontinuing it and being left without it. The only thing I woukd recommend is getting the lightest color even if you have a medium skin tone. I went with medium the first time, but it is a little too deep for me, so I use the light now and just mix a pump or two of the medium in to match my tone. Other than that, it's literally perfect!",

        "comments": "I wanted to love this because the brand has so many winners, but the chemical sunscreen filters stung my eyes so badly I had to wash it off - I'm talking bloodshot eyes and runny nose. I tried it for two days and both times it was unbearable. If this is a tinted product anyway, why not use mineral filters that don't irritate the eyes?\n\nOn the color: my skin is light (Cream in the Merit concealer if that helps), not fair or tan - true light. Out of the pump the shade Light looks beige, but as i was blending it into my face I watched it turn orange in real time. After using the capful recommended I looked like Trump, like the victim of a botched spray tan. The color was patchy and uneven and completely different from the color shown in pictures. \n\nI thought this would be the winter time answer to my favorite DRMTLGY tinted sunscreen which is less dewy and rich, and it did feel hydrating and nice on the skin, but ultimately I have to return.",
