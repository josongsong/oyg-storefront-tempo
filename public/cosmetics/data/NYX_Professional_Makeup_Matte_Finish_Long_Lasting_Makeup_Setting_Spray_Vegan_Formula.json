This setting spray does give a slightly dewy finish and helps make my makeup last all day if I spray it before and after application. The spray nozzle itself is not to strong and not to light. There is no strong scent which is great for my sensitive skin. I would repurchase again and again especially for the price!",

I wear makeup because 1) I love it and 2) I have bad acne scarring and don't feel confident without covering it up. With that said I like my makeup to look natural--like I'm wearing some but not overly made up or cakey or plastic. With the exception of my oily nose my skin looks/feels neither oily or dry so I like to look smooth, soft with just the right sheen after makeup. This setting spray is what I have been missing in my makeup routine! I keep mine in the fridge because the coolness is so refreshing and keeps my pores nice and tight. It leaves your skin with a nice subtle glow and I have noticed a true difference in the staying power of my makeup. I don't wear anything on my nose because I constantly blow it all day, and sometimes I would see foundation wearing off in that area. With this spray it has definitely lessened! Hardly any wearing off at all. I don't like to be matte so I haven't tried that one but if it works as well as the dewy finish its a good buy.",
