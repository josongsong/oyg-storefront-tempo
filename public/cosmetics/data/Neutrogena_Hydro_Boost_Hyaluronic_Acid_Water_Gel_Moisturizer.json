I thought maybe it was just me plus i didnt want to just waste it so i let my daughter try it out as she is starting to get in her skincare ErA. Left her skin burning and was visibly red after one use. Unfortunately, i had to throw away. I love Neutrogena so i really expected better. I still think theyre a good brand.",

This product does not break me out, moisturizes well, leaves my skin feeling smooth, has a cooling effect immediately upon application, and has a very smooth and lightweight texture/feel. However, on nights when I use my benzoyl peroxide + adalpalene topical cream, the moisturizer stings my face and lacks moisturizing benefits (most likely because of the fragrance and effects of spot treatment). I overall love this product, I just wish it didn't have fragrance (does smell really good though)! Will continue to buy, as it has really helped with my acne!",

        "comments": "I have normal to combo skin. When I was younger I would break out in hormonal cysts on my chin that would last for months. Scarring is an issue. This product works so well to hydrate my skin. I can instantly see the difference, my skin just drinks this up.  Perfectly absorbs instantly so my foundation goes on and stays on... doesn't melt off because this product is non greasy yet works all day and night until you wash it off. This is truly a product that I have and will continue to recommend. I am in my mid 40's with signs of aging. Deep wrinkles under my eyes and around my mouth. I have considered using botox and fillers but once I apply this Moisturizer gel into my skin the idea to go and to pay someone to stick needles with expensive ingredients in my face tends to cease. Put this morning and night and watch the compliments roll in... Take a selfie of a before and after and see what I mean. I would become a brand ambassador solely on my experience with this product... but I use many others of theirs too. And I am very, very happy with the results. I will not use any other moisturizer after this... the price is perfect but even more so is that it works. My skin is plump, dewy and hydrated. I look a lot younger and when my skin is leached of moisture from sun exposure or just overwork or stress. This gel is my go to miracle to help me feel like money and time well spent. Thank you.",

        "comments": "I used this product for two months morning and night. While I was using this product I started to get terrible acne. Cystic and large white heads all over my cheeks, chin, and sometimes forehead. I had acne as a teenager(I'm 23) so I thought I was just having a reoccurring stint, until I ran out of the gel and didn't have time to buy more.  My skin started to clear up in a week in a half. I had no idea it was wrecking my skin. I looked up reviews after I noticed a difference and other users had the same problem. I hoped the gel would not create acne, but it did not work. Do not recommend.",
