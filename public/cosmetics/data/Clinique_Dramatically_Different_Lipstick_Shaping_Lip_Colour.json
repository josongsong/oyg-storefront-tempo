        "comments": "After visiting 2 store clinique counters to get assistance on colors,  I eventually purchased Dramatically Different lipstick in Surprise online which the Consultant in the store who tested it on my hand assured me would be a good color. When I tried it on my lips after receiving my product in the mail, it was barely noticeable- no color. Again, so disappointed  as I asked the Consultant if it would be a noticeable color and was assured it would be. The creamy center, although  moisturizing, is not an improvement as there's just less lipstick color. Also I was advised this would last 8 hours and not come off. It lasted barely a couple hours and that was with no eating, drinking, etc. I have not had a problem with other brands just disappearing and fading away to nothing. I used to wear SASSY SPICE. Ever since that was discontinued I've searched for a suitable replacement.  Different consultants have advised me to use Shy, Surprise, Merlot and several other colors. They said each would be close but none of them have been. I'm continually just disappointed.  The good news is I was smart enough to try this color immediately upon receiving and call immediately to request a return which I just completed. I was approved to return the product and get a refund.  But I still have no lipstick! Please bring back SASSY SPICE. Please if there really is a replacement for it, let me know what it is, and maybe make a chart available when colors are being discontinued so advisors and customers know what an option is. I like Clinique products in general but the lipstick is just too hard these days. Also, in my locality, the delivery company is Ontrac and they are terrible with mis deliveries.  I've called before and let you know but there's been no change. My package has been noted as delivered days before it shows up at my door, left down the street and most recentlythe packagingit arrived in was stained, smelly and torn. Please use another carrier.Thanks for listening.",
