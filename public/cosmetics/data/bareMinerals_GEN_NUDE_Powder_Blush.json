        "comments": "Gen Nude-On The Mauve color appears to have changed, so be aware if you are shopping based on the store display units.  Two Ulta locations near me had the old version displayed while they are selling the current version (one of the stores had the correct version alongside the old version).  The prior version has more warm/brown in it than the newer one, which is more of a neutral dark pink/soft raspberry.  I have a hard time buying blush because most colors I try either are too warm/orange, are too deep/red, or are too pastel for my light-medium warm olive skin.  On The Mauve works for me as a neutral everyday blush--as long as I apply it with a light touch.  The product texture is just right--soft enough for color pickup on my brush, yet not so soft as to make a mess of the packaging.  Since buying this, I haven't reached for any of my other blushes and will probably pare down to just this and my wintertime favorite (Fenty Raisin Standardz, a dusky blackberry jam, also applied with a light touch).",

You don't need much, as it has super pigment and lasts all day. The first day I wore it, I received a compliment saying how 'fresh' I looked. Win! I imagine this color is great on all skin tones because of the pigment. I also have Pretty in Pink, and that's a great spring/summer color.

I've looked at these blushes in store previously and almost purchased before but always held off for some reason. Glad I waited and got them on sale! These blushes are semi sheer with a light application, but are buildable to more intense color payoff if desired. Both shades I got are matte, but they don't look flat or dry or dusty on the face, instead they look skin like and healthy. I especially like but first coffee (the rosy brown shade) which probably looks intimidating as a blush for light skin tones. But it's more subtle and blendable on the cheeks than you might think. It's not like a bronzer shade, it's definitely blush but it's really natural rosy brown that is pretty and dimensional on your skin. Strike a rose is more vibrant, and not quite what I think of as a rose shade. It's more terracotta rose than pink rose. It's very pretty though and I think I will get more use from this shade in the summer when I have more of a tan. Overall, these are both great shades and the formula is buildable, blendable, and long lasting. I like this formula for powder blush quite a bit!",

No on both counts. Ready blush blended beautifully and lasted all day. Gen Nude (which comes with no applicator) doesn't blend well regardless of what applicator I use, and doesn't last more than 4 hours Color is more bright rather than a subtle mauve.. I tried to stay with it, but really hated the difference. Last week I found an unopened  Ready Blush Indecent Proposal I'd forgotten I had. What an improvement. I won't use this product again. Am actively looking for a new blush from elsewhere to be my choice when the Ready Blush is gone.  I've used Bare Minerals for 12 years. This is the second time in a year that a product I loved was discontinued and the remaining or new options are unsatisfactory. You're losing me Bare Minerals.",
