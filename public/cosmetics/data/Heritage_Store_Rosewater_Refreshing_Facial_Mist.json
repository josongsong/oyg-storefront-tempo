I've been searching for a nice facial mist for a while now and this is so cheap but it checks all my boxes! It's nice in the morning before I apply any makeup and to set it. I also use a spritz throughout the day if I feel dry or start to get greasy. It seems to help w my oily skin and moisturize my dry areas at the same time. I also use it in my hair on my dry ends, my baby fine hair will get greasy if I use too many products and this is just enough to help w fly aways. The fact that it's crazy cheap and natural and cruelty free but also WORKS is almost unheard of. The rose scent is there but it's not over powering and it fades quickly, I hate rose scented products but this is so nice that the few minutes of it before it fades are not an issue for me",

I cannot use essential oils an fragrances because if they do not break me out immediately, they make my skin more sensitive over time. Do not trust the names read the labels.\n\nReal rosewater is a single ingredient and very gentle on the skin. Ive used it for a decade and regret switching to this. \n\nLadies (and gents), just go to your middle eastern market and buy a liter of REAL rosewater for $3, and buy a spray bottle for $1.",
