It would also be nicer if things would expand and the print was just a little bit larger. So I don't have to get out my reading glasses after I got my cataract surgery done. I've been using Clinique since I've been a teenager. So I'm not the only one that has a problem with the print being too light or too small. And is it really that hard to give a better description? I see people were asking if the finish was matte.  Seriously you're putting together information online, and every minor detail matters on whether or not I choose your product or somebody else's",

The colors are very soft and need a good primer to show up well. I layer mine on a brown base and they are light and soft enough to give me a blended clean look. However, I was hoping for them to be as shimmery as pictured. This has made me leery of ordering from Clinique again.

The off white can be a great under brow or all over base. The light tan shade is identical to my eyelid color...a totally nude flesh tone. The taupe shade is a light grey brown and is very pretty in the crease or even under the eye as a liner. The darkest shade is a warm coffee brown that I totally use as my upper eye lid liner alone most of the time or with my quick-liner by Clinique in dark chocolate.\nI use brushes for application and the powder glides on nicely, very smooth application.\nI don't use a primer and the eye shadow holds up for a good 8 hours easily.\nI think what I love the most is that the colors are matte. Frosted shimmering shades really age the eye, these shades just look natural and warm and youthful, doing what eye shadow is meant to do: accentuate the eyes, not the eyeshadow you're wearing or eye wrinkles!",

Why change something that works so well? These eyeshadows don't work any better than the drugstore brands which I may as well buy and save a lot of money. Clinique, you blew it. Your eyeshadows were one of your best items. You've lost an eyeshadow customer.",
