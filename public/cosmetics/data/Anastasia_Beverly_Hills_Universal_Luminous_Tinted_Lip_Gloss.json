Cotton Candy is a MUST! Cantalope is a must! The glitter ones are a tad thinner in concistancy. I pray they dont discontinue these ever! I can not stand oily thin glosses that slide right off the lips and does not last more than 20 minutes! Get these! Their sooo good and to me under rated!",

This lip gloss is very smooth and not sticky like some glosses.  It's also very pigmented, so the way it appears in the tube is the same as when it's applied. For reference, I'm a very chocolate girl and it's the perfect shade of pink for me. If you're dark skinned and you want to look like a chocolate Barbie Doll, this is your shade. I will definitely be repurchasing!",

Tell me how this gloss managed to stay the entire day while maintaining its color and shine. It also left my lips feeling super soft. The color match per undertone is quite accurate and works well with most skin tones. I have to mention that it does have a light fragrance to it, so if you dont like fragrances then you may have to try a different brand. I absolutely love this product and I hope they do not discontinue this in the future as I will contuine buying this for as long as I live",

It's really disappointing because I absolutely love the color and haven't seen many lip glosses with the same selection as ABH.
