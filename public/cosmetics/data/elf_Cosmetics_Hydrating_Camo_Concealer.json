        "comments": "As someone with combination skin, I love this concealer and have for a long time. It doesn't cake or stick to dry spots (under eyes, around healing blemishes, etc.) and it doesn't fade away in oily spots. I get little to no creasing in my under eyes and this concealer is hydrating enough to perform well there. I had a little trouble finding my shade at first, but I feel that there are a good amount of options for varying undertones and shades. I think it is important to note that prepping your skin plays a large role in the performance of your concealer. I like to use this with a very hydrating base underneath (Nivea creme is my personal preference. I also use ELF's Power Grip setting spray and the two products are a great combination), and when used correctly, I feel that this concealer covers blemishes well and looks like skin in most conditions.",

I fell in love with the 16hr Camo concealer however it was too drying for my under eye area and accentuated my fine lines.  I will soon be 58 yrs old and my skin has always been oily however my under eye area is now dry.  This stuff is PERFECT to blur the aging process!! \r\n After moisturizer, I apply the Poreless Putty Primer with my fingertips under the eye then follow with the hydrating concealer (little goes a long way) also with my fingertips to warm it up.  I then use a damp beauty blender to blend it out and set it with my Laura Mercier Translucent Powder and the end results are FLAWLESS!!  I live in a very hot/humid climate and this concealer is Perfect for my no-makeup days using the hydrating camo under eye and the 16hr camo to blur face imperfections once you blend it out and set it!  However, do BEWARE that the color chart is OFF and you can't use the 16hr Camo Concealer of the same shade as your guide.  In my pic, 1st Row 16hr Camo: (L-R) Deep Olive, Deep Cinnamon, Deep Chestnut, Rich Chocolate.  2nd Row Hydrating Camo: (L-R) Deep Caramel, Deep Chestnut, Rich Chocolate.......as you can see the color difference for Deep Chestnut & Rich Chocolate!!",

Fair beige is too dark for me so for the winter I grabbed a hydrating concealer in fair warm since that's what I had in the matte finish. When I brought it home, it was not the same color at all and was also too dark. I finally went and bought the fair rose since that was the lightest, and it is pretty good. Look at the picture of the hydrating vs matte swatches both in fair warm. They should be close to identical and definitely are not. Confusing, huh?",
