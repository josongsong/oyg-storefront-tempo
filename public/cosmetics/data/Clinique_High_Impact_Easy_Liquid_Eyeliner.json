        "comments": "I have a lot of wrinkles around the corners of my eyes due to strabismus and squinting as a teen before I got surgery, and this does not get lost in the creases or clump up. It goes on, stays, and I don't even feel it. Great for a natural look without any other makeup, or put it on with a full face for your special occasion. My everyday look is liner, mascara, and brow tint. I use the black liner and mascara, and my eyes just look a little brighter. When I am ready for a night out, I put this on a bit thicker over eyeshadow and add a little wing for the cat-eye.\n\nThis is my favorite eyeliner, and I've used a few liquid eyeliners. I first bought it a year ago when purchasing other Clinique items online to get the free shipping, and I haven't turned back. I use the black because my eyelashes are lighter toward the root, and this helps hide that (along with mascara).",

        "comments": "This has been my favorite eyeliner for years. I love how it glides, I have great control over how my lines look and they are extra sharp. It's a very beginner friendly eyeliner as well. Solid black, great payoff. HOWEVER, I'm not sure if I'm simply unlucky or something changed in their formula but I ordered 2 eyeliners since it was cheaper to buy directly from Clinique than a department store (at the time of writing this). The eyeliners I received are thin and watery. I called Clinique and was transferred multiple times. One of those times, the rep said formulas change from time to time but can only tell me if that's what happened if I still kept my box from the last eyeliner I bought over a year ago?? She wanted me to read the ingredients and that's how she would know if the formula changed. It seemed like this lady just couldn't be bothered. Anyway, if this is how the product is now, I don't recommend it.",
