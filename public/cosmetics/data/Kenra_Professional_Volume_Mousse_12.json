I bought this b/c my thick, coarse, dry hair loves the Kenra Blow Dry Spray, the Silkening Mist, and the Smoothing Spray. I was shocked the first time I used this … I could hardly believe the soft, bouncy, CRAZY VOLUME this gave my hair!! It was literally almost too much (except I don't \"believe\" you can have too much volume)!!! \nSooooo today I went to have my roots done and a trim. My hairstylist could hardly believe it when I walked in! She doesnt \"like\" Kenra products, but I brought my own Blow Dry Spray AND this volume mousse for her to use on my hair. She was so impressed w/them in my hair!! Silky, bouncy, voluminous hair!!!",

I loved the Kenra Volume Mousse when I was doing the blow-dry and hot-rollers routine (curling irons take too long when you have this much hair), but set it aside when I started rocking my natural curls again. I had gone back to using Tresseme's curly mousse, but they ruined their product last year by changing the light scent that dissipated when dry to a heavy, overpowering, headache-inducing perfume that takes lots of hot water and multiple shampoos to get out. So it was back to the drawing board for me. I've tried several curly-hair products, and found a couple okay ones, but nothing to write home about. I also found more migraine-inducing ones, because for some reason, manufacturers think we want strangers to be able to smell our hair products from miles away (note to manufacturers: We don't. Heavy fragrances are rude and unprofessional and make us -and others- sick.) While cleaning my bathroom shelf, I saw my can of Kenra Mousse and thought, why not? So I tried it on my natural curls for the first time and wowza! My curls are light and fluffy, sexy and defined. There's no crunchy gel feeling, no heavy greasy/oily feeling, the light scent dissipates when dry, and no alcohol to dry my hair out. Next day hair is easy- I mist with water, scruching in additional mousse if needed. I never thought about using this on my natural curls, but I'm so glad I did! My hair looks and feels amazing. Thank you, Kenra!",

It was perfect for my fine, thin, hair and gave it non-sticky volume and light/med hold. It came time to order more and I couldn't find it in stock anywhere which leads me to believe it's been discontinued. :( So I began the processing of looking for something comparable and decided to try Kendra Volume Mousse 12. Based on reviews and the product description it sounds like what I was getting with Alterna. WRONG. It is soooo heavy, I only use a small amount because of my hair texture and it feels and looks greasy, no volume at all, and oily the following morning. I am so disappointed, I spent too much for a mousse that doesn't deliver on it's claims.",
