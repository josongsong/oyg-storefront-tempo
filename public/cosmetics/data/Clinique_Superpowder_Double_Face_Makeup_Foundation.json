My only complaint with it is that it doesn't really play nice with oily skin (which I have, unfortunately).",

At first the coverage went on great it covered the redness in my skin. Sadly after only a short amount of time less than a few hours it literally look like it was sliding off my face and was very patchy. You could literally see lines between my skin and the powder. I did my normal makeup routine that I always do before I put a powder foundation I prepped my skin I used a primer same one that I've always used. But I need makeup that will last more than a couple hours. Very very sad that I will have to return this product.",

It's quick and convenient like a powder, but it somehow leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized instead of flaky like most powder. On light days I apply all about eyes concealer (yes, I use it for concealer anywhere, it's so smooth), and then I brush this powder lightly over my face. The coverage is buildable so you can just apply another layer if you want more. It will rub off on clothing or hands so let it set before pulling on a turtleneck.",

Also, the main ingredient is talc which we know can cause ovarian cancer so I would stay away from it. BareMinerals blemish remedy is amazing and all of the ingredients are wonderful.",
