I came across this online and decide to give it a try. The first night I used the moisturizer my face felt the most hydrated it has in quite some time. The smell isn't bad in my opinion, but I really like the water based texture from this moisturizer. A little goes a long ways as well! My skin is normally combination of oily and dry but some days it has a mind of its own whether one day it wants to be dry and then another day it wants to be oily. I wish it would last all day as I have applied it in the morning before I went to work, but then I also sweat at work all the time. I will definitely be buying this again.",

This is good!\" I was relieved since I had already grown to like it and did not want to switch. The price is good and I am a rewards member so if you are reading this and you think the price seems high, maybe use some of your Ulta Rewards points to help offset the cost. I'm to the point where I have tried so many things for my menopause-era skin and I buy what works w/o worrying too much about the cost.",

I have a jar of of Neutregena HydraBoost gel, so I set them side by side with eachother. It's nearly identical. Even the fresh clean fragrance is very similar. Both of these moisturizers perform EXACTLY the same. The only slight difference that I noticed between the two, was Belif Tru Cream Aqua Bomb did make me break out a tad. Nothing major, but I did get a couple tiny whiteheads around my T- Zone. Neutregena has never given me that problem, and has been my go to moisturizer, because it doesn't break me out. I would still use the Belif, it preformed exactly the same as the HydraBoost, and the little breakout was nothing to be alarmed about, and it definitely wouldn't detour me from using the product. I love both! I will use both. This is good to know, in case the retailer doesn't have one or the other, now I have a substitute for each one. Could possibly be a dupe also. I received the Belif True Cream Aqua Bomb from BzzAgent for free, in exchange for my honest opinion, so I don't know the price up front.",

After the first day, I did notice some skin irritation, minor breakout, but it did not continue and resolved, I think my skin was getting used to the product. Loved the feel, definitely made my skin feel sheer and moisturized. I also really liked the packaging surprisingly, the lid of the container had a lip that made it easier to open, small detail but definitely noticed! \n\nUnfortunately, the product has an off-putting scent, very reminiscent of a lemon scented cleaner ( think pine sol ). It was also awful if I happened to get it on my lips, very very chemical-y taste. I started sucking my lip in when I applied and avoided that issue. But I just couldn't get past the smell. Overall, the product does what it is supposed to, definitely moisturizes, doesn't linger, soaks in well and no greasiness or residue. If the scent does not bother you then this could be a great product to try.",
