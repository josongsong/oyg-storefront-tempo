Caffeine products usually do this to him but I noticed his wrinkles aren't as intense and definitely smoother. He also looks fresh in the morning after getting ready. He says that the caffeine makes him look and feel awake. I agree.",

For those who have never tried it, today is the day!\r\nThis is balm-like eye cream that needs only a little bit per application to work effectively. I've found this product to be superbly effective against dark circles and fine lines. Especially impressive on top of Line-Reducing Eye-Brightening Concentrate. \r\nThis is an eye repair not to overlook. Great for both Men and Women who want the best eye cream in their life.",

For one, the cream is very heavy and its hard to work with, clumpy and does not smooth out using your ring finger.",
