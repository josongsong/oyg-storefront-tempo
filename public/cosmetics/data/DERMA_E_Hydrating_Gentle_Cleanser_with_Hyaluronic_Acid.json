My skin does seems less dry compared to other cleansers, however, there's one problem: every time I use this I break out. Every time. Which sucks because I used this initially to try to help my (minimal) acne. I get the strangest pimples from it too, they seemingly sprout up overnight and are yet ready to burst. They're different from my normal pimples. I usually don't even get many, but I've used this cleanser maybe twice recently and I've already got 5 new ones :( Maybe look elsewhere if you are acne prone...",

I figured out with warm water the sticky residue left after is impossible to get off, but if you use cold water and a cotton pad it helps so much, but only didn't feel the residue one time in my times of using this cleanser. It doesn't strip your skin, but it does break you out if you don't get most or al the residue off. I even use an acid exfoliate and it still had a residue on it. It is weird. I don't understand why it does this: the sticky residue.  I guess I'm gna have to pay more attention and time washing it off with cold water and with a cotton pad. Wash cloth does absolutely nothing to was off. Also, it bubbles like a soap when you wash it off.",

I am an avid user of AHA & BHA'S, use prescription Retinoic acid every night, and brands send me multiple products to test for review. Overzealous multiple product use can occasionally disturb my skin's acid mantle; leaving my normal to oily skin dehydrated and stressed. I have enjoyed using other Derma E products, so I decided to try this. I was VERY impressed with how well it cleaned, yet left my skin feeling incredibly soft and hydrated. Within a few days my skin was back to normal. I will continue to keep this in my rotation..",

I figured out with warm water the sticky residue left after is impossible to get off, but if you use cold water and a cotton pad it helps so much, but only didn't feel the residue one time in my times of using this cleanser. It doesn't strip your skin, but it does break you out if you don't get most or al the residue off. I even use an acid exfoliate and it still had a residue on it. It is weird. I don't understand why it does this: the sticky residue.  I guess I'm gna have to pay more attention and time washing it off with cold water and with a cotton pad. Wash cloth does absolutely nothing to was off. Also, it bubbles like a soap when you wash it off.",
