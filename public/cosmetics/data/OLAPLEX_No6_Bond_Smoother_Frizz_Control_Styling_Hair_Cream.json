I have straight hair, and it still makes a noticeable difference—leaving it softer, shinier, and more manageable without feeling greasy or weighed down. The texture is silky and absorbs well, and it works beautifully whether air-dried or blow-dried. Even in humid weather, my hair stays sleek and polished. A small amount goes a long way, and it's especially great for damaged, dry, or color-treated hair. It protects from heat and helps cut down styling time. This product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review.",

        "comments": "As the result of years and years of abusing my fine, thin hair, I started to lose a lot of my hair. I am post-menopausal and that has only added to the horrible condition of my hair. I did a lot of research online: reading reviews, looking at chemicals in many products and watching YouTube videos. So much of my research lead me to the Olaplex Line of Products...again, and again and again. I have 2B hair and only B not A because of the crazy way my grays are growing in. The first month I started with No. 0 & No. 3 in a kit. I was impressed by the way that my hair suddenly became so soft and smooth. The next month, I splurged on the No. 4 & No. 5 (the shampoo and conditioner). Nothing remarkable here. I just felt that I should be using the whole line to be consistent. I want to give it time to see how my hair reacts to it. Then the 'Game Changer'; I bought No. 6 & No. 7!!! No. 6 is a Bond Smoother and No. 7 is a light oil. I had big problems with flyaway hair last winter and nothing I bought really helped. This first time I used No. 6 & No. 7 I put about a dime size amount in my palm and mixed in about 5 drops of the oil. My hair was instantly shiny and smooth. It was just amazing!!!! I am now retired, so I have time to take care of my hair. I use little hairspray and am opting for a more blunt and smooth look. (This from a former 80's, Big Hair, massive hairspray Queen.) It's taking time to get used to, but day by day, I'm coming around. The biggest thing I have noticed is that I would get a big ball of hair in my wide-tooth comb every time I washed my hair. I only was 2 times a week. Now, I get 10-15 hairs!!! This amazes me. I could go on and on about this line, but I'm probably already over my allotted words. To sum up my review, if you can afford only one of the Olaplex products (as each item costs about $25-30), choose No. 6-the Bond Smoother Cream. You will notice instant results the first time you use it. Olaplex has saved my hair!!! P.S. Could Olaplex develop a hairspray that has more natural/healthy ingredients? I just need a little spritz of something. (Old habits never truly die!)",

        "comments": "I heard SO much hype about this company and was excited to try it out as my hair was damaged by chemical processing at a salon. However, I'm Very disappointed overall‚ I bought the full recommended products for my hair and some extras as my hair is really long‚ based on their quiz‚however my hair is so now MORE dry and frizzy from it‚ Worse than it was before! The only product I felt was nice to use was the shampoo because it felt very moisturizing and didn't feel like it stripped my hair‚until I added the conditioner‚then after rinsing it my hair felt so dry and crunchy! I also am not impressed with the smell of the products. I like my hair to smell really good and last‚ but this doesn't do it for me. Each product smells different and you can barely smell them.. and I don't like mint smell in my hair products unless it's a clarifying product. The other thing about this company I was not impressed with was their lack of customer service! If you buy from the company directly and need to return your products for a full refund, you have to mail it all the way to California and you have to pay for shipping and also don't get your initial shipping cost returned! And then you have to WAIT till they get it in the mail before they refund you anything‚ There needs to be a better system where you can initiate a return and get a shipping label. To return it, like all other companies do now in this age‚very backwards. Won't purchase this again and especially not from them!",
