        "comments": "I purchased the vanilla/acai scent, and, honestly, I wish I could get a perfume/scented balm form of this. It is flavorless on the lips, but has a subtle scent that is the perfect cross between a little fruity and your basic crowd-pleasing vanilla. If you are sensitive to scents, it is not strong enough to be overbearing. The product itself is wonderful. It's a bigger tub than I thought it would be (but still small enough to pretty easily fit in a pocket), and a little product goes a LONG way, so you're really getting your money's worth for this stuff. The formula itself really melts the instant it hits skin, so pick up less product than you think you'll need. It's hydrating, buttery smooth, and lasts longer than your average chapstick or lip balm.\n\nThis is definitely a little pricier for a drugstore product, but it's still not nearly as expensive as high-end products, and as I said, I'm confident it will last me quite a while. In my opinion, it's worth the price.\n\nI recently picked up a birthday gift from another beauty store (Ulta literally won't let me type the brand name, but it starts with S- and ends in -ephora), which included a mini Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask. It's hyped up a lot, and it IS a nice product. First thing I noticed when I switched to the Laneige mask from the Mario Badescu one? I wanted to switch back. I'm really not terribly picky or hyper-aware of significant differences in product performance between things like skincare products since they can take a long time of consistent use to show ANY results. In this case, I noticed in under a DAY that I prefered the Mario Badescu mask.\n\nIf you're looking for a much cheaper alternative to the (full-size) Laneige mask that will probably last you longer? Look no further.",

It's a bigger tub than I thought it would be (but still small enough to pretty easily fit in a pocket), and a little product goes a LONG way, so you're really getting your money's worth for this stuff. The formula itself really melts the instant it hits skin, so pick up less product than you think you'll need. It's hydrating, buttery smooth, and lasts longer than your average chapstick or lip balm.\n\nThis is definitely a little pricier for a drugstore product, but it's still not nearly as expensive as high-end products, and as I said, I'm confident it will last me quite a while. In my opinion, it's worth the price.\n\nI recently picked up a birthday gift from another beauty store (Ulta literally won't let me type the brand name, but it starts with S- and ends in -ephora), which included a mini Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask. It's hyped up a lot, and it IS a nice product. First thing I noticed when I switched to the Laneige mask from the Mario Badescu one? I wanted to switch back. I'm really not terribly picky or hyper-aware of significant differences in product performance between things like skincare products since they can take a long time of consistent use to show ANY results. In this case, I noticed in under a DAY that I prefered the Mario Badescu mask.\n\nIf you're looking for a much cheaper alternative to the (full-size) Laneige mask that will probably last you longer? Look no further.",

        "comments": "Sounds counterintuitive. When the mask was applied at night, it is very thick and sticky. It was also very hard to remove due to how sticky it was if you wanted to wash off the remainder in the morning. However after a month or so of using it religiously at night, my lips became dry that they burned in the mornings. A couple nights without using it and just using my normal chapstick, no more dry, burning lips in the morning. I like a lot of other Mario products, however this is a pass.",
