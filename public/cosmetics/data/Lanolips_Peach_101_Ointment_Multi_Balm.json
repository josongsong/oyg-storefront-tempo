I personally like the scent and flavor of it, but i figured id give lanolips a try since its much more portable than my giant tube of A&D lol. \nMy main con is I hate the peach scent, its like bubble gum. I would try another scent tho! I feel like glazed donut would be a perfect cover up if you didnt like the smell/taste of plain lanolin.\nOther than that, its been a great product! Works just as well as the drugstore stuff, and the packaging is cute. \nLanolin will always be thick and sort of greasy, yes your hair will stick to your lips on a windy day! But its super healing",

        "comments": "I dont usually write reviews but this balm is so amazing. First of all the tube is so much better than a stick because I can leave it in a hot car or carry it in my pocket and it won't melt. It also smells nice. I got an unscented tinted version too and that one smelled a little too much like lanolin for me to want it in my lips but the fruit flavor of this is subtle but  not too subtle. The BEST THING about this, though, is how nourishing it is. It lasts for hours before I feel like I need to reapply. I've even started wearing it at night in place of my Laneige lip mask and it works equally well. \nI also like that I can use it on my cuticles.",

I began using it on my lips and it's the only thing that can moisturize and plump them up. The trick for my chronically dry lips is that it has to be lanolin, and lanolin alone. Flavor is fine but no shea butter, coconut oil, etc - my lips will get irritated. I can use this under my lip products - a very tiny amount goes a long way - and it'll keep them hydrated. Lano made it easier to apply as they placed it into a conveniently sized tube that has a lip applicator tip (yay!). I have also used this between my fingers because the cold weather started drying out my skin and it worked really well. Lastly, the tube is not supposed to be full. You're buying a certain amount of product, and this goes for anything. Packaging size does not always amount to product amount.",

This isn't a bad review by any means because the formula is great but I got the peach flavor and it smells/tastes nothing at all like peach. My lips feel super nourished and I'll buy another flavor but the packaging isn't there nor the flavor. The peach is almost more like bubble gum to me.",
