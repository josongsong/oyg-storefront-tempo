The amt says its the same but jar held up to my old Blue Jar is definitely smaller. It just felt better in my hand (The old Blue Jar). Other Clarins (New rehabbed Clarins) items have indeed shrunk. The Old Favorite of mine (one step orange scrub) was shrunk from 4.2 oz to 3.9 oz. And more money. And changed. This  product (night cream) is just not the same. I love Clarins but I miss the old formula. Why change a Great thing that actually works? For decades my mother and I could reliably go back year after year to repurchase favorite beauty products or clothes we loved and now they are gone in a flash! I don't like this at all. It's sad. Really is. My Mom would hate this.",

        "comments": "I received Clarins new multiactive nightbcream complimentary from Clarins and skeepers in exchange for my honest review. So my honest opinion is that this cream is just love. From packaging to final effects its  all great. I love he pink jar that looks so luxorious. Than talking about ingredients it has some interesting natural ingredients of which the ones I liked most are Niacinamide, sea holly and strawberry tree. All these natural ingredients are intended to target fine lines and wrinkles that appear on face as a sign of aging and also due to stress. My skin was getting dehydrated, loosing moisture barrier and having all the signs of stress and fatigue because of my sleepless nights with my little one. So this cream was just God sent for me and it is reverting my skin to look more hydrated glowy and fresh. It has a nice creamy texture, it's easy to use and to apply to skin. Gets instantly absorbed and does not leave any stickiness. Skin feels so soft and smooth and hydrated after use. It would definitely recommend this.",

I don't understand Clarins' need to change such a wonderful product to this! I wish they would have asked their clients' opinions. The formula is irritating, not as rich, and burns! After applying it, my face was immediately red and burning.  I had to wash my face. I changed to Nuxe and had to leave Clarins after so many years. It's very unfortunate.",
