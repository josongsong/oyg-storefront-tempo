Definitely recommend buying and shipping was very fast too!",

My Chi is small for when my hair was shorter. I will continue to take a while with the Chi. I would go over the same chunk of hair 3 times, and it still wasn't straightening. It's so lightweight and cheaply made plastic.  Also, it was supposed to come with a free gift (blow dryer), I didn't get that. I know it says \"while supplies last\", but they need to take the free gift option down if they are out. It still says that a week later.",

I straighten my neieces hair once a week and she has super curly hair and it works great! I am about to purchase my 3rd one! The first one I bought I dropped and broke it. The one I have now I've had for over 10 years. It still works great but sometimes I have problems turning it on and the heat doesn't work as well but no complaints because it's 10 years old. This is honestly the best flat iron. In my opinion it's way better than the titanium one because the titanium one doesn't have a tight grip on your hair like the ceramic one does. I know because my mom has the titanium one and I've used it and it does not work as well as this flat iron. Same brand and the titanium one is way more expensive but doesn't work as well",

The reviews were great but also the price. I was so excited to use them when I got home. My hair was so silky straight by the time I got done, it was amazing. It thunderstrormed and was about 95 degrees that day here in Baltimore, and I was outside for most of the day and not once did my hair frizz up. I was beyond impressed and very happy with my purchase. It's worth every cent.",

Thought at first I was hitting the button so I changed how I held it to prevent that and it was still turning off. Sometimes you get a dud, so I exchanged for the same thing and now I'm running into the same problem as the first one. It's very annoying to have to turn it back on 15 times just to straighten my hair.",
