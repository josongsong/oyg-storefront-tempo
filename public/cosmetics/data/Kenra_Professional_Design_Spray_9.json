It makes my curls hold and stay AND is brushable. It also seems to add good volume. I still finish w/a hold / finishing hair spray after I've brushed / or picked out. \nI also like to give a light spray and comb thru on DRY HAIR and then hit it just w/blow dryer. \nFor reference my hair is thick, coarse, wavy, and naturally dry. And I am a Kenra fan girl … I do luv nearly every Kenra product I've bought.",

At times, I like it even better. When I blow dry with a round brush, I'll lightly spray the section, and it will hold the curl in place, adding a bit of volume as well, and without the stickiness that Kenra's #25 volume spray tends to have. The only conplaint is the smell. I'm sensitive to smells, and although this does not trigger a migraine, I am not fond of the smell. I have that issue with most of Kenra's products.",

When I straighten it, I want a hairspray that will keep it straight, help it not to frizz and yet not leave a white film on my hair.  Even though this hairspray smells good, it doesn't help me at all. I straighten my hair, spray it with this product, and within the hour, I have nasty curls again from the heat and humidity. It's like I just put perfume on my hair.  So frustrated.",
