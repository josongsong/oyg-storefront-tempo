        "comments": "I bought this when it was on sale (thankfully) after reading all of the amazing reviews. I'm glad that it works well on so many others, but unfortunately, my experience with this primer has been nothing short of frustrating. For reference, I'm 4W1 in Estee Lauder's Double Wear foundation. I've worn this alone as a sunscreen, which results in it forming white streaks on my neck and around my nose and lips, which looks quite disgusting. When worn under makeup, it starts to pill, resulting in me wasting the last half hour of my life prepping my skin for foundation since I have to take it off and start all over again. I'd suggest that people try it on in the store and see how it wears or wait for it to be on sale like I did (even then, it's not worth it, in my opinion).",

For the price, you don't get enough product, and the formula is just not it—especially for brown skin. It left a noticeable white cast and made me look gray and oily throughout the day. Even when I skip makeup, it still PILLS!!!, which is incredibly frustrating. I really wanted to like this, but it's just not working for me. Is it just me, or is this a common issue?

        "comments": "This has way too much fragrance and smells like old lady perfume. Shame on me for not reading the ingredients, but not many of the recent reviews mention a strong perfume scent. But if you look at them, it has added fragrance.\n\nThe sunscreen itself is ok, but I wouldn't call it lightweight. It's definitely a thicker moisturizer/sunscreen and probably best suited for dry skin. My combo skin wasn't overly greasy, but for me it is just too heavy for daytime use. Also, It didn't do anything to help my makeup look better or last, so not that great as a primer.\n\nI got it during the 21 days of beauty, and even at half price, it's way too much for this product. Other than vitamin E, there are no real skincare benefits in it. There are so many better sunscreens. I hate waste so I'll probably continue to use it as a body sunscreen. But with all the fragrance it's not going anywhere near my face.",
