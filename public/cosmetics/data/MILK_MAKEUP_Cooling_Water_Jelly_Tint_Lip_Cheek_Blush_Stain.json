The feel is awesome, but it's a little hard to get full coverage without putting it on a few/bunch of times.  But I will say there's nothing like it and it's a great idea. Just needs a little more tinkering.",

        "comments": "The texture of these truly is a fun experience, but my concern going into this was: is it practical?As a person with dry skin, I had quite a learning curve with this product. At first, I tried using it as a blush over my foundation/powder. That did not work out well at all, as I noticed it was nearly impossible to blend the product (regardless of how I applied: I tried fingers, using a brush to pick up the product, and the worst of all - directly swiping on skin!) I ended up removing this in all scenarios as it created a harsh line of demarcation on my face. Not a cute look!I then tried it as a lip stain, and while that worked fairly well, it seemed to only stain the center of my lips. So far, this was seeming like a dud of a product!However, I am a determined soul. So I finally decided to use my heftiest moisturizer, a lip balm on my lips, and THEN try this product. And what do you know - that created a lovely look. I could blend any way I wanted, and the lip stain was lovely. AND GET THIS: even over all this moisture, this product LASTS. The entire day. It's hard to fathom the staying power of this product!So, what did we learn here? Well, if you have dry (or dehydrated!) skin, especially if you also wear foundation, this may be a bit of a struggle. However, you can still work with these if you moisturize HEAVILY. Oily skin types, you may be all ears as this might be the PERFECT product for you. I hear you all struggle with longevity, and this product really shines in that attribute.Product gifted by Milk in exchange for my honest thoughts!",

        "comments": "I bought this product because I wanted to try a new blush & I like the cooling water serum so I decided to give the new ph jelly blush a try. You can't see it when its first applied so that makes it super hard to know if you've applied enough & if you have blended it enough. On me it always comes up WAY too pigmented and like a hot pink color, it looks almost childish on me, even with the smallest dot that I try to apply with the product & it also does not blend well, I blend right after applying and its always blotchy with bald patches because well when your blending it, you can't see what your blending. I give 2 stars instead of 1 because the product feels so good on the skin so cold & like fresh? But I wouldn't purchase this again, especially not the ph version.",
