I love how this moisturizer sinks into my skin and the way my skin feels in the morning. I will mention that I was also applying a hyaluronic acid serum before this murad moisturizer and it seemed to cause a drying reaction on my face as this murad moisturizer has hyaluronic acid in it already so I discontinued the hyaluronic acid serum. The dryness resolved. This was also amazing to put on when I accidentally got sunburnt on my fwce and I feel like it helped rehydrate my skin back to life and heal the sunburn. I plan to rebuy this when i run out 💜",

But this, this was way better than I could have imagined.  I used it as the last step in my skincare routine at night and woke up looking well rested and refreshed.  My skin felt bouncy, velvety and hydrated.  No signs of oiliness.  Will definitely be purchasing a jar to see how it does with continuous longer term use.",
