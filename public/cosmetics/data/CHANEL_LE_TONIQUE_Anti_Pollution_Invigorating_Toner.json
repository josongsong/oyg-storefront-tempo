        "comments": "This toner feels soothing but doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky at all. The scent is amazing and very light, but of course like all chanel products, if you are very sensitive to fragrance I would recommend a sample before buying. Alcohol free so its great for my dry leaning skin, still an excellent makeup remover. Preps my skin nicely for the rest of my routine. This is a staple for me!!",

Any leftover grime or makeup on my face is gently removed when I use this toner with a white cotton pad. Others leave behind grime but this one captures at all!",
