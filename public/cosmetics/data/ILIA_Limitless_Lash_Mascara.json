However, if you don't mind taking a couple minutes to use this brush to its potential, this mascara is unmatched.  This gives me the longest, cleanest lashes of any mascara I've ever used. My lashes are lovely and fluttery and there's no irritation.  This does not stain the skin around my eyes, and it removes easily with my oil cleanser.  I love this long-lasting, gorgeous mascara.",

        "comments": "TLDR: Mascara formula is great but the application wand sucks!\n\nI am a mascara junkie. I've tried them all. And even waterproof mascara leaves me with racoon eyes for whatever reason, even if i dont apply the mascara to my bottom lashes! Like seriously, how does it get down there?! So when I was shopping for a foundation at a well known black and white striped store: the sales associate just happened to turn me on to Ilias Super Serum Skin Tint foundation. I was so excited to find a clean foundation that matched! Ok so whats this got to do with the mascara…. Well she then asked me about mascara and I told her I had just bought an expensive one last time I was in and told her all my woes with different mascaras. She then procedded to tell me about this mascara and promised I wouldnt have the same issue despite it not being a waterproof formula. So I tried it there in the store with a clean sample wand and it looked fantastic! I was so surprised! It gave great definition and length which is hard for my sparse eyelashes. I really liked it so then she told me about the wand in the tube and how the wand has one side for application and the other side of the wand is more of like a separator for your lashes. Of course my response to her was if it has a separator built into the wand, are you telling me that this mascara clumps, and she said no. So I'm kind of confused why Ilia even integrates this into its mascara wand. I do think that the brush for the mascara sucks because of this. The lash seperator side of the wand is very hard and it's hard to always tell the difference between it and the application side, but you will definitely feel it on your eyelash line as you apply it and for me it hurts a lot if I happen to use the wrong side. I almost always accidentally end up using both sides when I am applying the mascara because I twirl my mascara wand as I put my mascara on to make sure all my lashes are really coated well and if you hit the separator when i am at the base of my lashes it actually hurts my sensitive lash line. Now I read some reviews that said this mascara is so clean that it is barely visible and I think they are getting those results because they are not using the correct side of the mascara wand and they may not apply mascara in a twisting motion and more than one coat. I always apply two coats of mascara so my lashes are nice and full. So if you happen to apply the mascara with the side that's supposed to be what separates your lashes then you're not gonna get good application. If the sales associate had not told me and showed me the wand, I would have never known or noticed. This is the perfect everyday mascara if Ilia would just make the wand a standard wand instead of a dual one.",

        "comments": "This is a non-incentivized review. I spent my own $ bc I saw the brush and was curious. I'm a die hard mascara fan. I HATE the hassle of fake lashes. Money is legit not a factor for foundation and mascara for me and I would spend $100+ om a mascara if it did what I wanted it to. This does. I put one coat of Lancome Mascara primer on and let it dry. Then I curl my lashes with my Sheseido curler. Then I put 2 coats of this mascara on and I look like an absolute smoking hot bombshell. I'm 46, I've had 3 kids. I am confident in my body and appearance. This mascara gives me exactly what I want. Volume, definition, separation, length, thickness, blackness, and durability. I wear bone/cream shadow on my lids and this mascara does not turn gray as some do when coming in contact with light colored eyeshadows/concealers. \n\nBecause I do mot like the hourglass shaped mascara wand bristles that the Volumizing formula has, they skip over my middle lashes and smudges in my inner corners so I wont even try it. But honestly there is no need bc this bush's two sides build and separate perfectly. \n\nLimitless Lash captures people's attention. It washes off easily. I wear waterproof eyeliner and the above-mentioned primer/mascara combination and my eyes are defined. While it is NOT waterproof, I do absolutely adore this mascara. \n\nThe only drawback is what other reviews have mentioned: it smells soooo gross. It's almost like a hay/cow pasture, not even joking. I can smell my eyelashes sometimes and it makes me self conscious when I'm in an elevator or when I give someone a kiss. I love it so much that I don't even care anymore. If this is ever made in a waterproof unscented formula, people will probably never buy any other brand of mascara again. \n\nI am not gatekeeping this, I never want Ilia to stop making it.",

If you'd rather pay over twenty bucks to look like you skipped mascara, this is a great option, but personally I want a product that gives length, volume and color. This absolutely does not.",

        "comments": "TLDR: Mascara formula is great but the application wand sucks!\n\nI am a mascara junkie. I've tried them all. And even waterproof mascara leaves me with racoon eyes for whatever reason, even if i dont apply the mascara to my bottom lashes! Like seriously, how does it get down there?! So when I was shopping for a foundation at a well known black and white striped store: the sales associate just happened to turn me on to Ilias Super Serum Skin Tint foundation. I was so excited to find a clean foundation that matched! Ok so whats this got to do with the mascara…. Well she then asked me about mascara and I told her I had just bought an expensive one last time I was in and told her all my woes with different mascaras. She then procedded to tell me about this mascara and promised I wouldnt have the same issue despite it not being a waterproof formula. So I tried it there in the store with a clean sample wand and it looked fantastic! I was so surprised! It gave great definition and length which is hard for my sparse eyelashes. I really liked it so then she told me about the wand in the tube and how the wand has one side for application and the other side of the wand is more of like a separator for your lashes. Of course my response to her was if it has a separator built into the wand, are you telling me that this mascara clumps, and she said no. So I'm kind of confused why Ilia even integrates this into its mascara wand. I do think that the brush for the mascara sucks because of this. The lash seperator side of the wand is very hard and it's hard to always tell the difference between it and the application side, but you will definitely feel it on your eyelash line as you apply it and for me it hurts a lot if I happen to use the wrong side. I almost always accidentally end up using both sides when I am applying the mascara because I twirl my mascara wand as I put my mascara on to make sure all my lashes are really coated well and if you hit the separator when i am at the base of my lashes it actually hurts my sensitive lash line. Now I read some reviews that said this mascara is so clean that it is barely visible and I think they are getting those results because they are not using the correct side of the mascara wand and they may not apply mascara in a twisting motion and more than one coat. I always apply two coats of mascara so my lashes are nice and full. So if you happen to apply the mascara with the side that's supposed to be what separates your lashes then you're not gonna get good application. If the sales associate had not told me and showed me the wand, I would have never known or noticed. This is the perfect everyday mascara if Ilia would just make the wand a standard wand instead of a dual one.",

        "comments": "I was so excited to receive this product from pinch me in exchange for my honest review. So here are My thoughts on this ilia limitless lash mascara. Let's start off with the packaging. It is very nice sleek simple tube with a silky matte feel. It feels of very good quality. The mascara wand doesn't do it for me. Im not that much a fan of plastic wands they just don't do much for my lashes which are stick straight and fine but hard to work with because there is an abundance of them. And the fact that there is different sizes on the wand to define, lift and separate was a no go for me. I like brush bristle mascara where all the bristles are basically the same size . The smell is funky I mean I know all mascaras have a chemically smell but this one also has a hint of floral to it...idk if that's what it is and maybe because it's something in there because its more natural idk but I smell floral and then chemical which doesn't smell nice. And even after a while if I turn my head a certain way you can get a faint whiff of the smell.  The formula to me is way too wet. I prefer dry as a bone like too faced better than sex waterproof mascara and this compared to that is like trying to curl my lashes with water.  It doesn't apply evenly ..it is very clumpy and it weighs down my lashes so much that they are just heavily coated straight sticks it looks awful. I tried 2 layers and that was a mistake I had to wash it off and try again the next day. And yes all the times I used this Mascara and I really gave it a lot of oppurtunies to wow me...I used a lash curler before hand. I will say that despite how heavily coated and droopy my lashes were they didn't feel heavy at all it felt pretty weightless almost like nothing was on them which some people really like. I like to be able to feel my mascara though like when it dries down it becomes hard not soft like this one. It's clearly not a waterproof mascara so if you touch your eyes or rub on the lashes at all it will all come off everywhere.  Now I did leave this Mascara on for a good 6 hours because that's all I could handle and it was a mess. It was on the bottom of my eyes because of sweat and oil and it was flaking off. Maybe this product could work for someone who already has pretty curly long thick lashes and they just want to use this for a little extra lengthen on a natural makeup day but for someone who needs alot of help with curling and lengthening and volume this did not help me out at all.  My lashes just did not agree with this formula  and that is perfectly okay because what works for one person may not work for the next.",
