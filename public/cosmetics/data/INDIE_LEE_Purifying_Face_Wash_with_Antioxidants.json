After I ran out and repurchased a different cleanser my acne came back very soon after switching. But as soon as I go back to this specific cleanser it goes away almost immediately, my skin just loves it!",

Love this stuff I hope they never change the formula. It's perfect, the scent is subtle but clean, the packaging is so cute, the price is moderately expensive, but WORTH EVERY PENNY. Do your self a favor and give this face wash a try.",

        "comments": "I am a w***e for the special cleansing gel from Dermalogica but think this is even better because it also takes off makeup! It's gentle enough to not strip my skin but does make a noticeable difference with my acne. As advertised, my skin feels refreshed but not super tight after cleansing. It doesn't get off the heavier makeup unless I use a couple pumps or combine it with something else, like my Well People plantfoliant. I have oily/combination skin that does not do well with a lot acne cleansers. My mom threw as many Neutrogena products as she could at me growing up and they never seemed to work. The first time I found something that I actually liked as a daily cleanser for acne was the Avene cleanace gel cleanser. So thank you Indie Lee for coming through with a great product for sensitive skinned acne-prone oily folks like me :)",

It's gentle enough to not strip my skin but does make a noticeable difference with my acne. As advertised, my skin feels refreshed but not super tight after cleansing. It doesn't get off the heavier makeup unless I use a couple pumps or combine it with something else, like my Well People plantfoliant. I have oily/combination skin that does not do well with a lot acne cleansers. My mom threw as many Neutrogena products as she could at me growing up and they never seemed to work. The first time I found something that I actually liked as a daily cleanser for acne was the Avene cleanace gel cleanser. So thank you Indie Lee for coming through with a great product for sensitive skinned acne-prone oily folks like me :)",

It leaves the skin feeling refreshed and smooth, but seemed to do nothing for my acne. I've gone through an entire bottle now, trying to give it a chance to start working on my skin. Now, I think my old Cerave cleanser did a better job at taming my occasional pimples, as well as keeping them at bay. Will not be purchasing again.",
