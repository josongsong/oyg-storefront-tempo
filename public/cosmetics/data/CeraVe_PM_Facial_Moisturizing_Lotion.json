        "comments": "I am getting older (mid 50's) and have always had dry skin.  This past year, it has become super dry, sensitive and the dry indoor heat during a Great Lakes winter has been brutal on my skin. The sensitivity was making it hard for me to find skincare products that worked and didn't make me feel like I needed to use a flame extinguisher(LOL the site won't let me use the word for flame!) on my face!  I was in Ulta and saw this. The label says it uses ingredients that are time released. The deciding factor was the spf 30 sunscreen in it. When the snow melts, we will be out on our bikes again and I need sunscreen! Spf 30 is the minimum amount you should use and most creams are spf 20.  Plus they feel funky on dry, sensitive skin.  \nHow does it work?  Well, it is different. Not greasy and not conventionally \"emollient\" but it does make my skin look and feel better. It is softer and more pliable.  I am starting to get wrinkly/crepey eyelids and I carefully put this on and let it absorb before applying primer/eyeshadow (besides all over my face).  It has really helped!  I quit wearing foundation and use tinted moisturizer or a BB cream and a cream blush.  Conventional creams are too slick for the makeup to stay on, but the CeraVe reduces the wrinkles, give me sunscreen and doesn't cause the makeup to slide right off.  At night a put it on and put a more emollient nightcream (budget friendly) over it for extra oomph.  In the last couple of weeks, I have had 2 people come up and say that I looked younger and thinner! I will take that all day long!  I have bought every kind of moisturizer-expensive, products from \"parties\", department stores and even used to use creamy petroleum jelly on my face and nothing has ever worked. I have even noticed that I look better and I am usually very critical.  I know this review is long, but if you have gone through what seems like every cream out there and end up giving it away like I have, you want honest, detailed opinions. I hope this helps!",

        "comments": "I use other Cerave products and love those, but this didn't work for me. I've been breaking out with hives, raised welts on my face. I couldn't figure out what it was. I thought maybe it was stress, but then it happened again when I was fine. My skin gets irritated and itchy too. I've had to later on hydrocortisone and take an allergy pill. After reading other reviews with the same reaction… it makes sense.",
