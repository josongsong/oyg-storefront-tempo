And it burns intensely.\n\nI wanted to try this longer to see if it would help reduce my under eye circles but after trying twice, and having to remove the cream due to burns each time, I will just return the product.\n\nThe one likeable thing about this product is the texture of the cream. It is thick but goes on smooth.\n\nThe worst part, besides the burning sensation, is the pump; push down one time and you have more than enough cream for both eyes.  It is so much that it feels wasteful.\n\nI have sensitive skin and most products with Vitamin C cause my skin to burn.  If you have the same experience with Vitamin C, I would not recommend this product.",

It isnt deceptive like MANY brands are where they put vitamin C halfway down the ingredients list or like the last ingredient making it utterly useless. Its the 4th ingredient, which tells me it is likely at LEAST 5% THD adsorbate but dont quote me on that. This also contains resveratrol which is a super potent antioxidant, some would say comparable to vitamin c.\nThis also contains Aquaxly which is a compound of several ingredients that give a silky smooth feeling to the skin and hold in water preventing moisture loss. \nHonestly for such a bargain brand im very impressed with this. The texture is also nice and smooth, not oily but also not so dry that when you rub it back and forth that it pills-definitely not this one. \nIf i didnt know any better i would swear this was made in korea because the texture is so nice like most korean creams. \nHighly recommend!",
