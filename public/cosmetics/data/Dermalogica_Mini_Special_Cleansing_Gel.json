I got pregnant and you know when you're pregnant you can't really use everything so I limited my skin care to really simple stuff such as just normal face cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen and that's it after getting pregnant and after one full year postpartum my skin is thriving no acne at all nothing and I said maybe everything that I was buying to treat acne was actually keeping it and not treating it so using simple skin care really healed my skin I ran out of my normal face cleanser. I said OK let me try this out. Suddenly my face is all acne so I am sure that this is what broke me out because I haven't changed anything in my skin care other than this. Definitely would not buy again.",

I have seen vast improvements in my skin after switching from drugstore back to Dermalogica. I tried drugstore for a while but find this brand worth the investment. Everything goes a long way. The last time I bought cleanser was 5/30/24. I am ALMOST out of cleanser as of 3/18/25. I still have quite a bit left and am convinced I can at least make it to mid-April before refilling. I use the TINIEST drop when cleansing and it gets my face, neck, and chest. Cant recommend this brand enough. Your skin is worth the investment!!",

        "comments": "Let me tell you about my love life. Over the past decade or so, I haven't found been able to find love anywhere within the cleansing department. The cleansers on the shelves at my nearest department store routinely broke my heart. Didn't live up to my expectations. Contained fragrances, colors, beads and more. None of them were my type. What can I say? I'm picky like that.\n\nBut don't get me wrong: there were times when I thought that things could work out. Cleanser after cleanser made promise after promise. One time, I thought for sure that I found a cleanser that could give me everything I needed, but it turns out that by the end of the day, my skin felt oily and my pores felt ashamed.\n\nIt wasn't until my lovely mother took it upon herself to find me the best of the best. Top of the line. You can call it an arranged marriage, if you want (I won't be offended). I'm proud to report that I did fall in love--I fell in love with Dermalogica's Special Cleansing Gel and no longer do I peruse department store shelves. This is it, friends. This is it.\n\nThis gel is so polite. Easy on my skin, you know? It also does not have bad odor. In fact, it's fragrance-free. We get along well; people have been complimenting me a lot lately! I express my happiness by simply saying that Special Cleansing Gel treats me well. That's my motto: \"S.C. Gel treats me well!\" I've even yelled it out of my bathroom window once.\n\nHere's what I have to say to all of you frustrated, perfect-cleansing-product seekers: the good news is, you could fall in love with S.C. Gel, too. Whether your mother arranges it or you make the first move, this gel will be waiting for you.",

It's the one skincare product I have never had to consider changing - no matter what was going on with my complexion, Special Cleansing Gel worked. Until now. The change in my latest shipment was immediately noticeable - fragrance! Not a good sign for sensitive skin. Within three uses, my skin was red and irritated. After comparing the ingredient list to my kids' (older) container, there were indeed changes. I'm so disappointed! Dermalogica has lost a customer and I (and my entire family) must find a new cleanser.",
