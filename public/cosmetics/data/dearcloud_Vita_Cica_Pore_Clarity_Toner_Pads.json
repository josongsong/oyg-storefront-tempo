        "comments": "So far I really like these toner pads. I use them in the evening as part of my skin care routine before bed. I have had no adverse reactions and they seem to be moisturizing. I am a little disappointed that mine did not come with the small plastic tweezers to get the pads out. However my fingers seem to work just fine and will probably repurchase because I want to use for at least 3 months to see if it will help with my sun spots for reference I am 46 years old and have just now begun a skin care routine.",
