I have dry, non-acne prone skin, and this was the worst breakout I have ever had. I double cleansed correctly too, following the exact directions on the website and in YouTube reviews. I tried it twice, and both times, I woke up covered in red pimples. I looked at the ingredients, and one of the most concentrated is  Isopropyl Palmitate, which is a BIG pore clogger apparently. I wouldn't try this if you have skin, regardless of skin type, period. Love bubble, but this one failed me 😔",

I use it on my combination skin to wash off oil at the end of the day.\n\nThis cleanser took the oil off my skin, but I didn't feel like it did much beyond that. My ideal oil cleanser penetrates the subaceous filaments on my nose, and I didn't feel like I got that here, even after like ~2 minutes of massaging it in. \nMy other qualm is that this formula is somehow super dry? It has very minimal slip so I need 2-3 pumps, and it somehow still feels almost gritty. \n\nIt does wash off super well and doesn't seem to have fragrance, so if you're looking for a topical wash, this would be good for you.",

Additionally, even after adding water it barely turns into a \"milky texture\" as the directions state. It did a horrible job of removing mascara and required 8+ pumpe to fully remove foundation, concealer, etc. Two stars because I will use it until it's gone, but i would not recommend.",

I use it on my combination skin to wash off oil at the end of the day.\n\nThis cleanser took the oil off my skin, but I didn't feel like it did much beyond that. My ideal oil cleanser penetrates the subaceous filaments on my nose, and I didn't feel like I got that here, even after like ~2 minutes of massaging it in. \nMy other qualm is that this formula is somehow super dry? It has very minimal slip so I need 2-3 pumps, and it somehow still feels almost gritty. \n\nIt does wash off super well and doesn't seem to have fragrance, so if you're looking for a topical wash, this would be good for you.",
