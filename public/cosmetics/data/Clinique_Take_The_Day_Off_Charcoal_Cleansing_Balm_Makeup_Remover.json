I have oily skin, and the regular actually seemed to help it, so I thought the charcoal version would be amazing. \nIt does leave a film on the face, as did the original, but my toner took care of that. The charcoal version is so messy and will get all over anything it touches, or drips on when rinsing off. I decided to only use it in the shower because of this.\nAll that being said, my skin is happy with it, but I'll probably switch back to the original version.",

No matter how careful I am when using it, I always end up with black hair, black hands, black countertops, a black sink, a black towel. This product makes a HUGE mess and stains literally everything. It smells weird. And the charcoal doesn't actually do anything it claims to, so there's no point for it to even be in the product. I would easily put this on a list of my top 3 least favorite products of all time. \n\nThe original Clinique cleansing balm without the charcoal is great though! Go for that one instead.",

It's really oily and very difficult to wash off completely.  I used it every day to see how it affected my skin. Unfortunately it made me breakout terribly. Maybe I got a bad one? 🤷‍♀️\nI will be returning it and I wont risk repurchasing in hopes it was a bad batch. Back to the drawing board😞",

Since I have both, there's not much difference I can tell you between the two. They both work the same, eitherway the product works great and still very gentle on eyes while still removing all the built up makeup breaking it up easy while dry. The only bad thing I'd say is this that this is NOT your one stop remover and will absolutely need to follow up with their cleanser or you will breakout because it breaks down but it won't clear and wash it all off. Its fine, and I personally like this system leaving me squeaky clean.",

        "comments": "I tried the Clinique Take the Day Off Charcoal Cleansing Balm. It claims to quickly dissolve long wearing eye and face makeup. It also claims to help detoxify, reduce excess oils, and unclog pores. You simply use your fingertips to massage on dry skina¹, then simply rinse off with warm water. It also claims to leave skin clean without leaving behind an oily or greasy residue. First off, I have to say I'm obsessed with a good cleansing balm. It's really my preferred formula for removing makeup at the end of the day. It's very important to me that the balm doesn't burn my eyes, removes everything effectively,  and doesn't leave behind oily or greasy residue. I found this clinique black charcoal balm to be amazing. The balm itself has such a silky feel. It glides across the skin flawlessly, and it breaks down the makeup easily. It doesn't burn my eyes, and I haven't had any sort of reaction from the balm. It washes away easily, and it doesn't leave any sort of unwanted residue or skin troubles behind. I've used various mascara formulas to be removed by this balm, and they all broke down quickly, effortlessly, and painlessly with this balm. Honestly, this is the first charcoal cleansing balm I've tried, and I absolutely love it! I've tried a lot of cleansing balms over the years, and I would have to put Clinique Charcoal Cleansing Balm in my top 3, without a doubt. It's obvious with how easily it breaks down and removes makeup without irritation, balm itself feels silky to touch, and it doesn't leave behind greasy residue. The balm delivered on all claims for me, and I highly recommend giving it a try. I will absolutely buy this cleansing balm again. If you love a high quality balm, then Clinique Black Charcoal is worth picking up and trying! I love the added ingredients of Japanese Charcoal to detoxify, while removing makeup and impurities. As I previously said, this is my first time trying a Charcoal balm, and I am quite certain I like it better than the original formula, as well as the liquid! This balm is such a wonderful product!",

First off I don't like that the balm goes on pigmented and makes it look like your mascara is smudged lol it's very off putting and you have to reapply it a few times to fully take of the makeup and and the balm itself LOL it's not very user friendly  I prefer my cleansers to a have a lather of some sort and this just looks like smudged  mascara. It's hydrating and doesn't leave a lil residue which is good but I feel this would work better if there was no pigment. There's no smell at all and it's very hard to take out the jar especially if u wear fake nails. Ultimately this would be a decent product if it wasn't pigmented!",
