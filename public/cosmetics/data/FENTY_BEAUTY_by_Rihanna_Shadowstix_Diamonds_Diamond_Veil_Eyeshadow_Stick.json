This is just intense (in a good way) right off the bat. I've worn this a few times and the longevity is great. Fenty does it again.",

The eyeshadows glide on without tugging, and once they set, they will not budge. No primer needed. They are waterproof and transferproof. Really pleased with my purchase.",
