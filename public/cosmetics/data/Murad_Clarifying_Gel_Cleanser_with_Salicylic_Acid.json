I would use this in the mornings and was trying to figure out why my eyes would get so watery. To preface, i dont rub the cleanser around my eyes and i use an eye cream at night. I used my other cleanser and i was fine. Ill use up the rest of this cleanser on my body but i wouldnt suggest on your face. It has a nice cooler affect which some people would think it feels more burning. My skin loves salicylic acid but i think its the tea tree oil and parfum being the last ingredient on the list that could be burning eyes. Hope this helps!",

        "comments": "The cleanser itself is okay, it leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed but it does tend to dry my face out and the biggest problem I had was with the largest 13.5 oz size. The pump is completely useless, you get not even a full pump out and then it is stuck in that position so your only choice is to unscrew the pump and get the cleanser off that way. Can be harsh and dry your skin especially the corners of your mouth I'd follow up with a good moisturizer. I think it is way over priced, Murad has always been super expensive.",

I usually have sparatic little red bumps and discoloration to my face.. but lately I haven't had a lot of it. Although, I don't see too too much of a big darastic difference.. I've been cleansing with this and then building a skincare routine with other products, which could also be why there is change at all. I cleanse with this product, spray my face with mario badescu, moisturize, and then put serum in my lashes. I would recommend this if you're looking to start a routine. Consistency is key if you want a product to really work for you though. \n\nIt's approved in my book as of right now though :)",

My theory is this: it's kinda like when you take antibiotics, but not all of them, you kill the lesser bacteria but not the big bad stuff causing it to take off and \"infect\" causing a bigger problem. When I was using this like 1x every other day and literally just putting on and then washing off I started to get cystic acne and more acne than I had from the start. Now I follow my above mentioned tips and the big cystic acne has been 95% healed and no new problems. \nIf this cleanser makes you swell or welp up then I would definitely say it is too strong for your skin, or you may be allergic to an ingredient.\nI hope this helps someone!",

        "comments": "I have been using this cleanser by Murad for many years. About a year ago, they changed the formula. It is now seems to be more watery than the version before it, you have to use more of it than before. I think that it's an expensive product as it it, and for them to change the formula so that one needs to use more is not cool. I thought maybe I had a bad batch, so I continued buying the product thinking I would get a tube of the original stuff. After 5 tubes of it, I realize they just changed their formula. The painted front of the tube also continuously sloughs off when the tube is kept in the shower. May not be a big deal to people who do not keep this in their shower, but it is to me. I do not like labels sloughing off of bottles at all. It makes my shower dirty, and I'm constantly rinsing the bottle, but more keeps coming off. I do keep the tube in a dry area of the shower also. The paint coming off the tube coincided with the new, watery formula. So Murad not only cheapened their product, they cheapened their packaging.\nI will now start looking for a new product to try, one that doesn't require an excessive amount to work, and one that doesn't keep my shower dirty. Too bad, this use to be a really great product.\nBTW, this stuff does not work for my 14 year old son at all. He responds much better to a cleanser with benzoyl peroxide. This stuff did work alright for me. I am a 40 yr old woman with combination skin and acne. This stuff cleared up my acne, but not my hormonal acne. That still flares up monthly.",
