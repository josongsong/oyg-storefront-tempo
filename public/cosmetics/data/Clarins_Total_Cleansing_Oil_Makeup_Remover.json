The only issue with my bottle is it's slightly rancid (probably not stored in the right conditions instore), so I can't comment on the fragrance as it's half-gone. But the product still works well. I don't use it for removing eye makeup, only to remove foundation/concealer etc. The pump dispenses easily, and with a simple twist to the left, it seals shut for travel, the oil itself glides on easily and has a nice silky texture. It dissolves makeup well and it washes off in seconds, without leaving my already-oily skin, any more oily. I then follow with a normal gel cleanser. I've used a couple of oil cleansers in the past and this one is my favorite.

I wear alot of makeup and i always go in with a remover then my makeup eraser to get residue off. This gets eye makeup off with ease and i never was rubbing my eyes with the eraser like some other products. I dont feel the greasy feeling after and i have acne skin, this didn't seem to clog pores. I only needed 1 pump but did two to reeealy spread it around. It's some money but for how long it lasted i am going to repurchase and feel confident that i dont need to work hard to get my makeup off at the end of the day. :)!",
