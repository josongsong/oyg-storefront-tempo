Although it says it will remove mascara, the bottle also says not to get it in your eyes, which is quite tricky to do. My eyes have become sensitive and it does sting them. Furthermore, the travel bottle is designed exactly like the full size and leaked all over my luggage, staining my leather purse that was in there (it was inside another bag and leaked through). To top it off, the lid on the travel bottle cannot be removed to refill with my larger bottle, creating more unnecessary plastoc waste. Will not repurchase.",

The only problem is that after that first use, my bottle began 'growing' little white flaky colonies of floaters.  I'm surprised this happened. I work in healthcare so I'm well-aware of contamination of bottle products. When I first used the product, I did not touch the opening in any way - I merely poured it on to a cotton ball (did not place the cotton ball in contact with the opening). Still, contamination seems to have occurred. I can only surmise that the floaters are bacteria or something of the like. If anyone else has any insight into this, please let me know. I haven't used the product since that first use. I'm too fearful that the things floating in the water may be harmful to my skin.",
