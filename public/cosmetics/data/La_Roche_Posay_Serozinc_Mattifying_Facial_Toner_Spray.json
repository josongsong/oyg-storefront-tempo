It also keeps my skin balanced since I have combo oily skin that is acne prone. I learned that since it helps with inflamed skin, it is super helpful if you get a bug bite because it helps to reduce the redness and itchy skin. Finally it is really soothing if you get too much sun and have a sunburn. Can't say enough good things about this product.",

        "comments": "I was really excited to try this product and especially this brand! Let's start off with a few positives! The first is that the mister on this is amazing and produces a really fine mist. The product also has no scent which is perfect for sensitive skin. The product also leaves your face refreshed without a sticky feeling. \nNow let's talk about the negatives. This product did absolutely nothing for my skin. I used it for two weeks daily as recommended on the packaging. It reminds me of the Evian mist in that it's literally just water meant for 5 minutes of feeling refreshed. I was disappointed because this product is not cheap and I would expect to do more for my skin. I noticed no long term or even short term benefits of using this product.",
