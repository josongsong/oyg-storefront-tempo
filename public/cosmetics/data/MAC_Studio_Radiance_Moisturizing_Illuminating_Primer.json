        "comments": "I would like to love this MAC primer.  I was sold in store when sampled on my hand. Supper hydrated and soft. I love it alone as an extra moisturizer.  However on my maturing skin in my mid 40's it doesn't look great. Settles in my fine lines and all my pores. :( I've spent the last week applying my makeup with different methods, fingers which I know is taboo, brush, and sponge. Every single time same results. After cleaning face and applying moisturizer as instructed as well. I'm so bummed out. I'll be returning this product.",
