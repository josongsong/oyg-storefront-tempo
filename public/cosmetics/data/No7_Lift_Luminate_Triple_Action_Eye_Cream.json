Almost three months later, I'm still waiting to see the results I was expecting. Their website and packaging say results typically appear in two weeks but that was not my experience. Did it lift? Not at all. Did it luminate? A little. This was the change I just started to see months later but to me that is not worth it. PS I'm M/34/Combo Skin Type/ Caucasian with a fair complexion.",

I now use their full line of skin care products. \nIf you are into clean, then this is not for you. Price wise it's good and I'm not in the poor house. \nI had noticeable results first use and I don't do the twice daily regimen they suggest. I highly recommend this for its awesome lifting power and dark circle combatting. It also does a great job on my fine lines",

Naturally, I panicked and knew I had to find an excellent eye cream. After using this product, I knew I found a great eye cream. The cream feels light weight and comes out of the tube in small amounts, so I don't feel like I'm grabbing too much product and having to waste it. I have been using the product for about two weeks and I have noticed a visible difference. My under eyes are no longer puffy, and the skin is moisturized very well. And to my shock, my very subtle crows feet have disappeared completely! I cannot say this product has the power to reverse deeply set wrinkles around the eye, but it was perfect for mine! The eye cream does claim to reduce darkness under the eyes, and I have only noticed a slight difference in my dark circles. Overall, this product is the perfect drugstore eye cream!",
