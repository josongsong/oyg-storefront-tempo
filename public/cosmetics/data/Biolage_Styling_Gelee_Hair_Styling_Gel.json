They have repackaged the product and added a smaller size hoping you won't notice you're paying the same price for a 5 oz bottle as you were for 16.9oz!! I understand prices go up, but a $10 leap in a few months is wild and I'm not falling for it.",

I've used a lot of the more expensive products made specifically for curly hair and they just don't work as well as this. Highly recommend.",

I was previously using got 2be firm hold. When I saw the pink cap and the number 2 hold I decided to try it. I love it. I am growing out a buzz cut and need some control shine and definition. But most gels are hard and sticky and just too much hold no matter how little I use my hair feels dirty. I comb my wet , gelled hair into place and let it dry. Then I scrunch it to break the cast and am left with a neat and tidy pixie that isn't frozen in place and isnt dulled with product, but still holds my deep side part in place , and keeps my hair where I styled it. I understand that people are disappointed at any formula change that is upsetting. I feel happy to have found something that works for me tho. I've been through a slew of gels pomades and mousses trying to grow out my hair and I'm glad to have found it ! I have wavy hair so I'll update how it works for holding curl later when it grows.",
