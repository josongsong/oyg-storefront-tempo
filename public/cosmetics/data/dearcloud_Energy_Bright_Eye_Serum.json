        "comments": "Great product.  I also love the easy clever applicator for this product. You don't have to touch any of the eye serum with your fingers. The product comes out of the tube at the point of the small hole when you squeeze. As the applicator is also metal, the eye serum feels cool on your skin surface as you apply it. This is now my to-go eye serum. I plan to buy again.",

I am fairly new to skincare, however I've tried fresh beauty and clinique regimens and nothing has ever really stuck. \n\nRecently, an Ulta employee (shoutout to McKenna in Leesburg, VA!) set me up with dearcloud products. I ordered this eye serum online as it wasn't in store. And let me tell you, it feels marvelous! The cooling tip is refreshing, the scent is pleasant, and my extreme senstive skin has tolerated it well! Highly recommend! \n\nAlso, I'm really loving the dearcloud new/youth collagen cream, Mediheal collagen pads (pink box), and dearcloud facial cleanser. I'm experimenting with gradually adding in some Anua and Naturium serums as part of the routine as well. \n\nThank you McKenna and thank you dearcloud! You've boosted this chronically ill/sensitive skin 30 year old's confidence!!",
