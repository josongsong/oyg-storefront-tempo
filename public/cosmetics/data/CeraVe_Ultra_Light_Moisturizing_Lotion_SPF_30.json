I didn't know that the formula changed until others mentioned it, and i do notice the product feels lighter, like i have to use more product to feel like i have the amount of coverage i used to. I still like it, and i use other product to help with my oily skin like DM, this is just a great base.",

I also developed whiteheads on my chin and cheeks. Prior to starting this product, I was successfully recovering from a three year acne battle. I am hoping my skin recovers soon and that I eventually find an spf product I can use.",

Great matte finish. Moisture lasts all day. But the pump gotta go.",

Definitely not cool and should have a warning that it will burn if in contact with eyes like that. The regular moisturizer with no spf has NEVER done that and I am a horrible eye rubber especially within the hour or 2 of waking up",
