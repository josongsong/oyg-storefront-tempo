I have tried Belif and Clinique's cleansing balms as potential replacements and now elf. elf gets the make up off just as well as the others. I do think it has a bit of an oilier consistency and a stronger fragrance, but for a fraction of the price of the others it isn't a deal breaker for me. Not as good as the original Farmacy Green Clean, but since tjat is no longer an option, I'll repurchase this one.",

The formula is nice. With the help of a reusable makeup cloth, even waterproof mascara and eyeliner came right off. Until the irritation happened. I used it for four days, broke out, and have red, irritated skin. If you have sensitive skin, don't use this product as the ingredient used for the fragranced part of it may damage your skin.

My makeup melts away so effortlessly and I even use it as part of a double cleanse some nights when I'm not wearing makeup. There is a slight fragrance that personally doesn't bother me, but if you're sensitive to smells keep that in mind.

In the past, I've used a few others including Farmacy's Green Clean but I haven't found one gentle enough to remove my heavy makeup around my eyes without irritating my eyes at the same time. While I always double cleanse after using a cleansing balm anyway, which would breakdown any leftover oil, I like that this balm doesn't leave an uncomfortable film of oil on the skin. I would highly recommend this balm to anyone with sensitive skin or anyone that wears a full face of makeup regularly. It's extremely gentle yet incredibly effective, especially for the price.",

Holy Hydration moisturizer is amazing and I fell in love with it, looking forward to trying their Cannabis moisturizer next! However, one of the ingredients that is higher up on the list (which means there's a higher concentration of it in there for those who didn't know) is polyethylene, which is essentially plastic. Someone else left a review on it saying the same thing, and elf responded saying WHAT the polyethylene was in the product for; what elf didn't say is how polyethylene pollutes our water and damages marine wildlife. While I understand why a big company like elf would use and ingredient such as this for mass production purposes, I would prefer to not spend my money on a product with a known pollutant in it. If elf reformulated without the polyethylene, *chef's kiss* take my money",
