I'll be looking to use more products from this brand.",

        "comments": "I am 49 and have skin that gets mildly dry in winter. I have some sun spots and acne scars, rosacea on my nose, forehead frown lines, and general puffiness around my eyes. Otherwise I always get compliments on my skin and I think it does look younger than its age!\n\nI'm on a budget and trying to to keep a minimal routine, with products that are flexible for a 4-season climate.\n\nI was previously using a CeraVe cleanser that gets the job done, but leaves my skin a bit blah-looking and not feeling quite right texturally. I decided to splurge for my birthday and try this product.\n\nI LOVE that it has no noticeable scent! \n\nSo far (winter) the cleanser is working great I and see no cons. I believe this product will also work well in summer's high humidity. It seems to be minimizing all of my skin issues listed above.\n\nI use a pea-sized amount of this cleanser at night and most mornings for clean, soft, bright skin. I apply it to damp skin with my fingers, then massage and remove with a soft wet wash cloth. At night I follow with either a retinol serum or The Ordinary Multi-Peptide serum, then MB's seaweed night cream. In the morning, I use this cleanser *only* if I did not use retinol the night before. On post-retinol mornings, I only wash with a warm wet cloth (I might also wipe nose and chin with a bit of toner). My morning products are MBs vitamin C serum and Hydro moisturizer (and I usually skip day moisturizer in summer, it just sweats off in the humidity).\n\nI have not experienced any irritation with this cleanser, but I wonder if reviewers who have found it irritating are either combining it with a retinoid or trying to remove makeup with this? I'm no chemist, but this cleanser doesn't feel to me like its purpose is makeup or mask removal - it doesn't have enough slip for that and might turn abrasive. I remove makeup/masks with coconut oil or an oily cleanser first, then wash with this glycolic cleanser to clarify. \n\nI wouldn't recommend this product for daily use by people with moderate to very dry skin, but it might work nicely for a weekly clarify. I definitely do recommend for folks with oily, normal, or mildly dry skin. I had oily skin with cystic acne when I was younger, and I think this would have worked so much better than the harsh products being sold back then that actually increased oil production and made those issues worse.",

It took me a while to give it a try considering the price. I'm happy I made the change. I have hormonal ingrown hairs and extremely dark spots on my jawline and under my chin due to tweezing. This has lightened the spots over 2 years. It also dries out any bumps which I rarely get because I use this. I also think it's an excellent exfoliator. It helps keep my skin so clear it has also caused me to appear a little brighter and lighter. I also leave this one sometimes on my jawline only. Of course, I use the body cleanser now and other items from Mario Badescu, this is my absolute favorite cleanser.",

I have EXTREMELY dry and sensitive skin, lately I've been under an immense amount of stress so have been breaking out worse then I ever have in my life! My esthetician told me that glycolic acid could potentially help with scaring and build up of dry dead skin cells. \n\nI use This every third night followed by the gycolic acid toner, the rest of the time I have been using Mario Badescu Seaweed cleanser and toner! I use a dry skin formulated moisturizer. I have also been taking a supplement l-lysine to help prevent breakouts from starting.\n\nBetween the two they have completely reduced all redness and inflammation, my break out is slowly subsiding and the scarring is fading, all the awful scabs have slowly been shedding leaving healthier looking skin under... I have been using this regimen for 6 days!!! my skin feels smooth and their is a drastic reduction in redness everyday. It feel healthy and happy <3 <3 \n\nI am a believer THANK YOU MARIO BADESCU <3",

I have oily/acne prone skin and I had finally managed to control my acne when I decided to try this product to lighten up my scars. It was a horrible mistake. Instead, I broke out with painful cystic acne all over my checks and jaw line. At first I stuck to it because I thought I was \"purging,\" but after about 5 weeks of use, it wasn't getting any better and I was still breaking out. I won't give up on MB completely, I have used their seaweed cleanser with no issues, but the glycolic face cleanser was just not for me. I have stopped using it and praying my skin recovers soon!!",
