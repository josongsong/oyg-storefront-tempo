I don't have sensitive skin but when I have used products for sensitive skin before they have left a film, almost as if I were washing my face with lotion that didn't want to come off. This had no discernable scent and washed off completely clean. My skin did not feel tight after I dried my face and was surprisingly soft.  I also read up on the ingredients because I was taken aback by the fact that it did not strip my skin, yet cleaned it. It also did not lather too much but it was very thick. The best way I can describe it: it's like a really thick serum. Again, because it rinsed clean I was certain there had to be a common surfactant in there like sodium lauryl and/or laureth sulfate. However, there are other ingredients in there that have gentler surfactant properties. All in all, I'm pleasantly surprised with Aveeno's Calm + Restore Sensitive. Takeaways, no weird smell, excellent consistency, and rinsed off clean.",

First and foremost the texture and consistency of the cleanser is very lotion like in my opinion, it certainly adds moisture but not having a foaming consistency in a cleanser doesn't feel affective to me. I truly don't feel like the product is actively cleaning as I use it. Though the product doesn't seem effective to me in that manner it is most definitely formulated for sensitive skin and it adds moisture and a boost of vibrancy to your face.",
