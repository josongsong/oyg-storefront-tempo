        "headline": "Great for Sensitive Skin and Beginners",
        "comments": "This is my first time using retinol and I've been using it for about 2 months now. For context, I have combination to dry, sensitive skin and I'm in my early 20s. Aging isn't my main concern yet, but I want to start introducing products like this into my routine for the future. I do have some fine lines (from school and working in customer service) and occasional breakouts, but my main concerns are sun damage and hyperpigmentation. I'm very pale and burn easily, and because I didn't use sunscreen consistently as a teen, some sun damage is already visible. I was hesitant to start retinol because I worried about purging and peeling, and I did experience a slight increase in breakouts, but nothing extreme. I began using it twice a week at night with the \"retinol sandwich\" method, applying a lightweight moisturizer or hydrating toner first to prevent dryness, then a pea-sized amount of retinol, followed by another layer of moisturizer. It takes a little practice to spread such a small amount evenly across the face, but I've managed to make it work (Please stick to the recommended amount. Using more is the fastest way to damage your skin barrier). After about two weeks, I tried applying it on bare skin, which my skin tolerated, and then I resumed the sandwich method while increasing use to three times a week, hoping to eventually build up to daily use. I also tried it a few times on my neck following the same method, and it seems to tolerate it well. The serum has a slightly yellowish color, absorbs quickly, and feels weightless on my skin, making it easy to layer with other products. So far, I've noticed slight improvements in the appearance of my pores and uneven skin tone. I'm curious to see if I can get more benefits from it since the concentration is pretty low, or if I'll need to move to a stronger retinol once my skin fully adjusts. Overall, it's been a gentle and effective introduction to retinol for my sensitive skin.",

        "comments": "Back in 2020 when Skincare by Hyram started blowing up and influencing everyone stuck at home during the pandemic, i discovered cerave. I had started using the teal and white bottle of facewash with the pump but i just wasn't a fan of the weird smell. I then discovered this face wash. This facewash has tremendously helped me heal my acne. It helped get rid of closed commedones on my forehead, although now i have some on my chin / cheek area (which is due to using too many acid products, im currently giving my skin a break…) but i genuinly could not choose a better wash and won't ever change it up! They have the 4% which is what i use and then a 10% Benzoyl Peroxide version, i tried it once when it came out which was okay for me but keep in mind it feels more like a lotion than a wash… i just saved myself the extra dollar or so and stuck with the 4%. Anyways, what you can take from this is that this face wash has NEVER let me down 🙏",
