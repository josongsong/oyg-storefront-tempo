I enjoy using this one in the morning to prime my lips and at night before bed.  However, in comparison to other 101s, I do prefer other flavors more, such as the Dulce de Leche Gelato.  But if mint is your vibe, you'll like this one.  The formula is thick but not too thick, and it is definitely moisturizing.",

I've been searching for a decent dupe to them for a while now, and this is a perfect dupe for the Glossier mint balm flavor. The consistency is pretty liquid once it melts with your lip temperature, but is semi-thick in texture which is perfect for my lips. My lips get easily chapped very often and they require consistent lip balm application, so I tend to go for more thick textures… plus thicker textures make my lips feel like they've been swaddled in pillows. This balm is pillowy with that lovely mint tingling sensation that mint balms give. This balm also doesn't taste like anything which is something I personally enjoy as I don't want my balm to contribute to my candy cravings. This balm does have a bit of fragrance from the mint, so be warned if you're sensitive to fragrance.\n\nTLDR::\nI would recommend this if you: \n- want a thin consistency that warms up to your body temperature.\n- want something pillowy on your lips.\n- like thicker textures in balms.\n- don't want to taste your balms.\n- enjoy a minty tingling sensation.\n- love Glossier's lip balms.\n\nI would not recommend this if you: \n- don't like thicker textures in your balms.\n- want something that doesn't give a tingling sensation on your lips.\n- want a balm that has an actual flavor to it.\n- are sensitive to fragrance.",
