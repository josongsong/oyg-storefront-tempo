        "comments": "I recently tried The INKEY List Hydro-Surge Dewy Face Mist and I'm really happy with how it works but there are a couple of things worth mentioning. First off the mist is incredibly refreshing perfect for a midday pick-me-up or to hydrate after applying makeup. My skin instantly feels more plump and hydrated and it has a nice cooling effect that feels great especially in the warmer months.The mist does give a bit of a dewy finish which I really liked at first but it can be a little too much if I'm having a super oily day. Its great for dry or normal skin but for my combo skin I have to be careful not to overapply. I also love that its packed with good ingredients like glycerin and aloe so I feel like its actually doing something beneficial for my skin. Overall I'm really enjoying it but I'd probably reserve it for when my skin needs a little extra moisture or glow. Definitely a good addition to my skincare routine.

        "comments": "This product has been a go to recently I can feel a difference in the hydration in my face its subtle and light and does great just to add a little life/moisture back into my skin. I'd say that it doesn't have a scent but that could just be me in allergy season not being able to smell lol. the packaging is minimal but I like it. The spray radius is small and its fine if that makes sense- I spray it closer to my face than any other facial mist/spray otherwise it feels like nothing is going on my face.
