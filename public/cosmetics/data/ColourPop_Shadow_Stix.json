I love being able to just apply it to my skin without needing to use makeup tools!\n\nI gave it 3 stars because it has ZERO staying power.  Like none!  Even in the inner corner of my eye, where the makeup typically stays put, it somehow disappears 3 hours later.  I guess for the price I can't complain, but I would prefer something a bit more long lasting.  If you don't mind this then it's a great product otherwise.",

I'd compare this to the NYX jumbo eye shadow stick which I also like.  It isn't as long lasting as my Bobbi Brown cream shadow stick or IT superhero shadow stick; but it's also much less costly.  I truly enjoy all my shadow sticks and it has been fun collecting the ColourPop options at such a price.  My favorite thing to do is blend multiple colors from inner eye outward.  I also appreciate how easy they are to use on my lower lid since I have somewhat hooded eyes and don't go for a lot of liner on top.",

I love being able to just apply it to my skin without needing to use makeup tools!\n\nI gave it 3 stars because it has ZERO staying power.  Like none!  Even in the inner corner of my eye, where the makeup typically stays put, it somehow disappears 3 hours later.  I guess for the price I can't complain, but I would prefer something a bit more long lasting.  If you don't mind this then it's a great product otherwise.",
