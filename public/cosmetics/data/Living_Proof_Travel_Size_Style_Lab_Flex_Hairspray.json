This one gives just the right hold: strong enough to keep everything in place but still flexible so my hair doesn't feel stiff. I reach for it all the time when I'm styling my bangs!

This is a multi-purpose product that can be used on wet hair as a heat protector and to help smooth and set your hairstyle as it's being blown dry. It can also of course be used on dry hair to help with heat protection from hot tools and to finish styles with a medium hold. This helps slick backed looks to manage flyaways as well. I love this because unlike other hairsprays, my curls really did hold up significantly longer, and my hair still felt soft, shiny, and bouncy without a heavy, sticky hairspray feel. I recommend this hairspray if you like to heat style and curl your hair! Gifted by Living Proof.",

I am not a user of hairspray because I have dry frizzy hair so why would I put something on it that will add to its dryness? This doesn't and it doesn't look like you have used hairspray... you know what I mean, that crunchy stick dry look that hairspray gives people. I'm not a news anchor or running for public office, I don't like that look. This hairspray doesn't do that, it just makes your hair have that finished healthy shine. I will be purchasing when I run out of this.",

I use Living Proof Perfect Hair Day cream when I straighten and I also use the Perfect Hair Day Dry Shampoo - the scent on those products is great. It smells clean and is not overpowering at all. I'm pretty sensitive to smells, and this hairspray has a different scent than the other products I've used. It's definitely more perfume-y. I won't be returning it, as I've yet to find a replacement, but I won't buy it again. The hold is ok - but it doesn't live up to the other Living Proof products I've used and love.",
