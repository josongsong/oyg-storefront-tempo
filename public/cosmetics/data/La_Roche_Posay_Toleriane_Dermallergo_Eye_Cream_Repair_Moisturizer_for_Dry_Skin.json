I love that this lid has a locking position and that one pump is the perfect amount for both eyes. \n\nThe product is a bit thinner than some other eye creams, which causes it to spread easily. As a result of the more liquid consistency I have gotten it in my eyes on accident when applying too close. Luckily it caused no burning or itching when it got in my eyes.\n\nToleriane Ultra Eye seems to moisturize and nourish well, and my skin feels soft and more elastic with use. It is virtually scentless, so great for those with scent sensitivity. \n\nThe formula sits nicely on the skin and while it feels a bit tacky to the touch once absorbed, it isn't greasy or heavy. It does well under concealer as well. Overall I like the product, especially for the price point.",

This new version smells like they somehow infused the smell of cigarette smoke in the lotion.  It caused me to get a headache and feel nauseated--the same strong reaction I get when I smell cigarette smoke. The lotion also has a sticky consistency, not at all smooth like the original formulation.  I'm very, very disappointed as the original worked wonders on the super sensitive, dry skin around my eyes.",
