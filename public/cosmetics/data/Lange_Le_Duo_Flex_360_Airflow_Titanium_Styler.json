        "comments": "L'ange will always be my favorite brand for curling tools. The Flex still gives great curls'\"though I almost feel like the &quot;tight&quot; setting gave me looser curls, and the &quot;loose&quot; setting gave me tighter ones! Either way, the curls looked great. Two downsides to the Flex are the high-pitched fan noise and the occasional finger burns. With the Classic, you can touch it anywhere'\"it's super safe, especially for someone just learning how to curl their hair. I have the Classic Duo and Classic Grande, and the fans on both of those are much quieter'\"more of a soft hum. The Flex has a noticeably high-pitched sound in comparison. Still, I highly recommend any of these tools!",

        "comments": "Having so many products from L'ange I was excited to get this one too. Unfortunately, it is a poor design. It's a great concept, but does not deliver as advertised. On the highest setting the plates were barely warm. It never got warm enough to wave or curl my hair. Maybe mine was just defective. I could still touch the plates (they were barely warm) on the highest setting. Sadly, I had to send it back. I do feel the barrel needs to be longer, and the curved plate design does not hold even the smallest amount of hair well enough to produce results.",
