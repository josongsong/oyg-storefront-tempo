        "comments": "Super Shock Shadow is one of my favorite eyeshadow formulas! It's a hybrid formula, not quite powder, not quite cream, so you have to treat it a little gently. Great for an easy one-color look or for blending and layering (as long as you are using other colors of the same formula! I find this doesn't play well with others, hence the loss of one star). Also of note: These babies are fragile, so it's never a good idea to order from Ulta online. Buy in store if you can, or if you have to have them shipped order from CP directly as they are aware of the delicate nature of the item and package it accordingly. I broke my own rule recently and ordered from Ulta and it arrived completely smashed. I contacted the help desk, they quick sent out a replacement order, and it arrived smashed as well.",

To hit pan after using it literally 3 days is awful. I didn't think to check the size of the pots before that and now realize how SMALL the amount of product is, it is less than half the amount you get with most other cream shadow pots, so if you compare the value of this to other cream shadows, it comes out as costing a lot more per oz. As a satin shadow where you can use it as a one shadow look, the formula is a bit thick and so you end up using a bit more than you mean to. I'm sad that this shadow won't last long.\nI also got lady bird, which is the glitter formula, and using this as a topper you use a lot less, so this one will last a lot longer. The glitters are all absolutely beautiful, but the colors are really similar.",
