Not sure what its doing, it doesn't have great coverage and just sort of sits on your face so you look extremely oily. Smudges easy. Its a very heavy \"Water based\" so anything thing that isn't, & is worn under will start to peel/seperate. In my opinion its not worth it, but ANASTASIAS wasnt any better.

That made me think that the tinted moisturizer wasn't mixing well with something else they were using on their face and determined that if you do not put moisturizer on before using this tinted moisturizer you will not have that peeling problem. I usually will put on a moisturizer before putting on any liquid foundation, And I bet a lot of people also put on moisturizer before using a tinted moisturizer or liquid foundation but this seems a little counterproductive because you're going to moisturize your skin with the tinted moisturizer... But I have had no issues with the moisturizer peeling or looking strange at all. I also found it to be moisturizing. I use majority of the time a light liquid tinted moisturizer from other brands and really wanted to try out Clinique's and have been very pleased with it. So if you are having problems with it acting strange after putting it on try not wearing any moisturizer underneath this product I have a feeling you might be having an interaction with the original moisturizer and the moisturizer in this product. Hope that helps someone out. I think the color blends well as at first I thought it might be a little dark for me but once I applied it and blended it out it really just melted in my skin. I've used it several times now before posting this review. Will update if I have any issues. I did buy my product online.",

It clung to every single dry patch on my face, so the things I was trying to help camouflage by using it, it just made look worse.  It definitely didn't feel like a sheer coverage.  It also was super difficult to remove, requiring a double cleanse of take the day off balm, then follow up with my foaming cream cleanser to completely take it off. For some people, it may be fantastic! I just seem to not be one of those people.\n\nThankfully, customer service helped me sort things out when I reported my allergic reaction!",
