So you effectively have to lay down while using these, because they dont stay on if you are upright, which makes them a huge pain. They are also very flat and straight and stiff - but your eye area is rounded. This makes it so they only touch one part of your under eyes(in the middle), if you want your whole under eye area to get the coolness, you have to hold it down. So to use these you have to be laying down and hold down both patches the whole time…. No thanks",
