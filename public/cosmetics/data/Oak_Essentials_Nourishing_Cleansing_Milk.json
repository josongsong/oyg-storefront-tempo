        "comments": "It is my hope that this feedback is shared with Oak Essentials.  This cleanser is wonderful, creamy and lightweight.  Does not dry out my skin and smells like a day at the spa.  I am 61 years young with combo skin.  The reason I took one star off is the heavy glass bottle.  Please re-think your packaging to something not so heavy.  Also, the lid slides off easily and that is another issue.  Need to carefully hold it or the bottle will end up on the ground.  Happened to me twice.",

Im acne prone and very senstive and this one has made my skin so happy and glowy and has not made me more oily like most creamy cleansers. I hope they eventually sell a refill pouch or a smalelr travel size option",
