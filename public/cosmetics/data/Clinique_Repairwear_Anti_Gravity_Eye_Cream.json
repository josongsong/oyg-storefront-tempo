I had an awful patch of dry skin on my lid that was a result of a reaction to a different eye cream for over a month so I bought this as a super moisturizer to cure it. It cleared the dry patch after about 3 days and after the first week, I started seeing a huge change in the bags under my eyes and my eyelids started to firm up as well (A bonus since I was not buying this product for that purpose)! My eye shadow even looks smoother. I will buy this product faithfully!",
