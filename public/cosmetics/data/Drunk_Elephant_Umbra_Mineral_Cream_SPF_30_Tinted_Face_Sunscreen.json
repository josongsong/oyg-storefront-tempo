However, this is suppsoed to go on smooth but when I rub it in initially or even during the day, it is gritty. Assuming its the sea salt in the formula. Why even put this in? You dont need it. There is no necessary benefit to it and ruins the product. I bought this despite the other reviews stating this and now im disappointed. Should have listened!",

I always put moistuoriser in before the sunscreen beachse if my dry skin, and that way there is no pilling.",

        "comments": "When it comes to sunscreen, I'm all about formulas that are effective but also a joy to wear—and Drunk Elephant's Umbra Sheer Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 is just that. This 100% mineral sunscreen promises high-performance sun protection (SPF 30/PA+++), while keeping the formula clean and simple. And let me tell you, it definitely lives up to its claims!\n\nLet's talk texture and feel first: this mineral sunscreen is incredibly lightweight and smooth. Often with mineral formulas, you get that dreaded chalky or heavy finish, but Umbra Sheer goes on so seamlessly. It's sheer with a touch of light pink tint, which works wonders to help tone down any visible signs of the zinc oxide without looking like you're wearing anything at all. Plus, it blends like a dream without pilling—so it's a winner even under makeup.\n\nAnother thing I love is the antioxidant boost in this formula. It's packed with skin-loving ingredients like astaxanthin, tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, and ubiquinone that protect against free radicals. Combined with nourishing plant oils, this sunscreen goes beyond just protecting from UV rays; it's essentially skincare in a sunscreen bottle. My skin feels as if it's getting a gentle hydration boost throughout the day.\n\nI have sensitive skin, and I've had zero irritation with this product. Often, mineral sunscreens can be tricky if you're sensitive, but Drunk Elephant has nailed it here. I can confidently use it daily, knowing it's giving me the protection I need without any discomfort. I also love that it's available in multiple shades—just another way Drunk Elephant is making suncare accessible to everyone.",

        "comments": "This is the first drunk elephant product I have ever used and I purchased this myself with my own money from ulta in the shade cocoa and I'm conflicted. I do feel like, color wise, it's one of the best mineral sunscreens i have ever tried. I don't feel like it leaves a white cast and it blends pretty decently into my skin tone. You can still tell there's a little something on my face because it does look a tiny bit pale by itself, but if you put a little powder over it, it looks great. \n\nThe pictures I include have my plain face, a swatch, the product not fully blended, the product blended, and the product with powder over it. For reference I'm the shade nw48 in mac studio fix powder plus foundation / 21 in fenty eaze drops. \n\nIn addition, it does not burn my skin or eyes. I wore it all day on my face, including directly on my eyelids and I did not feel any irritation on my eyes at all, which I normally feel with sunscreens. I had an itch or two on my face, but that's normal for me. The main thing I look for is burning and my skin did not feel like it was burning at all, which as someone with sensitive skin, I appreciate that. Moreover, so many products have hyaluronic acid these days, and my skin is sensitive to that, so I also appreciate that this product does not have that in it.  \n\nThe thing I don't like about this product is the texture and difficulty blending. It has a grainy texture that does not feel good at all when you are putting it on. I'm not sure how to describe it, but the closest thing I can think of is, that it kind of feels like that st. Ives scrub we used to use back in the day, only not as bad. There are no visible beads in it or anything, but it has a gritty texture when you're rubbing it in, and I'm afraid it might be too harsh in the long run. I'm not sure if it's exfoliating my skin and I'm really working on repairing my skin barrier, so I'm unsure of how i feel about this product. I was on the fence about returning it, but I think i will probably keep it to see how I fair with continued used. \n\nAgain, I like the color (for a mineral product) and the fact that it doesn't seem to irritate my skin throughout the day, but the texture when putting it on is just so off putting that I'm unsure about it, especially since it takes quite a bit of rubbing to get that decent blend with the skin. I would say I rubbed it in for a good 5 minutes to get this color that I think looks decent, and while I was rubbing it in, it looked streaky, so at the end, I pat it into my face to finish it off. And be warned that it is pretty messy. So don't wear something white or touch any white surfaces while you're rubbing it in because you defintely need to thoroughly wash your hands and get the product off before touching anything.\n\nStill, I would say it's worth a try because, let's be honest, the mineral options for us darker skinned girls are limited, but I'm just not sure if I would repurchase it. I think I will keep it and use it up because I do like how it looks under my mac studio fix powder plus foundation. It looks very natural with a little powder over it, but on its own, and the texture while applying it makes me feel unsure about it.",
