I try to only use it 1x a day since exfoliates. After a week I saw improvements and was getting compliments. I'm a basic sunscreen with tint, blush and mascara gal and I truly love how my face looks at this time. I've been using it now for 3 months and this is on my subscription. I enjoy the smell and the feel, have no prob with either. I am 45 (46 in one month), sensitive, acne prone, very dry skin.",
