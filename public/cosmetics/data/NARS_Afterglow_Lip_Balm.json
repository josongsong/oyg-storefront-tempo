It applies easily, gives an instant wash of color, and feels weightless on my lips. It will transfer so if you're looking for something that's going to last you all day without reapplying this isn't for you. But if you're looking for weightless hydration and a nice wash of color this is where it's at.         I got this in the shade Dolce Vita which from the reviews I've seen is one of the more pigmented shades.",

Perfect amount of color for a sheer product - noticeable and subtle at the same time.     The cons: cost/product ratio. This is a pretty small amount of product for the price. The picture below shows lip balm brand-new out of packaging and turned all the way up.         This would be my daily product if the cost was more reasonable. As it is, I only use it sparingly because replacing is so expensive.",
