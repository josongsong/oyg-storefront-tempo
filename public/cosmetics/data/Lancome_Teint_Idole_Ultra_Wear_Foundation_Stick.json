I have normal skin and didn't experience any creasing, transfer or caking with this foundation. It would be absolutely perfect of not for the poor shade range and terrible packaging.\n\n230 is the lightest yellow-toned shade and although I can make it work in summer with some bronzer and highlighting, it's actually a full shade darker than my natural skintone and I'm not even super pale. The brush end is also useless and a waste of packaging. For the price, I would rather have more foundation and no brush end.",

        "comments": "I really want to love this foundation!  The foundation itself is great!  The brush is ridiculous!  It's too tapered to blur well and too stiff to blend around eyes and nose.  The cap for the brush end doesn't stay on either.  It's very annoying!  Also when you wind up the stick to apply, it doesn't lock in place.  It instantly rolls back down.  It is so weird—maybe I just got a bad one…?\n\nBut if I were to rate on the foundation, I would give it a solid 4 maybe even 5 stars.  It goes on easily, the color matches perfectly and stays put all day!  I've been using it alternatively with dior and merit stick foundations to see which I like best and the Lancome would probably win if it wasn't for the poor packaging!",

I have used the liquid foundation for many years in 220 Buff Cool; and was a fan of the old foundation stick in 220 Buff Cool as well.  My complexion looks best with a cool shade; 220 Buff Neutral in the new stick is a totally different color.  I have used Lancome products for over 30 years and it seems that they are constantly changing products that I have come to enjoy and rely on.  Please stop!!",
