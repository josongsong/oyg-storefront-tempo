A little goes a long way and it feels super silky smooth while washing (both pros) but it leaves a thin layer of film on my fash after washing, like a cheap bodywash leaves you sticky. My face feels tight, but not clean and refreshed tight. It feels sticky and unwashed. You HAVE to use a moisturizer after. I'll stick with my $8 pink grapefruit face wash.",
