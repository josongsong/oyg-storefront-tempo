I had REALLLLLLYYY dark circles and fine lines but with this product they are reduced a lot (still there but not as noticeable). If you are looking for a product for dark circles and fine lines, look no further cause this stuff works! I get that it's very expensive but it's SO good I would totally buy it again, plus you use a pea size amount so it would last a really really long time! :)",

A few weeks to notice. But once it happens its stable and even clarity. I get comments from family of what I'm doing different. Now I think it's expensive. But I've tried other things and did not get anywhere near the same results. So sometimes you just got to pay for the good stuff.",

My eyes were so puffy and irritated and scabed from constant itching!!! Underneath my eye were so dark and puffy I found that it worked best for my dark circles but it dried out my skin so much to the point I had to use hydrocortisone and see an-aesthetician because I developed what she said was a milia? (White bumps) I am still not exactly sure what made me react to it so badly but it's disappointing because the product really worked for me for a while! Be careful and stop immediately is my only advice if you do purchase! Read label for possible allergy information!",
