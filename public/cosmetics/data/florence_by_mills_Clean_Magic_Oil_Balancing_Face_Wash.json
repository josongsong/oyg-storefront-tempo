This has a very thin/milky texture even though it looks thicker when I put it in my hand. The scent is cucumber melon which I wasn't expecting. It's not bad just not my preference. I haven't had any skin reactions thankfully and my face does feel clean after use, just not a fan of the feel of the actual product.",

Other reviews say it didn't get their makeup off but it did mine...or at least my mascara. I like Millie's toners more to be honest though. They gave more result. This cleanser was eh compared to them. But then again...its not THAT bad. Calm down guys.",

        "comments": "First of all, I have been looking for good skincare for teens for many years now that is clean, not many chemicals, and is kind to the skin. This cleanser is perfect for teens as it is gentle, soft, and cruelty-free. This cleanser unlike most I've tried cleans the skin very nicely without stripping the skin of all its natural oils. One of the cons is some people that have sensitive skin are having reactions to the product. I say if you have sensitive skin stay away from this product but if not it is completely amazing! Another thing I would like to add is after using this product for less than 2 weeks, my skin was clear! I used the clean magic cleanser, dreamy dew moisturizer, and the zero chill face mist. The scent completely blew me away when I first tried it because it smelled so refreshing and calm! The face wash wakes me up in the morning and gives me a fresh start to my day. I would not recommend this to adults since Millie specifically made the brand for young teens. The packaging was beautiful and the box it comes in has a cute quote to make you feel confident. \n\n*BOTTOM LINE*\nGreat for teens who don't have sensitive skin.",

        "comments": "This is my first review because I felt so compelled to let others know. I am a beauty product fiend and have tried hundreds of face washes on my quest to clear skin. I am in my early 30's so I was reluctant to begin with as this brand seems geared to younger women but it does say all ages. While it seems gentle and I appreciate a clean cruelty free product (hence the 2 stars), this face wash DOES NOT REMOVE MAKEUP. I thought maybe I didn't use enough so I went for another dollop. Things did not improve with more product. I am shook due to the hype around this line not to mention it's already sold out. As another user stated, I had to use 10 cottons pads soaked in toner and 2 eye makeup remover pads just to get my skin feeling halfway clean and even still I feel like I should re-wash my face with my regular Kiehl's cleanser. Guys, trust me, don't buy this if you wear even an ounce of makeup and want a clean face. If this was marketed as a second step or there were other cleansers in the line it may be a different story, but this is their ONLY face wash, so there's no reason to believe it shouldn't clean-your-face. I will be returning the first chance I get. Super sad as I wanted to love it!",
