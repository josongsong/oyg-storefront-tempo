I tried this product first by itself with no other styling products just to see what I was working with, it tamed the frizz a little and had a small amount of hold but didn't last past a couple hours and past that it was like I didn't have any product in my hair at all. Next I layered it in under my usual stylrr (Miss Jessie's Jelly Soft Curls) and I got the soft bouncy curls I was looking for! My hair was way better with this underneath than just using Jelly Soft Curls alone! \n\nI use this Innersense product more like a leave-in conditioner, after my shower I squeeze all the extra water out of my hair then comb this through from root to tips. I add just a touch more water to get my curls to clump again and then micro plop as much moisture out as I can get with a really good microfiber cloth. Last to go on is the Jelly Soft Curls and I diffuser dry. I'm so glad I cracked the code with this Innersense cream since it's really expensive, now I don't style without it.",

        "comments": "I actually really like this product. The smell isn't my favorite, but it's light enough that it's not offensive. I like this because it provides definition for my 3C curls, without needing gel as well. I end up with soft curls regardless of if I 'seal' them in! After using this product exclusively to style my hair for the past 2 weeks, the one thing I have been more aware of is its lack of slip. It doesn't make my hair feel silky, and I feel like I should wash it more - it almost feels like there's a build up. But! I will say, it seems to rinse fairly clean and maybe this is part of what its like to use all natural products? Silicone added a lot of slip to my hair before I used this product, but that also causes build up, so who knows. Anyway, at the rate I'm using the product and with how expensive it is, I've recently started using it alongside a cheaper drugstore leave in conditioner to help extend the life of the bottle, and it's still doing it's thing! The price point is a bit high, but it does work wonders on my hair, just not sure if I'd say it's doing better than my drugstore faves.",

I like this because it provides definition for my 3C curls, without needing gel as well. I end up with soft curls regardless of if I 'seal' them in! After using this product exclusively to style my hair for the past 2 weeks, the one thing I have been more aware of is its lack of slip. It doesn't make my hair feel silky, and I feel like I should wash it more - it almost feels like there's a build up. But! I will say, it seems to rinse fairly clean and maybe this is part of what its like to use all natural products? Silicone added a lot of slip to my hair before I used this product, but that also causes build up, so who knows. Anyway, at the rate I'm using the product and with how expensive it is, I've recently started using it alongside a cheaper drugstore leave in conditioner to help extend the life of the bottle, and it's still doing it's thing! The price point is a bit high, but it does work wonders on my hair, just not sure if I'd say it's doing better than my drugstore faves.",

        "comments": "Purchased for my thick somewhat course, somewhat frizzy, somewhat curly hair. Find that my hair feels heavy, almost wet after using it (using only a dime to a nickle size dollap). It's not particularly frizzy hair weather here in new york. The real test will be in April when the humidity kicks up. I use this to help straighten my hair when I blow it out. If I use too much my hair looks like a grease pit, but the ingredient profile is so good and so clean that I can't give it up completely. Feel the same way about the conditioner and shampoo that I purchased for my hair type, but again, the product is clean and I feel good rubbing something so healthy for me into my scalp. Just not thrilled with how my hair feels after using it. It feels heavy which isn't bad as long as the frizz is controlled but it is fuller which isn't what I wanted. I have a lot of body and a lot of hair (I'm blessed). I wanted something to give me a sleek controlled flippy look when I blow it out. Really on the fence about all of my Innersense products. But I thinks its great that you make such clean healthy products. Just not in love with how my hair feels and looks. :(",
