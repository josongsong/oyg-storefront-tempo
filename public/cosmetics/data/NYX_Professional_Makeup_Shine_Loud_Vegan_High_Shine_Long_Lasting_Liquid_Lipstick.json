        "headline": "Transfer-proof and lasts FOREVER",
        "comments": "Just like the title says, this lipstick is basically transfer-proof and lasts through basically anything. This lipstick will last through swimming, eating oily foods, and an entire day of sweating in summer heat without moving even a little bit. Sometimes I'll forget to take it off at night and just touch it up in the morning and keep wearing it. I ate oily food truck tacos in this lipstick and expected the oil to completely obliterate this lipstick — because usually even my high end \"long lasting\" lipsticks can't withstand food truck tacos — but it was still PRISTINE after. I'm super impressed with the formula for this product. \n\nThe \"Shake Things Up\" grape color is also my absolute FAVORITE lipstick color EVER. I love the versatility of that perfect, warm purple because it's subtle enough to wear to the office but edgy enough to wear to the goth club. It's been the first liquid lipstick I have ever used completely through because I wear it almost every day. \n\nUnfortunately, I accidentally bought the \"Make It Work\" plum color instead of \"Shake Things Up\" grape color when I went to replace it because I was shopping elsewhere and didn't realize that the color I had bought originally was an Ulta exclusive. The \"Make It Work\" color is very pretty, but it's more of a dark rose than a plum, so I was a bit disappointed when I saw it in person. And even then, my only real complaint with \"Shake Things Up\" is that I feel like calling it \"plum\" is a little misleading.\n\nFormula-wise, though? AMAZING. My favorite lipstick of all time. I plan to replace my \"Shake Things Up\" as well as get the blue and green colors at some point in the future, and I hope at some point Nyx decides to add a black in this formula because I desperately need a black lipstick that has this kind of staying power.",

Goal Getter is a gorgeous deep rich almost-maroon, and will be my go-to. Boundary Pusher, as seen in the attached picture, is a warm, subtle, brown. They last as promised; I'd say they are comparable to the big-name pioneer in all-day two-coat lip color, though somehow easier to remove at the end of the day. NYX, you hit it out of the ballpark with Shine Loud!",

After only 4 hours of wear and a non-oily meal, the lipstick starts to flake all over the place. Forget about the inside of your lips staying in place ha no that quickly ends up transferred onto teeth instead. The gloss is fine and covers the uncomfortable, spackle-like sticky texture of the lipstick after it \"dries\" and even holds up for that initial, internet-worthy hand kiss to prove it's not going anywhere (ya try a few hours later). Wasn't even doing anything which involved friction to my lips or oil to break down the formula. Overall, extremely disappointed I wanted to like this product so bad. The photos below are after blotting 4 hours after application…yuck.",
