If you can get past the smell give it a shot it kept my oils at bay all day i will say. Im in arizona heat so its super dry out here but with my combo skin this stuff seems to do the job. So far no break outs but i havent used it long enough to really determine that.",

        "comments": "A few years ago, I developed extremely sensitive eczema and rosacea prone skin out of nowhere. I'm sure my skin conditions are symptoms of my autoimmune conditions because I also get hormonal acne that's almost impossible to treat topically.      My usual skincare products are around 3x the price than this, and I hadn't even heard of this brand, let alone considered trying it before a friend recommended it to me. And honestly, despite the good ingredient list, I really wasn't expecting anything when I first tried it. But shockingly, I loved everything I got.      I started out applying this as one of the last steps in my routine before bed, and I was amazed at how this lightweight moisturizer was able to keep my skin supple throughout the night. But don't get me wrong, I wouldn't consider this product an occlusive at all. it's more hydrating than moisturizing.      I grab for now during the day now as well. I actually prefer it more for daytime use. Currently, summer's just beginning and the weather in my area is already a sweltering, humid 95 degrees. I love applying this in the morning because it has such a refreshing, cooling, silky, gel-like formula that doesn't pill, feel heavy under or sweats your makeup off, or cause any extra oiliness throughout the day. It feels even better kept in the fridge!     For reference, the formula/ texture/ results of this moisturizer is very comparable to Purito's Sea Buckthorn Vital 70 Cream and their Deep Sea Pure Water Cream.      This's great for those who have combination or oilier skin types and want hydration without feeling weighed down. However, if you have broken skin or a compromised/ damaged skin barrier, like from eczema or something, this may sting a little when first applied. I mean for the price point, it's amazing!",

The formula is nice and lightweight on the fingertips, and I like that the packaging gives you a perfect dose. Unfortunately there was a layer that just sat on my skin all day and never quite fully absorbed. It does a great job at controlling oil, but after a few days my skin started drying out. Lastly, I started breaking out in the little red spots that for me indicate a reaction. After that I had to switch back to my old moisturizer.",
