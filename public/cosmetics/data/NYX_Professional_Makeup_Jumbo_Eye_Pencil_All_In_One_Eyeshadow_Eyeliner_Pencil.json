I personally don't mind it as much when I'm just trying to lighten up under my brow or maybe add a little bit of brightness to my cheek instead of doing a heavy glitter highlight but I would not use it as an eyeshadow pencil at all. strictly as an eyeshadow, this IMO is a major flop. I've had a couple colors and been using for a little over a year off and on and I'm just not feeling it. not to mention I didn't realize it will have to be sharpened... somehow?? will not buy again and I don't recommend buying..",

It wears away easily and its not a deep rich black, it smudges and runs. For sure not a HG product. \n\nMilk is good to use as a base, which is sadly the only thing its good for. It makes ANY color more true to pan when applied first. I find that if I use it in my waterline it smudges/runs/fades as well as when I use it for regular eyeliner. It can be difficult to apply evenly (when used as a base) and can get blotchy fast, if to much is put on. Blending it out can be a bit of a pain too, even when used with a regular primer underneath. Its not a HG base either. I think its hyped up for nothing.",
