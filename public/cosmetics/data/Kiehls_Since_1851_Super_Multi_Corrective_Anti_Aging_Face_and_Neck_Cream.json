While the price tad is high, the big container last me 2-3 months depending on the weather. \n\nI would recommend you get a sampler size and try it out for 3 months because you wont see any instant results. After 6 months of using this product, it cleared my blackhead and slowly seeing results in other areas.",

        "comments": "The fact that a lot of the bad reviews state that this moisturizer makes their face oily made me chuckle, in a sense that most people with oily skin actually age better than the ones with dry skin because they are able to preserve moisture better. The goal of skincare should be to nourish, repair, rebuild and refresh cells, especially the vital protein chains that power them. I was actually shocked to see a product in the market that's first few ingredients didn't contain dimethicone, or worse, glycols. (glycols may have effects including brain, liver and kidney abnormalities.) I was also relieved to know that most of the ingredients I could point out, or at least know what the properties were and why they are in there. So you want to complain that your skin is oily, and your pillow is oily? How about you thank kiehls for not putting terrible things into its products and giving you what a moisturizer is supposed to do! This product is amazing. I love the way my skin glows when I apply it, and my skin is noticably more perfected.",

They discontinued this product (PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!). Kiehls suggested I use the super multi-corrective cream as a replacement. Never again. The thing that is strange is that many customers are reporting this same burning/stinging sensation.  Apparently this product used to work, but the new forumula causes stinging for many. Please do not discontinue products that work and please don't change the formula of products as well.",
