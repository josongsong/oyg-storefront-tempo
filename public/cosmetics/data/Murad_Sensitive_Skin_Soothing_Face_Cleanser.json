I spent MONTHS and so much money looking for a new face wash but they all either broke me out or burned my face due to my sensitive skin. Tried high end and drugstjre but nothing seemed to work. Gave this cleanser a shot as a last resort and saw amazing results within the first use. I kid yall not i havent had a single breakout since buying this and its such a good amount of product too. This is coming from someone who has EXTREMELY dry sensitive skin, i 100% recommend.",

I loved that there wasn't really any scent to the cleanser. I find that scented products can irritate my skin so I found it super helpful that this cleanser wasn't scented. I also noticed that there weren't any suds when washing my face, and my skin felt more moisturized and nourished after use. I've been using this cleanser in the morning and at night and it has been so helpful in for easing my skin irritation and calming my skin down.

I was gifted by Murad to try their Sensitive Skin Soothing Face Cleanser and it has been such a pleasant experience! I have super sensitive skin so this cleanser is absolutely perfect for me. I loved that there wasn't really any scent to the cleanser. I find that scented products can irritate my skin so I found it super helpful that this cleanser wasn't scented. I also noticed that there weren't any suds when washing my face, and my skin felt more moisturized and nourished after use. I've been using this cleanser in the morning and at night and it has been so helpful in for easing my skin irritation and calming my skin down. Overall, I think this is the PERFECT cleanser for anyone with sensitive skin and I cannot recommend it more!",
