My skin felt dry & tight, which caused additional irritation. I was planning on returning it but it fell to the bottom of my purse & I forgot about it for months. \n\nCurrent opinion:\nIf I dont roll it too close to my waterline, and I only use it on the puffy part of my under eye skin, I have little to no irritation. Ill also only use it if I'm going to be in a photo or in the media. I dont use it daily, but when I use it, I can use it multiple times a day.",

I roll it on just like they said outer inner. Do it twice, tap it lightly in to smooth it into your skin. And then I use all my other products. It feels great, it's nice and cool, but it really does nothing for my eyes at all.",

Well, I've use it for two months, twice a day as part of my skincare routine before applying makeup. However, I stopped it for a week and that is when I realized how good it really is. My eye bags were very prominent to the point that my conceler can't even hide them. Now I went back to using it again and I am not stopping this time. it really works.",

I talked to my grandma shortly after I bought it  and she too had bought it in hopes it would do what it had promised but did not work for her either. I wouldn't recommend this product and I normally am very happy with Clinique!! Bummer",
