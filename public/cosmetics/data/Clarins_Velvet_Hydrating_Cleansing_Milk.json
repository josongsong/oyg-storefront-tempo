On the 4th day using this  I had a severe allergic reaction.  My eyes were so puffy, and I didn't even use to remove eye makeup. My skin has welts and is so red an itchy and painful. If your skin is sensitive do not buy. Also, it should specifically say on the bottle that it is a chemical exfoliant. There is Citric acid listed.",

I love ALL of your products and the only skincare products I have used in these 30 plus years.\n\nMy complaint is not the product \"Velvet Cleansing Milk\" but the new container.—the top will not snap closed.  The blue milk cleanser that I used for years had a screw on top—no problem.  I have been trying to snap it closed for 5 minutes now and I have given up.  This was true of the bottle I just finished.  I was smart enough to have bought bottles of the blue milk cleaner so I didn't know the new one would be SUCH A PAIN!!!  It's sooooo frustrating! \n\n Please use the original container.  It's not worth the few pennies you might be saving.  Your products are excellent.  Please don't lower your standards by using cheap and inferior  storage containers.\n\nKnowing your standards of excellence and customer satisfaction, I am confident that this matter will be addressed..",
