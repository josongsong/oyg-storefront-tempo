I would only recommend if you have extremely fine/thin/straight hair. Other than that, you wont get much use out of this.",

I have fine wavy hair so being able to adjust the temp down to 285 was huge for me (the GHD is set at 365). I also appreciate that the brush on the conair is bigger which results in faster styling. While I wish it was quiter, ultimately the health of my hair was more important to me than silence.",

I purchased this hair tool with the idea in mind of having a blowout that gave the effect of having velcro/ hot rollers in a quicker time window. \n\nI will say that I sectioned my hair, applied heat protectant and brushed the tool mid-length and wrapped the ends around the tool and rolled the brush up imitating a hair roller. I used the middle range temp (230F?) and let my hair sit for 15 seconds. By doing 15 second increments, with a total of 24 sections across three layers, I am able to style my hair in 10-15 minutes. \n\nI am not giving 5 stars since there is sound on this hair tool. I have since upgraded to a different tool, but if the sound does not bother you, I would recommend this to anyone.",

My hair retained a soft wave and good root volume for a few hours with no hairspray, style retention may vary on different hair types and if product is used for hold.

Ensure you brush hair prior to styling and I recommend heat protection when using hot tools. My hair retained a soft wave and good root volume for a few hours with no hairspray, style retention may vary on different hair types and if product is used for hold. Looking forward to seeing how this brush holds up with daily use!",

First time I plugged it in at my hotel it shut off, and is now broken. Frustrating because now I'm out the money and have no way of styling my hair on my trip. Althought the tool says 120/240 V the plug itself says 125V which is very misleading.",
