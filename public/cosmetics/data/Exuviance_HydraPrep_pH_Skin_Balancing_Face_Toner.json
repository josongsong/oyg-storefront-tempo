I told a cashier I was looking for a quality toner than I could use on my skin. At the time I thought I had dry skin but she informed me that my skin looked like combination skin. After being skeptical, I bought the product. I have to say it smells very good. Almost like cucumbers. It does work very well for clearing your pores. Especially the ones on my nose. The only reason I give 4 stars is because I am unable to use this everyday. It breaks me out, so I only use it at night, every other night. If you have the financial state to buy a morning and night toner I would certainly buy this and use it for night usage! overall, I was very happy with my purchase and will continue buying for my nightly routine!",

I walked into an Ulta Beauty in Florida and asked the Rep for something to keep my skin balanced and not stripped but clean and comfortable, balancing out my combination skin. She brought me the Exurviance Moisture Balancing toner,  I was skeptical but it worked for my skin and helped with my pores, they were clean and my skin felt refreshed. This toner doesn't have an overwhelming fragrance either.  I have kept this in my arsenal because my skin loves it. I have been through a lot of trials with toners but this one remains my main squeeze, my go to, my old faithful.",
