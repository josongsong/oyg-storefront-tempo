Its not noticble enough to immediately take it off my face but there are instances through the day where i want to scratch my face. I think there might be an ingredient in here that is causing this reaction. It does its job though. Very glowy and buildable coverage. I would recommend this for someone who doesnt have sensitive skin. Also if you gave oily skin use a matte primer. Trust me itll help you out.",

I've tried so many things to the point where even mineral baby sunscreen makes my skin reactive. I finally am able to enjoy makeup again with this foundation! I'm so greatful for this product :))\n\nOnly con is that it doesn't last all day, however also put a very light layer on. Even with a light layer, it looks seemless and matches my skintone perfectly. If you have very sensitive skin like me, please try this because it really impacted me positively. I'm able to finally feel and look beautiful when I wear makeup and not worry about a flare-up.\n\nThis is great for the summer! Fingers crossed that it hold up in the winter as well and does not react with my dryer skin in the winter :))",

        "comments": "I've tried so many skin tints because I recently developed a sensitivity to an ingredient in my go-to tinted sunscreen. I prefer something low maintenance like a skin tint, but I have oily skin, so they often don't last. This lasts most of the day at least now in winter, if I set it with a powder and do occasional blotting. It's medium coverage, yet somehow the shade seems flexible? It's the only tint I've tried that truly does seem to blur imperfections. It doesn't completely cover them, but skin looks noticeably more even toned. It does go on sticky, which might be a dealbreaker for some—if doesn't have the serum like texture of other tints—but it does dry down after a while. It's dewey, so may not be a fit if you're super oily or want a matte finish. I found it best to use my fingers and use a little at a time! I think part of the explanation for the low ratings is that people are using it more like a foundation and painting it on and that's way too heavy handed for this. Also this is a much better price point for the performance as opposed to other skin tints. I think it's worth a try.",

        "comments": "I had high hopes for this skin tint after seeing so many glowing reviews on YouTube. The claims of innovation, hydration, and a glowy finish made me want to run to Ulta to try it out. Even the girl working there was excited about it—but unfortunately, they didn't have her shade.\n\nI picked up shade 5, which wasn't a perfect match but could be made to work with some bronzer and blush. Right away, I noticed the coverage was insanely sheer—like barely there even with multiple thin layers. If you love ultra-light no makeup coverage, this might be for you, but personally, I was expecting a little more. \n\nThe texture leaned more dewy than I anticipated, bordering on greasy on it's own no powder. It didn't sit great around my nose, emphasizing fine lines instead of smoothing them. And the strangest part? When I lightly pressed my cheek, I literally saw my fingerprint in the product. That was… unexpected.\n\nI ended up returning it and will be trying something else instead. I wanted to love this, but it just didn't work for me.",
