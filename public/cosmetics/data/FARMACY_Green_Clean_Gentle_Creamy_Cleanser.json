        "comments": "For some reason, the last few years, my skin has become incredibly sensitive and reactive. After eliminating pretty much everything but cleanser/moisturizer/spf in the day, I'd been using an oil cleanser at night that I didn't love and I think caused congestion, because the many others marketed as gentle cleansers I tried were irritating my skin visibly way more.\n\nI quite literally almost stumbled into this product on the end-cap in an Ulta recently, and to the employee that steered me to decide on this one and not another I was considering, I hope your pillow is always cold and your phone is never low battery and the stoplight always stays green for you. I LOVE this product because it cleans my skin, doesn't strip or feel tight, doesn't irritate my skin, doesn't break me out, and is cruelty-free. I love this enough that I will absolutely repurchase despite it being more money than I would like to be spending on a face wash. That said, I've been using just a pea sized amount at night and it's been plenty so I think a bottle will last me a while.",
