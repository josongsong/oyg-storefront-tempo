Neat bottle with a twist to open and close cap. No cast to scrunch out and I ended up with soft and moisturized curls with just this product alone.\n  \n  I'll pair this with some gel and should have the perfect amount of hold!",

It definitely looked like you were able to twist and open from the where there is a line in the middle of the cap but actually you just twist and open from the base, so I thought that was a poor design chose and can be confusing. For the overall product itself, it was very hydrating but gave no definition or bounce to the curl itself. Although it's super hydrating and there was no \"crunch\" texture it did make my hair a little frizzy. Overall, it's a nice product but not sure if it's a repurchase.",
