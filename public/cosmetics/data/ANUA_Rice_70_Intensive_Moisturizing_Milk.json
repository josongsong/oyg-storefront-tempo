It is hydrating, gives me a smooth skin texture, no fragrances, almost clean ingredients but hoping they can replace for example the 1,2-Hexanediol with natural. The Diglycerin is questionable for me if it is made of natural or just synthetic so (who knows!). \n\nPretty satisfied with how it works for my dry, sensitive skin. \nYou can't go wrong with rice bran, it always satisfied me.",

It easily distributes and melts into the skin leaving a bouncy glass skin glow. Its made with key ingredients of rice water, niacinamide, ceramides and squalane. The packaging is sleek and easy to use, minimal but informative. I've use this product on its own, with the rest of my skincare rountine and also under makeup for an extra glowy appearance. Overall I really enjoyed this product. This product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review.",

My skin instantly feels soft, hydrated, and soothed, and it leaves behind the prettiest natural glow. The 70% rice extract helps brighten and even out my skin tone over time, and I've definitely noticed a more radiant, healthy look. It layers well with other products and doesn't pill under makeup. Perfect for sensitive skin days or when I need something simple but effective. This is one of those moisturizers that feels like skincare and self-care in one—gentle, hydrating, and glow-boosting.",

It's not greasy at all, which is fantastic since I don't like using heavy creams. Just a small amount goes a long way, making it great value for money. After using it for a few days, I really felt a difference in how my skin looked and felt.  Rice is known for its hydrating properties, and I believe it really works! My skin felt nourished and loved after each use. Plus, it has a light and pleasant scent that's not overpowering. It's refreshing, almost like a spring day. I appreciate products that leave a subtle fragrance without making it seem like I've dumped a whole bottle of perfume on myself. I received this for my honest review.",

I drink a lot of water but my skin still needs a lot of moisture. My skin tends to be very dry, itchy, and the texture can be uneven. It can be a struggle to get my skin to hold moisture. Immediately after using this moisturizer my skin does feel slightly more plump and moisturized. There's no fragrance and I found the formula to be slightly soothing. When I felt the very watery and thin texture of the moisturizer I knew it wasn't going to be thick or rich enough to be my every day moisturizer. My skin soaked up the moisturizer and went back to looking dry too quickly for my liking. I think this would be best for those with normal to combination type skin.

        "comments": "This ain't your average rice water hack. The Rice 70 Intensive Moisturizing Milk is what happens when ancient skincare traditions meet luxury K-beauty innovation. It's lightweight like a serum, but moisturizes like a cream — and I mean deeply. The texture is silky and smooth, perfect for layering in a routine or using solo when your skin just needs a quick sip of something nourishing. What I love most? It brightens without being harsh. Rice extract helps even out tone and soften the skin over time, so your glow isn't just surface level — it's real, healthy, and lasting. Plus, it absorbs in seconds with zero stickiness, so your skin just feels smooth and plump, not coated. Ideal for oily, combo, or sensitive skin, and a gem under SPF or makeup.",

I pour a little into my hand and it feels soft and silky. When I apply it to my face and neck after washing, it spreads easily and absorbs in a minute. My skin feels gentle and plump right away.\n\nAfter two or three days I noticed that the dry spots around my cheeks and forehead looked calmer. My face felt more even and less tight. I like how it gives a soft glow without any shine. At night I use it before bed and in the morning my skin feels fresh and more balanced. It works well under sunscreen and makeup in the day.\n\nI have skin that can be sensitive and it did not cause any red marks or breakouts. It feels soothing and gentle, kind of like a light hug for the skin. I like that it is not heavy or greasy. It leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.\n\nI really like how easy and simple it is to use. It fits well in my routine and does not feel like a chore. I like that it gives soft moisture that lasts without feeling coating.\n\nThis product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review.",

It is hydrating without being too thick, and layers well under makeup - no pilling, no grease. It feels really hydrating, and like it's actually being absorbed into my skin. Great daytime moisturizer. This product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review",

As someone in her late 20s focusing on preventative care, hydration and fighting hyperpigmentation are my two key focuses in skincare.\n\nThe Anua Rice 70 + Ceramide Intensive Moisturizing Milk kind of shifted my original impressions of this brand. For reference, I have oily/combination skin.\n\n🍚  The packaging of this sleek and easy to use. Aesthetics-wise though, it pulls a little clinical at first glance but I can see the apothecary-inspired angle they were going for. \n\n🍚 The formula is surprisingly lightweight and absorbs well. This is such a pro for me as I have combination/oily skin type. I found this perfect for use in the hot weather as my pores don't feel congested.\n\n🍚 I've noticed a visible reduction in oiliness after using this for about two weeks. My skin looks and feels more balanced, and my makeup applies more smoothly.\n\n🍚 This moisturizer contains rice water, rice extract, and ceramides. I'm particularly a fan of rice-based skincare as it was one of the first skincare type to even my skin tone. Some great skincare ingredients included in this are niacinamide (brightening, anti-acne, moisturizing), phytosphingosine (anti-acne, skin-renewing), rice bran oil (antioxidant), Allantoin and Ectoin (for soothing).\n\n🍚 This would be great for any skin type as it does not contain irritating ingredients. For the price it retails for ($20), I think this is well worth the price and would consider repurchasing this. \n\n*I received this complimentary in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts are my own.",

I drink a lot of water but my skin still needs a lot of moisture. My skin tends to be very dry, itchy, and the texture can be uneven. It can be a struggle to get my skin to hold moisture. Immediately after using this moisturizer my skin does feel slightly more plump and moisturized. There's no fragrance and I found the formula to be slightly soothing. When I felt the very watery and thin texture of the moisturizer I knew it wasn't going to be thick or rich enough to be my every day moisturizer. My skin soaked up the moisturizer and went back to looking dry too quickly for my liking. I think this would be best for those with normal to combination type skin. This product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review",
