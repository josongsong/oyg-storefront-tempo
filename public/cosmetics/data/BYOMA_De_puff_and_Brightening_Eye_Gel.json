        "comments": "The price for this eye cream indicates its performance level. I know I purchased this eye cream for less than $25.00. Rule of thumb, you should never be depending solely on eye cream to get rid of the appearance of dark circles - the magic potion is sleep! But if you want an eye cream that will perform noticeable results, you should expect to spend anything over $50 to $75. I did not see any results from this eye cream - it just was a lubricant barrier. I work a stressful job primarily on computers and aim to get 7-8 hours of sleep per night, so those also play a factor. I did read the most positive helpful review. I have sensitive combo skin. I did not report feeling any sting from this product. On the other hand, the most negative critical review was very eye opening for me (no pun intended!) because I did not realize you could even break apart the product. I write my product reviews when I'm done with a product. I thought I had used all this eye cream a month ago. When I opened this eye cream, I still had ONE THIRD of the product left! The straw didn't even reach the bottom! I hope this isn't some sneaky marketing tactic by Byoma. Hats off to whoever made the bottle, but it's ineffective. Life hack, if you aren't getting anything out of the pump, bang the can on a hard surface and it will come out. It's also possible to fit a Q tip in there.",

The container arrived broken and I tried for 10 min to make it work! I had to tear it completely apart to use the eye gel and When I finally was able to access the product it was just ok! It made my under eye area feel dry and I didn't notice much difference in the depuffing of my bags! Quality control needs to ensure that the bottles work correctly cause a customer doesn't wanna spend money on a damaged product!!",
