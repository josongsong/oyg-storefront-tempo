Heart is a beautiful natural sheer taupe blue pink color. Like that tik tok of the famous \" get the bunny togue color \" hype. This is exactly that color. Natural hue of deeper pink but subtle and shiny in its gloss. This is a zero sparkle lip gloss balm.I have the worst dry lips, and can I say even if you have peeling skin coming off your lips you dont have to worry about that bc the balm gloss is thick enough to soothe and level out dryness that you may have. Bare Minerals! Please never stop making this product. I cannot live without this and there is no other lip gloss replacement for it.  Dramatically yours, NM",

I have an active 13 month old and I'm tired, haha! I love this gloss because it gives everything I need and it's so easy to apply quickly. It has enough color and gloss to look PRETTY but not so much that I need to take my time and make sure my lines are perfect (who has time for that?). Also, it's absolutely hydrating. I can't imagine why anyone would think otherwise! I don't need any primer or anything (again— I don't have time for that!). This is the perfect everyday lip color. I would love for them to make more colors (a warm red for Christmas/ wintertime would be amazing!!)",

I would go every year and purchase the sets. I would probably buy 3 to 4 sets every year because it is the only lip gloss that worked well on my lips. I went into bare minerals in September and they notified me that they were no longer available. So I went to the outlet hoping that they would still have some. They did not either I cannot find the original anywhere. This new stuff is not the same and it stinks in the smell. I am highly allergic to all types of scents I just don't understand why you would get rid of such a perfect product. It's not like it wasn't selling I don't understand it sold perfectly. I have looked everywhere to try and find the regular bare minerals lip gloss please bring it back please please please bring it back you're doing all of us such a disservice. Whoever your sales and marketing person did a complete fail in this aspect they need to bring it back. If you do bring it back please reply to my email address I am putting it in the information and that way I know I can buy it and that way I know I can buy it",
