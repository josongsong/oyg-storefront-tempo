AND the opening is big enough that you can refill it (if you have the full size). Or refill it with anything, really. But highly recommend!!!",

        "comments": "I've seen the most results from the oil cleanser and their clay and acid face mask (not apart of this set). The other products two products are kind of lackluster and don't justify the expensive price (in the full size). The moisturizer was very underwhelming, and the face wash was drying for my combination skin. I like the oil cleanser though. That's the only thing I recommended out of these products.",
