It's not sparkly or orange or muddy or chunky, and it's very fine and silky so it melts in really well and doesnt look dry or powdery or accentuate fine lines. The tones are really tought to figure out, though… I have fair/light slightly olive skin and the lightest shade is barely a bronzer, it just looks like a badly matched powder foundation. Medium is super dark with a brick red/brown undertone, medium deep is somehow lighter than medium (?) and much warmer, almost yellow… so I have to wear medium deep and be really careful not to use too much. They definitely need to offer a light/medium shade to bridge the gap. Great formula.",

NOW, the current version of the 01 Light is the PERFECT color on my fair/medium skin with brown hair/eyes. I can't go out tanning, so I rely on this over my BareMinerals foundation.   Has a slight \"frost\" shimmer to it, but not glitter!  I get compliments on it all the time!  HOWEVER, the MEDIUM 02 does have SOME GLITTER in it, so I returned it even though I liked the color.  I'm a 43 yo girl, so past the glitter phase...not a lot of glitter, but too much for me (see pics).  Ordering a second LIGHT 01 I love it so much (even after using Nars, Hoola, etc).  I spare no expense to get a \"good\" no-makeup look and I LOVE this 2018 version of the Light bronzer! Finally!!",

I thought it would be an awesome little bonus, but no matter what I do I cannot get this bronzer to work for me! It has so little pigmentation it's a joke-I've had better bronzers that were one tenth of the price. I have to dig to get any product onto my brush, even when I swatch with my fingers the color barely shows up! It also has huge chunks of glitter, which I just don't understand why that would be in a luxury product to begin with. Overall, disappointed with this, I will not buy this and will stick with my PF Butter bronzer.",
