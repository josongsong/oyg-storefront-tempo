It never clumps or flakes. It lengthens, adds volume, and separates lashes. The brush is also the perfect size and the formula has a great consistency. I have sensitive eyes and this does not irritate them. Thank you Lancome for making such an excellent product.",

This mascara had a nice dark black color but after curling and applying my lashes immediately went straight. I don't recall this mascara smudging throughout the day so that's one nice thing. I received this as a sample but I would not buy it.",
