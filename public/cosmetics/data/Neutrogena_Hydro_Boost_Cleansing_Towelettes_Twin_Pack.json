It's nice and refreshing, especially in the morning and makes me feel put together. But that's really it. Even after using morning and night for a week I don't actually see any difference in my skin. It sort of reminds me of an este launder serum I used to use, it smells and feels similar, it just doesn't actually brighten. I'll probably keep using it just because it smells nice and makes me feel like I have a routine again but I wouldn't buy it.",
