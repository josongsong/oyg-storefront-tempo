I've used them twice and will prob attempt a third. Forget using the spatulat that comes with it to hygienically get them out of the jar. Never gonna happen. They slip all over. Which brings me to my next point. I'm sitting and every 30 secs or so, I have to slide the one eye mask that has a good amount of serum, back up to under my eye bc it just constantly slides down my face. I need masks where I can still do things, especially if they want you to leave them on for 30 mins. I leave all of my eye masks on for awhile when I can, but don't always have that extra time. I will say the other mask that I purposely chose w/o a lot of serum, hasn't, but the point is to have serum \"soaked\" masks. And idk if it would move while moving around- I can't do it bc of the other eye mask. \n\nI'd say that my eyes aren't dry after I take them off, but hydration isn't remarkable.\n\nI've been crying a lot due to an important person in my life passing away, so I have been buying excessive amounts of eye masks.   \n\nI would not purchase again even if the entire jar was $5.",

The cut out that is supposed to fit under you eyes is like a half circle. Unless your eyes are small and perfectly round balls, these will absolutely not fit correctly. I can realy only get these on my upper cheeks and outer crows feet area.. not under my eyes where i need the hydration. \n\nAnd they slide around so much. There is so much serum on them, plus the masks are so thin, that they will move from where you put them for the first 5-10 minutes, until they start to dry. Annoying. \n\nI'll go back to my reusable ones after i finish these up",
