I have very sensitive skin and it only occasionally has a mild or minimal redness or sting with it. it does have a heavy alcohol scent but when you see how well this product works none of that will matter to you. not only does it help my EXTREMELY oily skin stay plump but oil free throughout most of the day, it also will help take off any grime or dirt you didn't wash off your face before.  I'm going ro be buying this for the foreseeable future. it is my favorite and the best working skin care product I have.",

Take it SLOW, use once every 3 days, after 2 weeks or so, try using once every other day, and go back to every 2 days if need be, figure out what works for YOUR SKIN! Take it slow, or you could cause more damage and chemical burns(the redness & burning and itching some are speaking of). It works, but only works as much as you allow it. Again...SLOWLY, work your way up, some may only ever to use this twice a week and rotate with a gentle toner. GOOD LUCK!",

I just cannot get past the smell. It literally burns my eyes and I hold my breath to use it. I've now discovered that it's burning my skin as well, and I know this is what's causing it because my skin only gets raspy after using this product. I didn't get this reaction at first but now that i've been consistently using this in my routine i notice the red itchy hive like bumps on my face for hours. My face has always been SO sensitive, so i'm sure this is a factor too.",

I bought them at ULTA from a rep. for my extremely oily skin. I ended up having my nose peel quite a bit. After talking to Katie online she suggested level 3 instead. I might go to a 3 if you have sensitive skin. Love the face wash and gel though. If your new to this line id suggest talking to the chat. They can help explain the products and best way to use them! I learned so much. I loved how clean my face felt just was to strong",
