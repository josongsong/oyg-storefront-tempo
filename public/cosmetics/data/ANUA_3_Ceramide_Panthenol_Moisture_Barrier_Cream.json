There's Vitamin B5 (panthenol). \nI did use this together with Intensive Moisturizing Milk Lotion and for more hydration. \nThere's some good natural ingredients as well that helps my skin but I can't say this is going to be my favourite.",

From the first application, I noticed the texture was very heavy and greasy, and it didn't absorb well.\n\nAfter a few days of use, I started getting breakouts in areas where I don't usually have acne, especially on my forehead and cheeks. My skin also felt congested and looked overly shiny, even when using a small amount.\n\nIt might work better for extremely dry skin types, but unfortunately, it didn't work for me. I stopped using it and my skin started to improve.\n\nI wouldn't repurchase or recommend it for sensitive or breakout-prone skin.",

        "comments": "This past winter, my skin decided it wanted to freak out. My acne hasnt been this terrible since my teens - deep, painful hormonal breakouts on my cheeks and chin. I developed psoriasis along my hairline and ears that was painful to the touch. I tried a lot of products over the past 7 months and while my skin isn't perfect again, I finally have a regimen down that has seems to keep my skin calm and happy. My main concern was delivering moisture to my skin to keep the psoriasis at bay, without causing more breakouts in the process, and without being too heavy for the humid Chicago summers. \n\nThis moisturizer is incredible! It's very rich, but not too heavy for daytime wear. It does take a while to fully dry down, but it doesnt pill with other products and makeup looks dewy and smooth over top. It doesn't feel like it's suffocating my skin. I am a very sweaty person and I never feel like I have the dreaded sweat mustache that a heavy moisturizer will usually give me. \n\nFor nighttime, it's a dream. I usually slather on a thick layer to seal in the rest of my skincare, and again my skin feels soothed and not smothered. I wake up with glowy and bouncy skin and any redness I had before bed is significantly calmed down. \n\nI love it and I will repurchase again and again! A little goes a long way. I've had my first tube for over a month and I'm barely half way through.",

I have been using this product for three days now (morning and night), and it's definitely my new holy grail! I personally have combination skin that gets oily when I use thick moisturizers and dry when I use thin moisturizers. This product is the best of both worlds, in the sense that it moisturizes my skin without making it oily, while simultaneously calming my skin which is important if u use adaplene gel.

It's in between thin and thick consistency, takes a bit to rub in, and doesn't have a smell. It leaves a film on the skin that does eventually soak in but I don't enjoy having to wait to lay down. In my opinion you're better off using Cerave because my other moisturizers do a much better job.",

A little goes a long way! The cream sinks in quickly, leaving my face feeling soft and hydrated right away. No sticky residue! Plus, it contains ceramides, which help strengthen the skin barrier, and I love knowing I'm doing something good for my skin. I also appreciate the way this cream feels under makeup. It provides a nice base, allowing foundation to glide on smoothly without clumping. My makeup looks fresher throughout the day, and I don't notice any dry spots peeking through, which is a bonus!Overall, I think this moisturizer is a fantastic option for anyone looking to boost their skincare routine without breaking the bank!

My skin feels lovely after applying this and it absorbs quickly so when using it at night it doesn't transfer onto my pillow while I'm sleeping. I also appreciate that it's non comedogenic so it doesn't cause my skin to have further issues.  I received this product in  exchange for my honest review.",

        "comments": "This moisturizer has become my daily driver. My super ultra dry, sensitive itchy skin LOVES this formula. The moisture lasts for days and my skin looks more plump and less stressed out. The formula is about the texture of a cream and it sinks into my skin without leaving it looking or feeling greasy or sticky. My skin looks moisturized and slightly radiant after I use it. There's no fragrance as far as I can tell which I appreciate. The packaging is clinical and scientific looking, very easy to use and keep your hands clean as well. I think this moisturizer is fantastic for people with dry skin and mild wrinkling like me. This product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review",

After using this and another cream from Anua, I noticed that Anua kills it with the moisturizer game. \n\n⭐️ This ceramide based cream is rich and thick enough without being comedogenic, and provides such relieving care to the face. I noticed that it calms down puffy red face in the morning and makes my skin look even and glowy. It absorbs very easily too!\n\n⭐️ The cream has these little beads that dissolve while applying it. These encapsulated beads are filled with ceramides, which means you're getting a fresh doese of active ingredients everytime you apply this. These small details make such a difference.\n\n⭐️ This is alcohol-free and fragrance-free formulation that is suitable for all skin types. For context, I have combination/oily skin, and this helps my skin stay under control. I don't get a greasy look from using this either.\n\n⭐️ Some noticeable beneficial ingredients in this include:\n- centella asiatica extract (antioxidant, soothing)\n- ectoin (antioxidant, soothing)\n- ceramides NP (skin-renewing)\n- glycine, serine, alanine, arginine, proline, threonine (amino acids that contribute to skin-renewing on a DNA level)\n- panthenol (soothing)\n\n⭐️ Packaging-wise, I like the simple and minimalistic look and feel. It has a subtle apothecary-style vibe, which I'm a fan of. Compared to some of the brand's other products, it doesn't look cheap or tacky. \n\n*I received this complimentary in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts are my own.",

From the first application, I noticed the texture was very heavy and greasy, and it didn't absorb well.\n\nAfter a few days of use, I started getting breakouts in areas where I don't usually have acne, especially on my forehead and cheeks. My skin also felt congested and looked overly shiny, even when using a small amount.\n\nIt might work better for extremely dry skin types, but unfortunately, it didn't work for me. I stopped using it and my skin started to improve.\n\nI wouldn't repurchase or recommend it for sensitive or breakout-prone skin.",
