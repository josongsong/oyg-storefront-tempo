Scientific studies show rosehip oil can reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and dark spots.Snow Mushroom (Tremella Fuciformis Extract): Snow Mushroom is a dynamite hydrator as it can hold up to 500 times its own weight in water and the particles of this extract are smaller than most extracts allowing it to easily penetrate the skin.Ceramide 3: Ceramides are used to replenish the natural lipids that are lost from exposure to harsh environmental factors, the use of drying products, and the aging process.

Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly so you have to work fast but when it dries, man i tell ya i love the texture on my skin. Smooth. A little goes a long way with this one. I also use 4 other products from dime. I can't definitely see results in two weeks! My skin has a glow to it, my husband noticed it when we video chat and he says \"are you using a filter? You're so glowy!\" Of course i said no lol that's when it clicked that dime products actually works!!! Will continue using dime. I love dime products!!! See photo for before and after pictures.",

The first two orders they kept sending me the same \"wrong\" product - the Hyper Glow instead of the Hyaluronic Serum (perhaps change the packaging so the employees don't keep grabbing the wrong one?) Because they won't mail you the right one until you've gone out of your way to send them back the wrong product they sent to you.   My last order was made Oct 5 and showed \"label made post office waiting for package\" for 7 days! I finally emailed them on the 12th to ask what gives?! They just sat on it for a full week and likely would have never of sent it if I didn't contact them. The same day I contacted them it shipped (on my door step two days later.)   The problem is, it's always something these days, which makes it too hard to do business with them. I'm too busy to be fixing their errors and making sure they're doing their job.",
