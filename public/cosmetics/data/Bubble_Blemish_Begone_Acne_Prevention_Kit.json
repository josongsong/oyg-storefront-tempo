It contains one of my favorite cleansers which is the Fresh Start Gel Cleanser which leaves my face squeaky clean and refreshed after use. The acne treating serum works great in targeting my acne spots and I have seen improvements in them fading away since I started using this product. Not to mention the knock out acne spot treatment I use both products together and they have been doing wonders for my acne prone skin and I also use them consistently both day and nights. The Level Up Gel Moisturizer compliments this routine as it helps to give my skin a smooth and hydrating finishing touch. Honestly I'm happy I was introduced to this set by Bubble because I now have products that has proven to help my skin concerns. Bubblegifted",
