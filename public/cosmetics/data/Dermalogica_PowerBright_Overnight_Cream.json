It is expensive, and requires consistency (nightly application) and a few bottles, but it definiely does work. I continue to use it on spots as they appear or after a pimple and my face looks far better than before! Highly recommend!",

I have tried so many products over the past several years, including a very expensive one from the dermatologist, and nothing helped. The only thing that helps a bit is to get BBL treatments, but that's painful and inconvenient and still doesn't make the spots go away for good.\n\nI'm just finishing up my first bottle of this and I have noticed a significant lightening of all my sun spots including the big one. It isn't gone by any means, but this is the first time I've noticed any difference, so i had to write a review. I feel like my skin just looks better in general. I am going to purchase another bottle now so I don't run out!",

I have never seen so much progress from a brightening product and I have a lot (Caudalie Vinoperfect, Skinceuticals Discoloration defense and Vitamin C, Skin Medica, Clarins Double Serum, Sente, you name it). This product is superior to them all AND its moisturizing. Thank you Dermalogica.",

So basically I have been beating through the torture of red, itchy skin for nothing.  If you have anything close to \"sensitive skin,\" stay far, far away from this product.

I think my brown spots may be slightly less noticeable with my short use...I think if I could afford the full size of this (and the serum) and use it for longer that the results would be more noticeable.",
