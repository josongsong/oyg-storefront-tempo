I could not get my curls to stay, so I consulted with my hair stylist to see what she uses and she recommended this Kenra product.  I blow dry my hair first, spray the piece of hair that I want to curl and then release the iron.  The curls turn out bouncy and not stiff.  After the curls are cooled, I will spray some humidity barrier product on the curls and run my fingers through my hair.  Kenra 13 helps with volume, texture and holds the curls.  I also like that when I wake up, my hair has volume too-  I love this product and am so glad I found it.",

While I used to use their strong hold during my working years, I have started to use their Perfect Medium which describes the product beautifully. My hair is medium length, baby fine, and color treated. I tend to spray more on the crown to keep a little lift, but use sparingly all over. It is the only spray that works for me. I also love that it does not leave a scent because of my allergies!  If you have never tried this line, give it a try. They have a full line of wonderful products.",
