        "comments": "This product seems to work well enough to remove daily sunscreen and occasional makeup. I use as Step 1 in a double cleansing routine. I bought mine months ago and I still have plenty left. My eyes are pretty sensitive  but if I expose them to an irritant bit by bit, they usually get used to the product over time. Not with this stuff! I absolutely dread taking my eye makeup off with this. It stings every single time. Sometimes my vision is a bit blurry afterwards which I think is more the dissolving makeup + product getting in my eyes more than anything. But my eyes feel red and irritated for a while after using this stuff. Won't be buying again but my skin likes it enough to keep using it until it's gone.",
