I did my makeup per usual and decided to set my entire face with this powder and I am speechless at how blurred and velvety matte i feel. It minimizes the appearance of my undereye finelines and smile lines. The biggest test for me besides wear of course was how my bronzer and blush application wore and they worked amazingly. I am a very oily skinned woman and found that this powder stepped up the game against my holy grail powder: Huda Beauty in shade cupcake. I am thinking to combine these two powders for the ultimate all day/night wear. Mac, you did great on this product and please never discontinue this powder.",

        "comments": "As a dark skin woman, I absolutely loved this powder. I felt the color match was accurate for me. I felt that the design was absolutely beautiful. I loved that it came with the powder puffer, and that it had the powder shield, however, a con for me was that the shield, when using the puffer only dispense a small amount of powder, so that takes up some time of having to push on the shield multiple times however I felt that when using a brush, I got more powder out and was able to get an application done quicker. I feel that when I use this powder in comparison to some of my other powders i.e. Morphe this has a better experience. I do like how the Mac powder was not as shiny or has like a glitter/ highlighting undertone like the Morphe powder so it didn't provide as much shine to my face when using the powder with my particular brand of bronzer and blush however, it's just about personal preference and that's what worked for me. I loved how the shield was there, so although I have the shield as a con is more of a con in terms of using the powder puffer I absolutely love this design because I can open up this product and know that I am not going to have my powder goes spilling everywhere which is a 10 out of 10 especially when traveling. I loved how it has a puffer that can go in the powder case and that whole design aspect of it because I can take that and go and it's going to fit in in some of my smaller bags and with my lipgloss cards financial cards in my phone in my cards my keys. I'm good to go and I don't have to worry about not having something to reapply my make up with or touch up my make up absolutely love that design, even though it takes a little bit longer to apply I like that it's all compacted in one thing versus having multiple tools to apply the application a 10 out of 10 product I definitely will recommend definitely an amazing purchase!",

        "comments": "I've tried a lot of different setting powders and this is the first I've found that makes my base look significantly worse! I've been doing makeup for 9 years so it's not an application issue, trust me. The texture is quite light and doesn't feel cakey but it wears horribly longer than around 3 hours. I have oily combo skin and find at the end of the day the makeup on my entire T zone is completely separated and looks awful. I'm about an NC5 for foundation and MAC doesn't make a concealer light enough/with the right undertone for me so I use a mix of Too Faced in Cloud and Dior Forever Skin in 00 Neutral for a bright undereye. Every time I've applied the 'white' translucent powder, no matter what method I use, my undereye concealer immediately turns orange and about 2-4 shades darker. It doesn't affect my foundation the same but I notice it actually removes some of the coverage, something I've never seen a translucent powder do. IMO this powder won't work for anyone who can identify with the statement: \"most brands don't make complexion products light enough for me\". It will leave you sad and a little orange with weirdly dark undereyes. I wanted to love this so much but this is the second MAC complexion product that's really disappointed me, really wish their lightest products were light enough for us pasty babes lol.",
