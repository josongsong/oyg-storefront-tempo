Glides like butter and keeps my naturally curly hair frizz free! My hair stays super silky with this compared to others Ive tried. No issues of weird smell or burning my hair. It curls beautifully also. But makes my hair super shiny and doesnt snag. For the record I have 3a/b curls & live in FL w/ high humidity. I advise buying in the store to test out n make sure the plates align and fully touch when squeezed together. As ive noticed w/ all straighters if they dont you will have uneven results and itll cause snagging.",

        "comments": "I don't understand all the bad reviews. My guess is user error or receiving one from a bad batch maybe?? But this is by far my favorite straightener ever. I've had mine for 4yrs now and it's still like new. From day 1, it glides down my hair like butter leaving it silky smooth shiny and straight. I dont have any issues with snagging like I always do with other straightners. And it curls beautifully. Been contemplating buying another just to have as backup in case this one dies at some point and my luck this one ends up discontinued. I have 3a/b curls partially thick with some fine areas. And I only need one pass to obtain great results. The matte black finish is also soft and aesthetic. I love it b/c after trying others, the sweat or product build up from my hands will cause my hand to slip when using. But this has a great comfy grip. I just make sure to always clean it with a damp rag  after to keep it clean & looking new. I've also noticed that my hair stays silkier when I use it vs others. It also frizzes less somehow, and I live in FL.  My advice is try for yourself. And buy it in the store to examine it first, as I've noticed w/all brands that the plates don't always line up perfectly (like when squeezed down so the plates touch) which can cause snagging and uneven results.",

It heat up quickly, my hair felt smooth and held the styles for the majority of the day. But whenever i would wrap up the straightener to put it away there was always an issue. After a while the protective cover for the wires were exposed and then it just stopped working. I always made sure to wrap up the wires with not much tension so this wouldnt happen but unfortunately it did. Once the wires were exposed, it would turn on for a few seconds but then it would turn off. My straightener before this one lasted about 8 years before I had to replace it so pretty disappointed this only lasted about 2. My only complaint is that I wish it lasted longer!",

I had heard that ceramic was better if you want a smooth look for thick hair, so I did some research and found this one. It is slightly heavier than the titanium, but the difference is negligible. I have thick straight hair that likes to poof when air dried and it's stubborn when it comes to holding curls. I tried this iron for both straightening and curling and it runs smoothly through the hair with no snagging. Compared to titanium iron, this one actually does give either style a smooth look - yay no frizz! \n\nThe price point on this thing doesn't diminish the quality you get! I was lucky to get this iron for around $50 after a discount. So happy to have this iron for under $100! And it is equivalent to a CHi or any other higher priced brand out there.",

This works great as a touch up tool or if you're hair isn't 3B or higher curl. Tried it out on my sister's wavy medium length hair worked beautifully. Would recommend on wavy hair types. If you have any high curl or deep wave hair types I would pass on this one.",
