I didnt need an entire new kit since I already had a couple bonds, seals, and removers. But I was eager to spend the extra cash if it meant it would extend the wear on my favorite quick lash. The new lengths and volumes are wonderful, but I am completely disappointed with the lack of longevity. These come off with water quicker than the regular ones. And yes, I used all the adhesives.",

Might as well get real lash extensions at that point. I did like the variety of lashes in this kit. I think it might be worth it for a day maybe 2 (if you can make them last that long), but at that point I might as well buy lash sections and apply them like regular false lashes. They're cute.",

The bonder will make your eyelashes clump together and no matter how many false lashes you put on, your own clumpy lashes will be the shining star of the show. Oh and on top of that, you put on 2 more bond and seal layers to make the lashes look even worse! The idea if this product sounds so great but the end result is just trash. Save your money and go buy a good mascara. Im grateful that I bought an eyelash growth serum in the same order because lord knows I need it after this mess.",

        "comments": "This is the perfect eyelash kit. You get so much variety and can create so many unique and more personalized lash combinations. These are pretty easy to apply but I would recommend watching videos for tips and tricks just so you know how to properly do it efficiently. I would also recommend a spot test on your skin for the glues just in case you are sensitive. \n\nNow to the lashes. They claim they last up to 14 days of wear and I can't testify to that because I never had them on for more than a few days. Although they were comfortable and they actually stayed on with no problems for a few days (correct application is key to their longevity) I didn't like to have them on for more than a few days because you do have to be careful around them and I just like being able to freely wash and rub my eyes. You have to make sure to avoid cleansers and makeup removers with oils in them because that would affect the glue and even though it wouldn't completely take them off it would cause lifting and things to just not look good. On that note, using the provided lash remover is very important to guarantee you are getting all the glue off and to avoid damaging your actual lashes. With the provided lash remover it was very easy to take them off. They also claim that you can re-wear them up to 3 times with proper care and I would say that really depends on the state of the eyelashes after you take them off and if you are able to actually clean them properly. I also liked that you can buy the lash refills separately so you don't have to buy the whole kit and you can just buy the lashes you prefer.",

        "comments": "Okay, I was SO excited about these. I was however quickly humbled by the application process. My first try lasted well over an hour, and left my eyes burning and raw. The remover oil does take it all off relatively easy and quickly, I was thankful for that. After 3 days I tried again and got one eye beautifully applied on the first try! I moved onto the second, which didn't come out AS beautiful, but still not bad. However by this point the glue and sealant that was seeping into my eyeballs burned so bad I could barely stand it. Be careful how much you use because even a tiny bit coming off the lashes and in your eyes is trouble. The more my eyes watered the more loose and unstable the lashes felt for me. They lasted all day and into the evening. I made pasta for dinner and the steam from the pot did me in. They had to come off, I couldn't stand the feeling that they were half attached. I took this as an opportunity to practice thinking maybe I didn't adhere them well enough since I was so afraid off too much glue and burning me eyes. I reapplied them the next morning, which now only took me about 30 minutes, and they looked OK but not nearly as clean and cute as my friends who go to a tech for this type of thing. I slept in them overnight and lost one cluster of lashes to my pillow but the rest stayed in place. I cannot attest to the fact that these can be worn for two weeks because after one night my eyes were so done with me they sent me a certified letter stating to knock this eyelash thing off immediately-\n\nI wanted to love these but they're not for me. They're packaged beautifully, the lashes themselves aren't bad, but they're adhesive and the application process is a learning curve I haven't figured out how to overcome yet. When I'm brave and confident enough, I'll probably still try again, so they're not totally bad. Give them a try but be prepared!",
