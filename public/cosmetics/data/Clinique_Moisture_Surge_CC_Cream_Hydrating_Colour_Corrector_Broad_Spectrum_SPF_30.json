I felt that my skin looked too shiny around my t-zone (glowy), so I added concealer under my eyes and on both sides of my nose, and it was perfectly long lasting and the right tones. I'm using this for coverage during the week where I want light, natural looking face and not too heavy on the makeup. I found no excessive oiliness during the day and it had very good staying ability. Would recommend for anyone with oily or combo/oily skin.",

(In brands with a wide range of shades I am usually the second lightest on the spectrum). This is my first CC cream and I was a little hesitant to get a \"moisture surge\" product this time of year as they are usually too heavy for me . However, this did not go on like moisturizer at all; it was rather thick and hard to blend. I used a blending sponge like I would for a medium/ full coverage foundation (which I never wear).\n\nIt looks good in the bathroom mirror a few feet away, but close up I can see every single pore of my face highlighted -- my nose was the worst, but everywhere it looked like tiny dots. Maybe it's the zinc oxide? So I haven't even had the nerve to wear it out; who knows what it would look like in sunlight/office lights. I have been using retinoids, so that may be why this doesn't \"take\" to my skin, but unfortunately it didn't work for me. I will try it again in the height of summer and see how it goes, but I suspect it will just make me break out.",
