I have not seen any improvement yet for myself with redness, but I will say that it has not made it worse, which is a good sign. My skin doesn't feel tight after washing, but it feels clean. no residue-y feel afterwards which is better than the Estee Lauder wash I've been using. so, comparatively, it's a cheaper product with a better result than what I've been using. Hopefully, it will continue to work well. I would like to see it help with the redness, but I think I will need to use longer to see improvement in thar department. But, so far, I'm impressed.",

So, so gentle on my sensitive, oily/combo skin. Cleanses nicely without stripping your skin... I'm now able to use my salicylic acid toner for blackheads without it overly drying my skin. Pairs nicely with an exfoliating pad or on its own. Seriously, I will be repurchasing and need a jumbo size. After about a week my skin is so glowy. Love it!",

That is until this cleanser came into my life, I saw a dermatologist on the clock app talking about how it's wonderful for hormonal acne and she was correct. My skin is smooth, soft, and if I do happen to get acne they don't come to a head and not painful whatsoever. I'm going to recommend this to everyone dealing with bad acne.",

When this bottle with last 3 to 4 times as long for cheaper, you just have to shell out more at the beginning. \n\nThat being said I LOVE THIS! I got a trial size  (.1 oz) it lasted 7 days and used it twice a day and it cleared my chin within the first two uses. I was amazed. It doesn't dry out my skin that I can tell, but I also use philosophy ultimate day cream and night cream right afterwards to give my face moisture. If it does dry out I definitely recommend using a spf day cream especially during winter months anyways.",
