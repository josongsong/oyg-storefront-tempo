So it will last you longer than the usual face gel cleaner. It leaves my skin feeling super clean and soft and has a nice light scent too. I would definitely recommed purchasing it if you are on thr fence like i was, it was worth it!",

Just after my first use I saw such a brightening difference. I first cleanse with the Hanskin pore cleansing oil then second cleanse with this and it has saved my skin. I had very textured and dull skin and now I don't even need foundation most days because I'm that confident in my skin. It's a soft exfoliant that really does that job, leaving my skin smooth and glowing all on its own. I finish with ROC vitamin C gel and I'm out the door. This is a must buy for any person with textured skin !",

You just wet your hands, put about a quarter sized amount in your palm then use your other hand to begin lathering. Even if I happen to have a few pieces not already dissolved, when I begin lathering on my wet face the wash does not feel abrasive at all. It's also really nice because my face feels clean and hydrated unlike that harsh, stripped feeling I usually get. Like I've been using this and honestly my face feels/looks like I actually drink a lot of water. I'm really happy giving this product a try since I couldn't even find reviews for this online and it's such a good 2nd step cleanser. So long as Ulta doesn't run out, I'm going to keep on buying this! Also as a note, these types of cleansers last a long time so even with the nearly $30 price point, it's still a bargain considering this will last me at least 4-6 months and I wash my face 2x a day.",

        "comments": "I have mixed feelings over this product and I'll elaborate some more. I have combination and acne-prone skin and was looking forward to using this product. The product was travel friendly and the idea was good, but my skin did not agree with it. I liked that when you added warm water, it foamed really nicely, but I did not like the smell. It was almost like plastic and chemicals which was definitely not the best sensorial experience. After a week or two of use, I noticed that my skin became really irritated and red (itchy). It felt like I had a large reaction that dwindled down after some time passed. Normally, my skin does not behave like this, so I decided to remove this product from my routine and the redness was gone. I identified this product of being the root of the cause and think that I might have a Vitamin C reaction in general. If you are looking to buy this product, look into it some more and make sure you don't have reactions to Vitamin C. Note that this product is definitely not a product that you should be dependent on for receiving Vitamin C because you would not receive a lot of benefits from this. Overall, it was okay, but I personally will not be purchasing again.",
