It definitely cleanses well and removes sunscreen and makeup but don't use it on your eyes! It makes my eyes burn if this gets too close. Kind of bummed that I still have to go in with micellar water to remove eye makeup, but will continue to use since I love the feel of an oil cleansing balm and love that it's in a tube.",
