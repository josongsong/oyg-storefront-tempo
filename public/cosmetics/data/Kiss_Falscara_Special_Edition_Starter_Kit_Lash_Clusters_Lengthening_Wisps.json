A little goes a long way!Step 2: Use the APPLICATOR to pluck a WISP from the tray. As shown, pick up a WISP from the middle-outer end for optimal control. One by one, gently place the WISPS underneath the base of your natural lashes, slightly away from the waterline. Apply wisps starting from the outer corner of lash line, working inwards (or vice versa). Place WISPS right next to each other for a seamless look.Step 3: Dab a thin coat of SEAL under WISPS to eliminate any sticky residue and hold WISPS in place. Pro tips: If needed, after applying SEAL under WISPS, use the APPLICATOR or your fingers to squeeze the WISPS against your natural lashes; this helps the WISPS adhere for a more secure hold.TO REMOVE:• Saturate a cotton pad with FALSCARA REMOVER (sold separately) or oil-free makeup remover.• Place pad over eyes for 10 seconds, then gently wipe or peel off WISPS and BOND & SEAL.TO REUSE WISPS:• Place used WISPS on a paper towel, coat with FALSCARA REMOVER or oil-free makeup remover, then let sit for 10 seconds.• Saturate a cotton swab with remover and gently wipe away BOND & SEAL residue from the WISPS.

        "comments": "I'm not sure if I got a bad batch, but I bought this kit a few months ago and when I went to remove the lashes from the package being very delicate and careful they all fell apart. It didn't matter if I use my fingers lightly or some tweezers or if I picked it up at the base of the lash gently or at the side of it - the actual lashes would just crumble off of the base of the false lash. My entire package is full of disintegrated lashes due to not being able to get them out of the package and now I have an eyelash full of glue and nothing to do with it very disappointing and I wish I could get a refund.",

The glue sucks, they dont even last overnight. The curl falls out of them so easily, and it makes them look droppy and stupid. I've tried so many methods ive seen on tiktok  to make them last. They dont work AT ALL. The only good thing about theese is the tweezers they come with. Don't waste your money on these.",

        "comments": "I am an experienced lash user and I wanted to try something new.  The lashes are very firmly glued into the packaging so it's difficult to even get them out.  The hairs fall out during removal, during application, and during wear.  I don't understand the point of the two step glue when the first step isn't enough to hold the lashes in place and the second step doesn't dry.   So i had shedding and goopy clusters that were not secure.  \nI've used to kiss lashes before and liked them, but this kit was a complete failure",

Not to mentoion the glue and the remover is also terrible. I wish that i read more into the reviews.",

        "comments": "I gave this product a month before I wrote a review. This review is especially for hooded older eyes. I have had eyelash extensions for at least 4 YEARS or more, going every 3 weeks for fills so I have not seen the state of my scant Asian natural lashes for a very long time. So I will break down this product and use after seeing my lack of natural lashes and using strip lashes for about a month to help the regrowth. I figured this would be easier in my daily routine than strip lashes when I saw other reviews that it can last up to10 days.\nPros:\nA lot lighter in weight and feel that both strip lashes and lash extensions\nDoes not affect the growth of natural lashes either in application or removal\nCost is so much cheaper than lash extensions and fills\nTime taken to apply is a lot less than going to get lash extensions\nLooks less \"heavy\" on the lid than strip lashes as I don't wear eyeliner\nLooks more natural than a strip lash\nThere is no pull on the lid to remove like when you have to remove a strip lash\nLasted me 10-14 days so there is no daily application like with strip lashes\nCons:\nTakes me more time to apply than strip lashes (but then again I don't have to do it daily)\nThe bond is sticky and can stick to upper skin and the seal leaves a white residue on the lashes\nThe lashes in this kit broke apart when trying to remove it from the package. Others complained about it so I was ultra careful and lost almost 40% of the lash clusters before I decided to take the lash remover that the kit came with and a qtip, gently rubbed the band of the cluster and it came off easily. The multi pack with extra lashes only (sold separately) does not have this issue.\nApplication for hooded mature eyes:\nClean eyelashes thoroughly. I used a gentle toner on a cotton pad\nCurl lashes\nApply bond sparingly like mascara one section at a time\nWait for it to get tacky. Meanwhile you can take the eyelash tool provided and swipe the seal on it so the lash does not stick to it\nPick up a lash cluster and apply. Use a mirror angled under your chin for best results\nFor the bond not to stick to my hooded eyelid I use a qtip soaked in remover pressed against the crease of my eyelid. This also helps put the underside of the lashes more exposed for application.\nImmediately clamp the lash and natural lashes together tightly. Wipe the tool from any bond and continue the process.\nThe entire process for both eyes takes me 15 mins.\nThe day after, apply the overnighter on the base of the eyelashes. I believe this is what made my lashes last for 10-14 days\nRemoval:\nTake a qtip soaked in remover and gently brush it on lashes with eyes closed. Lashes come off quite easily. You can take the bond off the lashes the same way and complete the process with a pad soaked in toner.\nThe product lost one star because 50% of the lashes were destroyed in removal. Also because the seal leaves a white residue on the lashes.\nNotes: a cluster has come loose now and then (especially after sleep) and it takes less than a minute to reapply bond and reattach\n\nOverall I am very happy with the product as it is easy enough in application although there is a little learning curve as with any lash product. It is definitely a great alternative cost and time wise to getting lash extensions. Also the regrowth of my natural lashes has been a big plus.",

        "comments": "The Kiss Falscara Starter Kit is a great beginner-friendly kit that comes with everything you need to get started, making the whole process feel a little less intimidating. \n\nThe instructions were very clear and simple - just swipe on the bond, place the lashes, then swipe on the seal - making it easy to manage. That being said, I had more issues than success. \n\nThe lashes themselves were great. They're soft and don't feel heavy, but after the 4th or 5th attempt, I had mixed feelings about the bond itself. The bond has a tacky texture that made my natural lashes clump together, leaving the final look nonuniform and less natural than I hoped for. Instead of a seamless lash line, it looked a bit messy and uneven in parts. \n\nThe application tweezer also gave me some trouble. It felt slippery and kept shifting the angle of the lashes I was trying to apply. I found myself squeezing extra hard just to make sure I was holding the lashes well, but I was also scared I would crease them too much. The tweezer was also a bit chunky and got in the way, making it difficult to calculate where I was placing the lashes. In the end, it was easier for me to use my fingers to apply the lashes more precisely. \n\nRemoving the lashes was fairly simple when using the removal oil included in the kit. I dabbed a bit of the oil on one finger, rubbed my fingers together, then held the lashes gently between them for a few seconds before they slid right off. \n\nCleaning the lashes was basically the same process. I used a small amount of remover and rubbed it along the lashes to get rid of any leftover bond or seal. Just be sure to clean them right after removing them. If you wait too long, the residue gunks up and the lashes can become clumpy, which can cause eye irritation or infection if you try using them again.\n\nOverall, the kit is great if you're new to lashes, but you might want to explore other application tools or bonding formulas for better results. I will continue to try and hope that one of these days, I get it right....",
