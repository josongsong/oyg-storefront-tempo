This balm stands out for its gentle yet effective formula, designed to soothe and cleanse without irritation.\n\nThe buttery texture melts into the skin, transforming into a silky oil that easily breaks down stubborn makeup and sunscreen. Infused with soothing ingredients like Centella Asiatica extract and licorice root, it calms redness and irritation, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Plus, it's free from harsh chemicals, ensuring a gentle cleanse without stripping natural oils.\n\nAfter rinsing, my skin feels soft, clean, and hydrated, with no greasy residue. Over time, I've noticed a reduction in redness and sensitivity. The Clean It Zero Calming Cleansing Balm is an outstanding choice for anyone seeking a gentle yet effective cleanser.",

I didn't realize it because the packaging barely changed, but the new one smells like Vicks Vaporub and made my skin and eyes burn. When I went digging, I found one reddit thread mentioning it, and apparently they've added eucalyptus oil and changed up some of the other ingredients. The entire reason I, and many others from what I've read, used the Purifying version is because I have sensitive skin and don't use scented products if I can help it, so I'm not sure why they decided to go that route.\n\nI don't know if the other versions have been reformulated (I believe at least some have), so check your ingredients/packaging. Really wish the company had been more straightforward about changing things up so I didn't waste money on something I can't use. If they bring back the old Purifying formula, it'd be a 5 star review.",
