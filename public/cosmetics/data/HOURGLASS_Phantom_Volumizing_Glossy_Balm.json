The shade that I received is Trace which is a really pretty brownish color. The packaging is stunning as always. Phantom Glossy balm is a nourishing and hydrating lip balm that also plumps adding volume to your lips. I have super dry lips, and this bomb glides right onto my lips so beautifully! Leaving them hydrated, Northwest, shiny and plump, without any tingling. Trace is a beautiful brown color that looks really natural on my lips and has a gorgeous shine! My lips look shiny, dewy and just overall stunning. I definitely need more of the shades now!",

        "comments": "Gifted by Hourglass The Phantom Glossy Balm Refresh is formulated to hydrate, plump and deliver glossy shine. I love everything about this glossy balm except the tube. The formula is exactly what I want in a lip product. First, here's what I love. The glossy balm texture feels so creamy and soft. It leaves my lips feeling hydrated, smooth and soft. The color, Slip, is beautiful. It looks natural and somewhat sheer but completely buildable with additional layers. The color itself is very flattering by building on your natural lip color. What I don't love is the non-retractable tube. You have to be very careful when you twist the base to dispense the product. It does not retract. This doesn't make sense at all. You will always need to twist a little more than the metal tube so you can apply it , but what do you do when you finish applying if you can't retract it back? I made the mistake of twisting out too much, more that can fit below the cap. My husband thought he could fix this but instead he twisted out even more! So now, I leave my balm out without the cap, hoping the tube doesn't tip over. I think a better way to package this would be in a retractable tube or in a lip container with a lip brush. Without this issue, I'd give it a 5/5 for the color and formula but unfortunately, almost all lip products are retractable these days so if you don't realize this one does not retract, you will waste your purchase.",
