The consistency of the lippie is on the thinner side, so a little goes along way.\n\nI feel like you need to wear somesort of lip liner to prevent bleeding into the textures around the mouth. It takes a minute for it to dry once applied. It is NOT TRANSFER PROOF!! With that said, you kinda need to experiment with how this formula lays on your skin texture. You may need a liner, extra concealor for cleanup, prime the mouth area with something else...the list goes on. \n\nIf you are a beginner for liquid lipstick, this isn't the one you'd want. Its too finicky and the price point isn't worth it. If you are a pro and up for some experimenting, go right ahead. Personally, I wouldn't spend so much on something thats not inclusive to all skin types.",

For anyone wondering about undertones, it has a magenta almost light purple undertone to it, and i prefer orange or yellow undertones on myself. This would look great on anyone with cool undertones i feel, i have neutral undertones and it is too berry toned on my lips for what i want. I do like the thinness of the lipstick itself, but a little goes a LONG way, and the applicator is easy for me, who is also disabled and has a hard time with my hands.",

Not pretty.\n\nIf you set it with a translucent powder after application, it stays a bit better.\n\nIf youre planning on eating or kissing, babe don't wear this one.\n\nBjt if youre planning on serving up some iconic looks - slap it on your lips!!!",

I have not had to reapply. It lasts quite a while. \n\nI can't kiss my daughter without leaving a kiss print on her though. And while eating it smeared on my chin some so I had to clean that up. \n\nAll around I think its a nice lip paint and I always recommend it.",

It lasts very well for me. I find I can even top it with a gloss without ruining the long wear, as long as I let it dry fully before doing so. The gloss wears of but the Stunna Lip Paint stays put! The reason I gave it four stars is that I think the applicator could be better. The applicator is great for applying product to the fleshy part of the lip, but it's difficult to apply product precisely around the edges of your lips with it. I feel that a product of this type needs to be applied precisely along the lip edges to get the best effect. I've tried a lip liner, but that shortens the wear of the product, which kind of defeats the purpose of a long wear product of this type. I use a brush to apply around my lip line, and then use the applicator to apply to my lips. That works well, but it would be nice if the applicator provided could accomplish this. I must say though, the packaging is beautiful - as is all of the Fenty Beauty packaging. Of course I'd expect nothing less from Rihanna!  The only other thing I'd say is that I'd love to see more color choices in this wonderful product. I'm so glad Ulta is carrying this line now, as I prefer Ulta to any other beauty retailer. Their customer service and rewards program are the best, IMHO. Fenty Beauty and Ulta are a win-win for me!",

        "comments": "I fell in love with the high pigmentation and the shape of the applicator. The consistency of the lippie is on the thinner side, so a little goes along way.\n\nI feel like you need to wear somesort of lip liner to prevent bleeding into the textures around the mouth. It takes a minute for it to dry once applied. It is NOT TRANSFER PROOF!! With that said, you kinda need to experiment with how this formula lays on your skin texture. You may need a liner, extra concealor for cleanup, prime the mouth area with something else...the list goes on. \n\nIf you are a beginner for liquid lipstick, this isn't the one you'd want. Its too finicky and the price point isn't worth it. If you are a pro and up for some experimenting, go right ahead. Personally, I wouldn't spend so much on something thats not inclusive to all skin types.",
