I have them in different purses, my gym bag, at school, in my car etc. But as the pallets get empty, I'm not buying any more because they no longer have a brush included which made them so great for on-the-go. There are other larger bronzers that I prefer to use daily instead if I have to pack a brush and mirror anyway. Why can't they make the packaging big enough to put the brush in there and sell it seperatly?!? So dumb.",

Just a light sweep does the trip to make me look sunkissed and \"alive\" in the winter and never looks fake. In the summer, it's the perfect compliment to my tan. Recently, however, I LOVE using it as an eyeshadow. Whether alone, with eyeliner, or with another color shadow over--this bronzer sets my lids to the perfect natural bronzed shade, or works well to prep and put something else over. LOVE!",

After about 8 months, I started to notice it was too orange for my liking. On my light, olive/yellow asian skin tone, it just pulled too warm and yellow undertoned on me. I look back at old pictures and notice it as well. Now it's been over 2 years and I don't love it anymore and I'd never repurchase it again. It's a really nice formula but the shade just does not work on me",
