My only con was that its not full coverage.",

This concealer applies evenly, looks very natural while still offering good coverage, is very brightening, doesn't crease, and lasts all day. It genuinely boosts my confidence when I wear it. \n\nI love this product and would HIGHLY recommend.",

A little but blended with a brush goes a long way you dont even need much of it. Love how inclusive Juvias Place is considering a lot of brands still lack that even in 2025… but anyways the ONLY con i will say is that if you have a lot of natural creasing in your undereye, just be cautious. Applying a little is best as the first time i used it i put a lot to get a full coverage look but it creased pretty bad. I since then apply a light amount and it works great. Would recommend!",

        "comments": "I unfortunately had severe reactions to these concealers and the matching foundations I got from this range.\nI made sure to check how my skin reacted to just concealer alone, foundation alone, and both on my skin together.\nI wanted to love this, I swear by this brand's lip products. But I have been suffering with burning pimply allergic reactions to this product that sensitized me to other skincare products that suited my skin just fine before I tried out the foundation and the concealers in this range. \nI have to throw this and the foundation out. I don't even want to know what would happen if I return to ever using it again because it caused my eyelids and the surrounding skin to burn and swell up, all over my face I went red and every inch was inflamed, even skin flaking and peeling. I haven't had this happen in YEARS since I've been meticulous about my skincare and sunscreen. So unfortunately I won't be touching anything but the lip products I already have by this brand again. absolutely disappointing, and I'm pretty lucky I am seeing gradual improvement in my skin, but I'm still seeing a doctor to verify my skin is healing properly after weeks of not using the foundation and concealer has still left my skin so delicate and stings a bit when I put on my most soothing products like snail mucin essence, cicaplast baume and rosewater.\nAs a separate note excluding the reactions, the concealer texture is decent, a bit on the less coverage side in my opinion especially when the foundation for this range  is so thick and full coverage. Shade range of the concealers cater to neutral olive tone skin much better than the foundation. \nBut I can't even use these despite the shade match because something very bad is in these products I got from the Juvia's Place website directly.",
