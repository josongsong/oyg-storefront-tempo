Not only is the burgundy a most beautiful color that brings out the blue in my eyes, you'd never know it was burgundy. (I had some concerns before using.)  There is ZERO clumping and it truly does lengthen beyond my wildest dreams.  It does not smudge or rub off yet washes off beautifully at the end of the day. Always swore I'd never use \"colored\" mascara until this beauty.  Highly recommend!!!",

I purchased the burgundy shade - I have pretty decent natural lashes, and they're blonde, so colored mascaras usually show up really well for me. This one did not; I also didnt feel like it gave me any volume, curl, or lengthening. Maybelline usually nails it for budget mascara, but this one was a bust. I found that more than 2 coats it got got clumpy, and still wasnt pigmented enough.",

        "comments": "I was looking to try out a burgundy mascara and came across this one. Not having super high hopes, I gave it a shot to prove the concept. now she is my daily go to 🥰\n\nThe burgundy color is not super noticeable to me but I believe it does make a difference (I have hazel eyes and I wanted to enhance the green) and a couple of artsy friends commented when asked that they could tell it was burgundy on my already black lashes.\n\nWhere this mascara really shines is 1. the wand and 2. the formula. Love love love.\n\nI definitely have to scrape excess product off the tip of the wand, but after that application is super easy and consistent, the brush is flexible but easy to control if you don't press too hard. the longer bristles help pick up every little lash and the narrow tip gets in the corners. \n\na minor con is that it's hard to drag through lashes for a second coat once the first coat has dried, so don't let it dry fully before going in for coat #2. you may risk clumping otherwise.\n\nonce it dries this formula is super comfortable and does not budge. I have oily skin and it challenges most products I put near my eyes but this stands up.\n\nanother minor con is that it takes some effort to remove, but a little micellar water or warm water soak does the trick. it feels like a tubing mascara because it comes off in clumps and strips instead of just dissolving away.\n\nI had a rough week and this didn't smear or flake even after crying. 11/10 already adding this back to my cart so I can repurchase.",

Anyways— I like it! I'll purchase again with my own money because I love how it spreads each lash and gives it a natural, yet emphasized look. My natural lashes aren't super long, but they're not super short either so I always look for length, volume and longevity. In the photo I took, I only used one coat, and it gave me lift, my lashes don't look like spider legs or clumpy (yay). Another thing I really enjoy is after hours of wear IT DIDN'T FLAKE OR RUN down into the corners of my eye or bottom lash line (ya know how you blink and you're like how did that mascara get there?! Yeah that didn't happen with this mascara! This performs well and I highly recommend it. The packaging is so nice too, very luxe feeling. W",
