So I tried using both products at the same time. I would us the medicated cleanser on the areas needed and the gentle cleanser everywhere else and it worked like a charm! Now I just use the hydrating cleanser as my skin has cleared up. LOVE this product.",

Im sure that a bottle like this will last me over a year, since i only use one pump per use. Its also nice and hydrating as marketed, not leaving my skin feel tight and stripped, where i have to stretch my face to get rid of that feeling. Its very nice and gentle as well!\n\nSome things i didnt expect or really care for was the lack of foaming, which at first made me question if it worked or not, and the slight warmth it brought around my nose and upper lip. Though, no reaction happened, which works for me!\n\nOverall, its good! Trust me, even though it doesnt foam, it works, and it does the job.",

I was very impressed with the ingredients; it is difficult to find a gentle milk cleanser that is truly acne safe! Or really any cleanser for that matter. I have just finished a protocol with Roccoco Botanicals to heal my skin barrier and was looking for something to maintain my clear skin and continue to cleanse effectively without stripping the barrier I had just built back up. The value for money here is incredible, I thought at first it was just too good! I decided to buy it and I am so grateful I did. I do not use any foaming cleansers because I have inflammatory acne prone skin post childbirth. My skin is rather normal with oil control and can tend to be on the dry side at times. This cleanser isn't the most hydrating, but it rinses off like a gel and leaves no residue on my skin. It is a white milky-gel with about a medium viscosity. It is just right really and spreads on the skin really well, damp or dry. I wouldn't recommend for makeup removal, this is a skin cleanser not a remover! I use Bioderma Sensibo H2O to remove makeup and go in with this on dry skin, then add a few drops of water on my fingers after working it in about 30 seconds dry. I use in the morning also and apply it on my dry skin and leave it as a mask for a few minutes in effort to benefit form the niacinamide and ceramides in it, then rinse. It leaves my skin soft but also feeling cleansed, without any squeakyness, dry tightness, or dullness often accompanied by cleansers. I have noticed that this helps maintains my skin barrier well since my skin isn't red or pink after cleansing. I would absolutely recommend this for every skin, especially acne prone since there are no real clogging ingredients in this apart from the Tocopherol which is not only last on the list, but is getting rinsed off. Prefer this over my Glossier Milky Jelly!",

I'm not sure which ingredient in the bottle is causing the burning sensation, so I would only recommend it to those who know for sure that none of the ingredients on the label will irritate them, because it really did a great job of cleansing my skin and making it feel comfortable after drying. I just can't get past the burning feeling during washing every single time.",
