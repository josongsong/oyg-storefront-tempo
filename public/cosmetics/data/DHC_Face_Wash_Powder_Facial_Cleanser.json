It has a really nice lather to it and leaves your skin feeling very clean. I am definitely making this my travel face wash for when im flying and need to limit liquids. However, it isnt one that i want to use regularly at home only because it has that \"rubbery\" skin feeling after you use it like certain soaps do and that is personally a big pet peeve of mine. Also it didnt dry my skin out entirely, but i didnt feel like it hydrated it quite enough. 3.5/5, for me its only alright but i can see how some people moght love it.\n\n33, acne prone combination skin.",

As soon as i rinsed this off my face felt sooo soft and hyrdated. it brightened my skin and my face had that natural glow from within look and appearance wise so much more brighter and radiant!! I was so shocked tbh. this is amazing if you have sensitive skin aswell. The past couple days ive been using this its faded my blemishs and these tiny dots on my face ive been struggling to get rid of! it takes a couple times to fully learn how to properly use but one you do its amazing. Since i have super oily skin my skin usually hates hyrdating and super creamy cleansers but this is literally the only exception lmaoo. i would totally recommend trying this. price is also really fair!",

        "comments": "I have been looking for a facial exfoliation wash similar to Tatcha's or Dermatologica's but at a better price point. I was excited to discover DHC on Ulta's website and instantly fell in love with them! Cost is great, the packaging is nice and minimalist in feel, they have a good range of J-beauty cornerstone products, they're made in Japan, and are often used in luxury spas and hotels in Japan. Product-wise, this powder wash combines with water to make a foamy, fluffy face wash that's great on sensitive skin. I thought it was an exfoliant wash at the time of purchase but there isn't much in the way of remaining granules once you wet the product to exfoliate with. The reason I won't be repurchasing is because this brand was initially listed under Ulta's cruelty-free brands and has since been removed. Upon further research, DHC does not test on animals but they do outsource animal testing to other companies to sell in countries where animal testing is required by law. I might consider repurchasing if not for the animal testing component and wish DHC would stop distributing in counties requiring animal testing.",

Wet the net, add a little wash powder to the net, work up lots of foamy lather, and collect the lather in your hands to wash your face. Not necessary I guess, but I'm easily entertained and it lets me use less powder. \n\nIn your double cleanse routine this goes after your cleansing oil/balm step: I can't use DHC cleansing oil without it. Keep in mind, you will need to remove waterproof cosmetics separately. Still, I will ALWAYS have this wash powder on hand in my bathroom and travel bag.",

I have very oily skin and the old  formula was a great cleanser. The new formula is OK but doesn't clean my skin nearly as well. I guess if your skin isn't oily it works ok. I hate it when I find something that works and they change the formula. I've been using the blue bottle but only because I bought a bunch of it but I'm searching again for a good cleanser for my oily skin.",
