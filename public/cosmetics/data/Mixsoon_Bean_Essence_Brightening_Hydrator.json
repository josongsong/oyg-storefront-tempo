Its lightweight and slightly sticky texture absorbs well, leaving my skin feeling hydrated without any irritation or breakouts. Over time, I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's texture. The dryness and flakiness I usually experience during winter have diminished, giving way to smoother and more radiant skin. The added vitamins in the formula seem to aid in fading acne scars, contributing to a more even complexion.Overall, Mixsoon Bean Essence has become a staple in my skincare routine, providing hydration and gentle exfoliation without compromising my skin's sensitivity.",

        "comments": "Ok so this is My first time ordering snail anything , and yes I got hooked on the hype (LOL) so I'll be giving updates on the difference on my skin ( I love taking care of me first before cosmetics) I use it for the first time last night and directions says wait till absorbed, my main issue with my routine if the time it takes to absorb before I start on my next regime, got example I start with an essence where I wait two minutes Before applying applying anything else, and it does absorb quickly I must say, so far as far as the shipping was fast and the actual product was good, my only problem is; the amount of product in the bottle. I DO wish I could submit pictures but for some reason I can't, but any ways, the product in the bottle size is not accurate and I do feel cheated and would possibly either like a refund or will not be purchasing from this company again. I mean snail mucin is a very in product in this era, so it'll be best not to cheat your customers of what they buy!",
