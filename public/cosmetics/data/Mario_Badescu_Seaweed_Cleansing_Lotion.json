It's not an absolute miracle for all my skin problems but it helps a lot ! I use this in the morning instead of washing my whole face and then continue with the rest of my skin care. It doesn't dry out your face (combination skin over here) and it doesn't make it oily. It leaves you fresh and feeling clean. Would definitely recommend giving it a try !",

I have combination skin, and occasionally have small breakouts on my jawline. After several uses, I noticed a huge difference! This product really works! It helps minimizes the small breakouts I get, clears the oils from around my nose and shrunk my problematic pores. And the price for the size of the product, is a steal!\nAll positive comments aside, the smell, is awful. It smells like an old ladies perfume. It does linger, but luckily not for too long.  Even though the smell isn't my cup of tea, I will continue to use this product because it works so well.",

        "comments": "This is the one skincare product I simply can't live without. I have been using it for years and it blows every other toner out of the water hands down–even the ones that cost as much as 3 times the price. I have combination-oily skin that is prone to breakouts as well as extremely sensitive. I also shave my face every single morning, which can do a lot of harm and create redness, welts, and abrasions. This product takes care of all of that. It soothes and relieves my skin and visibly decreases the redness. It clears up my pores and strips dirt from my skin. It leaves me feeling fresh every time. I never leave home without it. I use it in the AM after a morning cleanser–applying evenly to the face and wiping off with a cotton pad (wipe strategically and away from the face to prevent dirt buildups) and follow it with a mattifying SPF moisturizer. I LOVE this brand and I LOVE this product. \n\nIf you are someone who shaves your face, or someone with sensitive and acne-prone skin, I can't recommend this product highly enough.",

I know the name can be a bit deceiving. \nWhen trying out this product, I have to say I did break out a bit, especially on my forehead. My skin was not used to this product in the beginning and I should have tested it out in a small area before committing to use it all over my face. I waited a few weeks before trying it out again and it actually paired with my skin very well! A little goes a long way for me and I did notice the extra dirt and make-up residue my cotton ball grabs when sweeping off the toner across my face. My face feels refreshed after use!

Other acne products dry my skin out completely to the point of flaking and cracking. This does not. Usually, products meant to keep moisture in your skin end up giving me clogged pores and horrible breakouts. This does not. It is non-drying and non-pore clogging. I love it. I notice it doesn't exactly FIGHT acne but it doesn't CAUSE it like other products. And it doesn't dry my skin out. I use this with the MB seaweed night cream AND MY SKIN IS SO NICE. My skin is not dry at all, and not full of product-induced acne. I do however get hormonal acne and this DOES NOT MAKE IT WORSE like many other products. Keeps it under control. I recommend this to anybody with dry acne prone skin",
