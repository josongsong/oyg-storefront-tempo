I've been using the too faced lip injection extreme for years, and then once they introduced the maximum plump version I switched over to that. I wear that plumping product everyday before starting my makeup so my lips look nice and full when I get to my lip color. Recently (like the last month) I've also been wearing the too faced product as a gloss everyday on top of lipstick. Needless to say I'm so very used to a burning stinging sensation. Most lip plump products don't even come close to the sensation the too faced one gives. The only thing I've found that's really similar is the new Milani MAXXX lip balm. It burns like the too faced one. So trying this out after reading reviews I was expecting it to be very intense. Maybe I'm just used to a sting but this was very mild and just tingly (slightly hot) but nothing crazy. I will say I love how this smoothed out my lip lines and makes my lips look super smooth and juicy from the glossy shine. It also made them look very pillowy and well, plump. No complaints there. Also the color fenty glow is the perfect everyday Nude shade. No shimmer, just a perfect shine. This is a great everyday product if you can handle the slightly hot tingly feeling. It does give great results. I may just be so \"numb\" to the tingling feeling that I don't feel it as much as others. Give it a try",

The first time I applied, it burned my lips like crazy. Anyone remember Maybelline Volume XL Seduction Lip Plumper ages ago? It kind of like that. Don't get me wrong, it's the perfect brown shade for medium to darker skin tone, especially if you have dark pigmented lips. It didn't plump my lips but the gloss is amazing. I don't know why some people have mention there's a smell when I don't smell anything terrible. I definitely will purchase this for the glossy look in the future.",
