It wasn't one simple swoop from root to tip. I had to really dig the brush into my eyelash line. It was a struggle, too much IMO. I did the same thing to the upper and lower lash. Took too long. Second, took double the time and spider eyes. Third, AHS on AMC. I'm going back to Roller Lash and returning this trash.",

So finally, I decided to try this one out when Ulta had a sale on mascaras. I bought several from different brands. Ultimately, this mascara (and one from another brand) stuck out to me the most… I was amazed at the length this mascara brought to my lashes. And it gives your lashes a good curl too. All these results with 1 coat !! So you really dont need to use a lot of product, or you can risk your lashes looking \"spider-y.\"\nIt doesnt give you that dramatic, bold, intense eye look but more so the cheeky, cute, flirty everyday look. \nSo this mascara has officially entered into my rotation for now as my everyday, daytime mascara and the other brand (Anastasia) as my nighttime mascara. \nDefinitely try this product out and you'll be amazed!!",
