Only thing I will say is there isn't a \"plumping\" affect which isn't why I personally bought it for in the first place, but if that's something your looking for, your not going to get that with this. Nonetheless it's perfect! (please come out with a fair cool toned pink lip liner!!!)",

However it has a nice vanilla scent to it which is something that I would least care about.\n\nLongevity would be my first concern especially when it comes to lip liners; waterproof feature would be second.\n\nObviously colors, pigment and texture are important too - this one has a good amount of pigment, but the fact that the texture is so creamy would cancel the long-lasting effect, in my opinion. I could easily rub it off with my fingers without putting too much effort. Also because the texture is so creamy it glides nicely, but it does not apply a solid even streak.\n\nI would definitely not purchase this for my professional kit or my personal.",
