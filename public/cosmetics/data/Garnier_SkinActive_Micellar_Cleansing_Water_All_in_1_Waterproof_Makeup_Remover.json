It doesn't bother my skin and I have EXTREMELY dry and sensitive skin. It is amazing and I love both of the formulas.

        "comments": "I am Korean, so I have very straight Asian lashes that fall down with normal mascaras. I have to exclusively use Asian mascaras because nothing else will be smudge-proof and hold up my lashes all day. However, those are a PAIN to take off :( \n\nBUT this makeup remover (specifically the blue cap) is the only thing that can take everything off. You can't just start swiping your cotton pad immediately upon contact though - you have to hold the pad onto your stubborn makeup and let it marinate for like at least 15 seconds (I hold it on for like 20-30 for my mascara) before swiping. Let it do its magic, and it'll come off in a breeze. \n\nNot only do I wear super robust mascara, I also do a whole beat on my face with waterproof eyeliner and a thick full coverage foundation. This makeup remover makes taking off my thick base layer (that got solidified with powder) a breeze. I can usually get away with using 3 cotton pads to remove my whole face and removing leftover residue that doesn't get away from the first pass. It's way easier to remove makeup with this than other makeup remover wipes - the wipes usually irritate my skin by the time I'm done and also require a lot of friction while rubbing. Sometimes I will oil cleanse, but it definitely takes longer to oil cleanse than to use this haha \n\nAnyways, if Garnier ever discontinues this, idk what I'll do lol. I love this product MWAH",

I'm a pretty loyal Garnier customer, so when they came out with this product, I was 1st in line to try it. I've been using it since it's inception. It leaves your skin so clean without drying you out - the first time I used it, I went back over it with an astringent to see what might've been missed (like all of my other cleansers) & there wasn't a single residual amount of make-up or dirt to be found. I've been using it ever since. I use the waterproof one since my eyeliners are usually waterproof. Having had some experience in the make-up field, one bit of advice (a complaint I've seen throughout the comments) - whenever you remove your eye makeup - if the pad you are using is loaded with all the debris from your face, get a fresh one. Then, after you've saturated the pad, gently hold it on your eyelid (and lashes if you're wearing mascara) for about 10-15 seconds). This allows the cleanser to break down the compound holding those long-lasting eyeliners & mascaras in place. Then, gently wipe away. If you used eyeliner &/or mascara on your lower lash-line, use your pinky under the make-up remover pad to gently wipe under that area. You don't want to rub harshly because the skin around your eyes is the thinnest & therefore ages the fastest. This Micellar Water Works! I don't typically leave reviews, but I've had sensitive skin my entire life & I've finally found something that cleans ALL of my make-up OFF, leaving nothing behind AND, without drying my skin out. I'd hate to see anyone turn away from this product because they didn't have a bit more knowledge about how to use it. It really does work.  I wish you all the very best in your skin-care journeys & I pray that this product is never removed from the shelf. It has been my saving grace! Thank you Garnier for another great product!!

They constantly burned, watered, and felt like they were sliced and diced.  This cleanser she had used gave her a severe allergic reaction.  She couldn't even drive to and from work.  I drove her.  She was very light sensitive.  Thank goodness her work accommodated her.  \n\nDo not buy.  In fact, do your research bc there are other reviews from micellar cleansers that state they had the same reaction.  This is a common reaction to this product.",
