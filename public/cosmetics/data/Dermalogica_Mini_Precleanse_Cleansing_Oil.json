I find using this first to help lift off any mascara, lip stain, or oil based product and then I use my face wash to rinse off.  it's amazing how easy this takes off makeup without having to scrub or go over multiple times.  it saves on using less of my normal face wash and I just tried it as a first step in cleaning my makeup brushes and especially with my foundation brushes I was shocked at how it removed the product.  this product does everything it claims and is worth spending extra on.  don't pass up if on sale",

These reasons alone make me cringe at the thought of oil cleanser.\nI honestly bought this knowing that I could (and probably would) return it. The \"thought\" made me think it wouldn't work out for my skin. BOY WAS I WRONG!\nThe first time I used it, it was a little odd to rub oil into your skin (dry hands and dry skin)... but the massage felt great, and the scent is pleasant. I rubbed it all over my eyes, and it never stung. When I added water it became milky and I could literally see makeup dripping off my face (I made a huge mess of my bathroom counter!). I rinsed it off with warm water. My face immediately felt soft, and SO clean! I know that it cleaned my makeup off amazingly, because after using this, I used the ultra calming cleanser with my clarisonic and my bristles of the clarisonic were CLEAN without a trace of makeup on them)\nI have not had any reactions to this, and I truly feel that my face is cleaner after using my face wash.\nThe bottle is pretty large, and will last a LONG time. I only use about a dime to penny size of product in my palm and it takes off: primer, foundation, powder, blush, mascara, eye liner, and eyeshadows.\nGive it a try!",
