        "comments": "I like the product, overall. This is the first retinol product I've tried. I have rosacea, and started using this product every 2 nights for a few weeks. Then, moved to every other night for a few more weeks, before using  it every night for the last several weeks. I also have dry skin.  So, the oil formula is nice for me.  I have noticed some modest changes in tone and sensitivity since starting this product.  \nI removed a star when I read the answer to a customer-submitted question about the percentage (dose or strength) of retinol in the product.  (I was searching for this answer, as well.  I wanted to start researching what I could step up to next, which is normal for retinol use.)The answer provided by Byoma cited that it would be \"giving away secrets\" if they were to disclose this information.  This is untrue.  Many other companies list the strength of the retinol products right on the front of their packaging, and others on the back, or they provide it online.  This is important information to have with retinol use.  (Compare it to a company marketing a sunblock, but refusing to tell you the SPF, as it's a \"secret\".)\nI removed another star when I realized that this is just a ploy to get you to continue to use their product, because even though they market it as \"beginner and sensitive-friendly,\" they don't give you the information you would need (the strength) to be able to make an informed decision about your skin after you've completed a cycle with this product, and are ready to step-up.\nUnfortunately, I use quite a few Byoma products, and they have been great for my skin, but I don't knowingly do business with companies who are not transparent with important information.  I DO have a right to know not only what I am putting on my skin, but in this case, the strength.  I will be finding replacements for all of the Byoma products I use.  This disappoints me.",

This oil is specifically formulated for sensitive skin, and it truly delivers on its promise. From the first use, I noticed how gentle it is. There was no irritation, redness, or peeling, which is rare for a retinol product. The oil has a lightweight texture that absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving a greasy residue. It's deeply hydrating, which is a must for my dry skin, and it leaves my face feeling soft and nourished. After a few weeks of consistent use, I started to see a difference in my skin's texture. It looks smoother, and some fine lines are less noticeable. The best part is that I can enjoy these benefits without worrying about my skin reacting negatively. If you have sensitive skin and have been hesitant to try retinol, I highly recommend giving Byoma Sensitive Retinol Oil a try. It's a gentle yet effective way to incorporate retinol into your skincare routine. Gifted by byoma",

        "comments": "I like the product, overall. This is the first retinol product I've tried. I have rosacea, and started using this product every 2 nights for a few weeks. Then, moved to every other night for a few more weeks, before using  it every night for the last several weeks. I also have dry skin.  So, the oil formula is nice for me.  I have noticed some modest changes in tone and sensitivity since starting this product.  \nI removed a star when I read the answer to a customer-submitted question about the percentage (dose or strength) of retinol in the product.  (I was searching for this answer, as well.  I wanted to start researching what I could step up to next, which is normal for retinol use.)The answer provided by Byoma cited that it would be \"giving away secrets\" if they were to disclose this information.  This is untrue.  Many other companies list the strength of the retinol products right on the front of their packaging, and others on the back, or they provide it online.  This is important information to have with retinol use.  (Compare it to a company marketing a sunblock, but refusing to tell you the SPF, as it's a \"secret\".)\nI removed another star when I realized that this is just a ploy to get you to continue to use their product, because even though they market it as \"beginner and sensitive-friendly,\" they don't give you the information you would need (the strength) to be able to make an informed decision about your skin after you've completed a cycle with this product, and are ready to step-up.\nUnfortunately, I use quite a few Byoma products, and they have been great for my skin, but I don't knowingly do business with companies who are not transparent with important information.  I DO have a right to know not only what I am putting on my skin, but in this case, the strength.  I will be finding replacements for all of the Byoma products I use.  This disappoints me.",
