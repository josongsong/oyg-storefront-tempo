Even though people behind the Clinique counter will always say that this is \"cosmetic grade\" alcohol, it is still alcohol (and not the fatty alcohols which are moisturizing). For the time I used them, I felt the only way to clear my skin was to be agressive....that really didn't help my problems at all and the proof is in using other products from Clinique like their oil cleanser, which is making my skin thrive. I really think the alcohol and witch hazel needs to go and for the Step 2s to be more of an exfoliating essence type of \"lotion\". That way it can still exfoliate with the BHA but provide moisture and really prep skin for serums or the moisturizer. I LOVE Clinique's Even Better Essence and I really believe that a formulation more similar to those would take Clinique's 3 step to the next level. Out with alcohol, in with more of a hydrating but exfoliating essence \"lotion\" please :)",
