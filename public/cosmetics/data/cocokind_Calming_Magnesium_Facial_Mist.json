Be wary of the reviews that are over the top positive about this product because yes, it's a nice fine mist that feels like water on the skin that has some soothing ingredients for calming Inflammation but you don't necessarily need this unless you have rosacea. There are much more affordable mists with larger quantities for less money out there that could potentially change your skin for the better Or heal a damaged barrier but this isn't anything special in my opinion.",
