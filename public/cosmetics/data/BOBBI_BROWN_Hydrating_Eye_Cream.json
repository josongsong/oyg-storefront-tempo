        "comments": "I've tried so many eye creams, and every single time I am disappointed. I've tried squalene, and hyaluronic acid, and serums and brighteners. Each one assuring me that this brand would be the one that would actually deliver. Every morning I would wake up to puffy eyes and red marks, or worse - stinging and sensitivity!  I had stopped looking for under eye cream, because I figured it just wasn't for me. \n\nThen one day I stumbled across Bobbi Brown's under eye cream. Tentatively I tried it out on my good eye - those of us with sensitive skin know. I cautiously tested under the eye that doesn't sting or puff up as badly. I wasn't expecting anything, and I was hoping it would not irritate. The reason I tried it was because they said it would help with the fine under eye lines, and at 55, I so desperately wanted concealer product to not crease up without the theatrics of setting powder that dries your skin. \n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I was shocked there was no puffiness, and I didn't have the redness under my crows feet that I often got in the past. So I tried it the next night, and then I tried it again. Pretty soon I was using it in the morning too. \n\nAfter about a week, I noticed my eyes were smoother and brighter, and had less lines. I had no sensitivity no reactions, and it was an eye cream that actually was working!  That's unbelievable considering for years I have never been able to get anything else to work. \n\nI plan on using this product for the rest of my life. I am 55 years old, and I'm never going to be without it. I'm so glad that this is a staple beauty product. It'll always be on my skin care shelf, and I hope they never discontinue it.  I hope to keep using this product for the rest of my life.\n\nA real Holy Grail product.",

Why? Even after a few applications, my eye area felt very dry and cracked at the corners. Because it was expensive, I tried the product again all last week. The result was the same, especially the painful corners of my eye which was eased only with the use of a competitor's eye cream.\nI will still use BB products, just not this one.",
