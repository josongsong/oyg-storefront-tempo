        "comments": "I received the Murad Cellular Hydration Barrier Cream free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. That's exactly what I'm gonna give you as I'm obsessed.  This is my first time ever trying Murad products, and I'm so thankful I was chosen for this product because I have oily/combination skin and its hard to find products that don't make my face look greasy or feel like I'm weighed down. This cream is super moisturizing & has 24 hr Hydration.  It comes in a beautiful purple glass bottle with the pump on top.  It's easy to hold and use. A little product goes a long way. It's lightweight & absorbs amazing into my skin. My face feels like baby skin. I noticed after my first use I didn't have the dry & flaky patches between my eyes, eyebrows, and the edges of my hair line all the way around my face.  It's crazy that I noticed a difference all the way around from Hydration to my skins bounce. Believe me when I say I have a really hard time finding anything that works with my skin type. I have larger pores and immediately after washing my face I have oily skin severely on the side of my forehead at my temple area. It drives me crazy that I'm always so embarrassed because I can never get rid of it until this past week when I started to use a cleansing oil and this Murad Cellular Hydration Repair Cream. Now that I've had the chance to try a product from Murad, I'm excited to try other products from this brand. This is also good for all skin types which is hard to come by sometimes, especially because if you buy a product that just focuses on one skin type there's a possibility that you can have other areas you want to target and that product may not work. I would ABSOLUTELY 100% recommend this to everyone. I wanted to put in the title what kind of skin I have so that way if someone else has the same type of skin they'll know this will work for you and not make you look/feel oily or heavy. I know alot of times I'm very hesitant about buying new products because alot of people don't get into what type of skin they have and that's the first thing I look for when I'm purchasing a product is the reviews to see what others have experienced with their skin type. So Please don't hesitate or think twice about purchasing this product for all skin types. I promise you will be forever grateful and most likely find your new favorite product/company. Also, if anyone has any recommendations of any other Murad products that they've tried on oily/combination skin and its worked for you please let me know so I can have other products to go with my Cream. One last thing...ENJOY! You and your skin will Thank me & Murad. A++ company.",

I received the cellular Hydration Barrier Repair cream gifted by Murad, I've been so excited about this brand for so long I couldn't wait to try it. I loved the luxurious packaging and consistency of the cream but it didn't workout for me. Now, I will say I do have very sensitive skin so I don't step out of my skincare comfort zone often. I typically do fine with luxury skincare products though. I'm kind of sad it didn't workout for me but I'm going to give it to my daughter and see how it works for her. Even with this experience it won't be the last time I try this Brand.",
