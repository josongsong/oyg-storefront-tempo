I use the Color WOW Pop and Lock and spray down with the Dream Coat. I let it air dry about 80% before blow drying and flat ironing. I spray sections with the Color Wow Mistical Shine Spray. This is the first time I'm able to get all day results even in winter (California) My hair looks and feels soft and silkie all day. I love it!

        "comments": "My stylist recently recommended I try the Olaplex Shampoo, Conditioner, and Serum because my usually strong hair started to react negatively to the highlighting and color treatments that we do. My hair is strong and has held up well. But when it suddenly started to rebel, I didn't like how frizzed out my hair looked, even after my stylist had treated and applied a deep conditioner. My stylist said: \"You need to use a better set of products between hair appointments\".   My stylist has never tried to \"sell me\" on certain products. But when my hair needed to be repaired, he recommended Olaplex. He said that Olaplex had consistently impressed him over the years. He told me a bit about the history of the product line, who created it, who used it, etc. I was intrigued. I live in NYC so a good haircut and coloring job is expensive. I figured that since I'm already paying a pretty penny for the right stylist, why not invest a bit in a solid product line to treat my damaged hair. My stylist liked other products in the Olaplex line, but since I was looking to keep costs down, I went with the basics and tried Olaplex shampoo, conditioner, and serum on his recommendation.   WOW! My hair had looked damaged - broken and fried. It also needed moisture. In just one use, I noticed a very significant improvement. After just two uses, my hair looked healed! It was like new.   Also, I'm usually pretty adept at styling my hair. But in the last few years, because I have a lot of thick hair, I had trouble getting my short, stacked, bob to look totally smooth with my blow drying. The cut and color were amazing. But I could never get the blow out really smooth on my own. My arm would get tired while blow-drying. I also don't have a super-powerful blow drier either. I tried all sorts of smoothing products, including Aragon oil. But my hair always looked a bit frizzed. Not when my stylist dried it. Only when I did.   Then, I tried Olaplex. I couldn't believe the results from the serum. I'm sure it was the combo of all three products that helped. But the serum is amazing. I was finally able to get a smooth blow out. It's not as good as my stylist's, but it's significantly better than it was. My stylist noticed it immediately.   Thank you, Olaplex, for developing such a great line. I've already recommended you to others. Keep up the solid, consistent effort! Don't change a thing....  From, A \"Happy\" New Yorker",

        "comments": "I love everything olaplex, this is the first product I found to be underwhelming. I use their bonding oil, and styling cream, their benefits are clear to me. The oil gives shine, detangles, heat protection. The style cream provides heat protection and holds style from curl iron. This hair serum did not seem to do anything different for my hair. No extra shine, and not sure about heat protection. I used a few times, and every time I didn't notice it doing anything. My hair did not feel or seem nourished or shiny. Maybe it's good for people who are exposed to more elements of pollution and things like that. The texture is very slimy, which I found a little unsettling LOL. Either way, maybe this is good for people who need protection from environmental factors. I trust olaplex as a brand, so I have to think this is just not for me",
