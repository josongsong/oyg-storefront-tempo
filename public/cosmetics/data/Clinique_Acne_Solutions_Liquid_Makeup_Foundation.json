Constant break outs, it clings to any dry patches…but over all it looks extremly cakey and dry on the skin. I tried multiple different moisturizers and primers but nothing seemed to work. I then decided to look into it and read that the formula had been changed. How unfortunate…I went out and purchashed a completely different foundation of another brand that has given me no problems. I would NOT recommend this foundation.",

        "comments": "This is my first review of a Clinique product, though I have been using them for a few years. In looking at the somewhat mixed reviews of this product. I think people don't understand that this product is for a certain type of skin (oily and acne prone) and to be used as part of a particular type of regimen (do not mix this with other acne topicals unless you intend to).\n\nThis foundation works GREAT for me. Mainly, it DOES NOT BREAK ME OUT like nearly every other foundation and even many other Clinique products I seriously break out from so many things, I have to be super careful about what I put on my face.\n\nI give this five stars because this product is made for oily and acne prone skin, yet it works like a high end foundation. THANK YOU for making make up that those of us with very picky skin and easily clogged pores can use.\n\nThis has salacylic acid acne medication in it. This is why it is not for the faint of heart. You are basically putting a specific acne MEDICINE all over your face. SA is often used in \"spot\" treatments but it really is better as an all-over preventative. But using too much of is (such as mixing with another SA topical, or other acne topicals, you can go too far and irritate your skin. So I use this with only sunscreen or moisturizer underneath it during the day, and use any other acne medicine at night.\n\nSA causes the top layer of your skin to turn over faster, basically. For those of us whose skin clogs because, in part, the top layer is not turning over fast enough (there are other factors too) this is great to have incroporated into a foundation that also doesn't break you out. If you don't need it, it might be slighly irritating like if you used too much retinol or something similar.\n\nTL;DR: If you have oliy and break-out skin and have responded well to salacylic acid in the past, are looking for a foundation with some buildable coverage, oil control, and if you already have a sunscreen or moisturizer you like to wear under your foundation, give this a try.",

When I saw this item I thought well the other acne products work very well so lets give this a try. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nAfter using for a few weeks I started getting worse than usual breakouts and this was the only thing I changed in my daily skin regimine. It goes on too thick and doesn't cover like it says it does. It feels like a think layer on top of the skin and does not cover the redness. After 5 hours of wear my skin was getting shiny and oily.\n\nWhen I spoke to a Clinique consultant they recommended a powder on top of the makeup to \"set it in\". So now it feels even thicker on my skin and I am having to buy 2 products to do the job of one!\n\nThe Clarifying Powder was an awesome procduct that controled shiny, oily skin, helped with breakouts, and went on in a few seconds.\n\nWith this new product you have to work it from the center of your face to the hairline, as stated by their \"how to\" instructions. Doing this will stretch the delicate skin layers and cause wrinkles.\n\nI am not at all happy with this new product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWhy doesn't clinique keep the products that acne customers like and ADD to the options available for oily and acne skin customers. The customers with regular skin have numerous options, but we only have a few items to choose from. Maybe it's time to look at other makeup lines.",
