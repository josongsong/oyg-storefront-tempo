I have tried loads of high and anti-aging eye creams, and I finally found the one for me! I enjoy the non-sticky formula and the results I am getting. You twist the top of the bottle to expose the pump, which I love! The bottle seems to be lasting a long time, making it even more cost effective. Finally found my holy grail eye cream! Seriously, just add it to the cart already😍😂",

        "comments": "Bring back the original, this product is terrible for people with sensitive skin. It dries out your eyes, makes them look dehydrated and my lines look ten times worse than they ever have. It also burns! I use a thin layer every few days! I do not recommend! The original was 1000 times better! I used it for years and I miss it like crazy after not having it for 1 month. Why change a perfect product?",
