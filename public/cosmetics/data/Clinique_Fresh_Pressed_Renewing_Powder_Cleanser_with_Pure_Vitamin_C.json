Other products I've tried either irritated my skin or oxidized (turned orange and spoiled) within a week of opening the bottle.

It cost way more than I really wanted to spend but with their return policy I figured why not? I'm SO happy I bought this!! Within 1 week I started to see results! I've been using this now for about 3 weeks & my complexion has cleared up the pigmentation & all the other issues I had! \nThe ONLY downside is it can dry your face a little bit. So get a good moisturizer too. (I use Gold Bond) Other then that I highly, highly recommend this product!!",

        "comments": "Literally 'sunshine in a sachet' for my face! I use one sachet every morning on lightly dampened skin. It mildly cleanses and therefore would be unsuitable for evening use and removing makeup, which is probably why the instructions state to use in the morning. I massage this into my skin for about 30 seconds and rinse off. Immediately there is a noticeable glow to my skin which I love, however I'm not so keen on the powder consistency - it's so fine that when you tear open the top of the sachet and pour into your palm, some of it disperses into the air, so best to hold away from you. The first time I opened one, even though level to my waist, I could actually taste some of the powder as I inhaled. Now I just hold my breath when opening as I don't think it's all that beneficial to ingest this stuff! But nevertheless a brilliant product...non-stripping or drying in any way, on my normal/combination skin type. The Vitamin C in this gives me a lovely glow and the Salicylic acid helps with skin texture so I'm getting the best of both worlds when I use this. -> My 'Ulta Beauty Top 7 must-have list' (My 7 favorite beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Ulta) < - < 1.

My skin is just brighter, and if you give it enough time, dark spots will brighten up. They won't disappear, this is a cleanser, not a laser, but makeup becomes easier to apply, less concealer is necessary. PLUS, I get 3 uses out of each packet; just pour about 1/3 in your palm, then fold up the packet and use it again. I know exposure to oxygen can lessen the effects, but this seems to work for me.",

I haven't touched my murad lightner since I purchased this still use my luna oil. I have used the 28 packets and I'm on my second box. I did notice some dryness due to the Luna oil but other then that this will forever be in my regime. It gives you a instant glow and helps with acne scars you just have to be patient. Hopefully Clinique comes out with bigger packets since it only comes with 28. I haven't used the serum booster because I feel like this has done it for me. I had hormonal cyst acne and now I just see one or two due too Mother Nature but who can stop that.",
