I live in Florida and it survived the scorching and humid summer heat, walking outside in 95° weather as well. I highly recommend, especially if you have oily skin.",

It made my skin horribly dry to the point of making my makeup look cakey and causing my skin to flake. I thought it was a one-time thing and possibly I used another drying product, so I used it a second time on another occasion and had the same dry feeling. My face felt horribly tight, so I tried to spray some thermal water over, and it did not help. I do not recommend this product if you have dry or sensitive skin.",

The product is no better than drugstore setting sprays but at a ridiculous price point. ELF and Milani have setting sprays that out-performs CT. For higher-end setting sprays, BeneFit and Tarte have far superior versions.",

So, I saw that one of my coworkers saw Melanie Martinez last year and his makeup STAYED (keep in mind that the concert was in summer) and I was really curious so I bought the mini and tried it out. it kept my makeup in place! the first time I used it, it felt like I had a second skin (almost like a filmy layer) but the other times I used it, it has never been an issue. I was scared because of the scent since I have super sensitive skin but it hasn't broken me out (I hope it stays that way). I will say tho, I do layer my makeup differently. I either use this spray to help melt in my cream products or I'll use the classic Mac fix+. Anyway, I recently saw aventura and I used this as my final spray to lock everything in and yallllllll it stayed in place! no touch ups whatsoever and I left the house at around 4pm but the concert started at 9pm so I was out and about, but, everything was good! I will say— THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE SPRAY AND MY EXPERIENCE ONLY. so, if it doesn't work for you, I'm sorry. :( if it does end up working for you, that's great! either way, we all have different skin and if our skin likes something else, that's totally fine! :D",

My face didn't feel sticky or anything after spraying, but if I got water on my face. My foundation was gone underneath. I have bangs so I have to get my bangs wet to style them and if I get any water along my hairline, my foundation was gone. But I never had that issue if I didn't use this spray. Also if I brush my teeth while I have foundation on and I happen to get like a drop of water on my chin, have a drip mark where the water was, and I'll have to figure out how to patch that up with more foundation. This is definitely not for me, especially living in the Pacific Northwest. I'm sure if it rained in I got any drops of water on my face. I would have streaky marks on my face. Or if I cried, I bet this would leave tears streaks down my cheeks. I think I'm gonna stick to spray because that seems to work best. I'm glad I got this as a free sample. I would not spend the money on this at all.",
