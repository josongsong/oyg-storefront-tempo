Within seconds, I noticed my face was burned. I had large red patches, so I quickly washed my face again with my regular cleanser and only apply a gentle oil to my face to let it rest from any harsh ingredients. Never again will I use this on my sensitive skin. :(",

It's just that the Calendula Extract, Articum Lappa Extract and Allantoin ALL come AFTER very cheap, generic ingredients. Sure, the ones listed above are relatively \"premium\" but I mean come on. Even the preservative (Methylparaben) is listed before any of those ingredients. I wanted to give it 3 stars because of how overpriced it is, and how it should be priced like their Cucumber Toner, BUT it does perform very well for oily & sensitive skin -- which is very hard to find.\n\n**As a note, here are all the ingredients that come before Calendula (for which the product was named): Water, Propylene Glycol (a little scary as the 2nd most concentrated ingredient), Pentylene Glycol, Methylparaben and Disodium EDTA.",
