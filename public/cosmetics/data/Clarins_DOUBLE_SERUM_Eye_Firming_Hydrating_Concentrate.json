The first thing that happened was it stopped dispensing the cream in the middle and would only dispenser the clear serum. Then it stopped working altogether. Still have a decent amount of product in the bottle that I can't get out. it's been awhile since I bought it,  so probably can't return it, but will have to take a hammer or a screwdriver to the bottle to be able to use it up. Too expensive to deal with that hassle.",

And, now I have been using their Double Eye Serum for a couple weeks and really like it. I like all of Clarins's skin care products. I also like being a member of Clarins, because they sent me a Holiday Gift!!!! I was really surprised and thought it was a really nice gesture! Just in case you're wondering what it was, it was a good size eye make up remover, a good size sample of their eye cream and reusable pads to remove the make up plus a little pouch. It is very nice and very much appreciated. I've been using Clarins for over 25 years and expect to continue to do so. Take care of your skin!!!!! Beautiful skin is within your reach, just use Clarins consistently like I do.",

When it got lower it still had quite a lot of oil left but no white substance. I spoke to the Clarins rep at the store and she suggested that I needed to make sure the dispenser setting was exactly on the label. I bought a second lot and checked it was on the setting every time I used it. Same thing happened. I won't be buying this again (which is a shame as I like it) and I will be taking back to my local rep to complain. It's expensive and I can't use it all up, so I feel I'm being ripped off by Clarins with this product.",
