        "comments": "Clinique Strawberry Fudge Duo is my favorite eye shadow. I'm 65 years old and still have good skin and not many wrinkles. This duo I use the pink over the lid and under the brow, the brown I use in the crease and along the lash line to soften eye liner and flare it at the outer corners. It adds a little shimmer and depth without looking overly made up as I prefer a natural look. I've tried many other eye shadows but always come right back to this one.",

The first picture (which I ordered from) showed a duo with pink undertones (more like their blackened pink honey eye collection).  I was expecting a more pink/black honey collection duo as first pictured online.  However, when I received it, there is no pink or black honey undertones...it's definitely all purple.  Not happy with my purchase and live too far to return to store.",

Second, I was disappointed to learn that my favorite (No Show Taupes) was discontinued. Regardless, I purchased the new product to give it a try. Unfortunately, the new product was a huge disappointment. The eye shadow is too shimmery (not a good look on mature women) and it doesn't have any staying power. The new product appears to be tailored towards the tween/teen market. After being a loyal Clinique customer for the past 20+ years, I will need to find another product better suited for mature women.",
