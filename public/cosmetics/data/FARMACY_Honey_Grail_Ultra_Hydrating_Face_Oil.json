I like to apply it as the final layer after moisturizer to lock in hydration overnight.  Over the past few weeks, it has helped get rid of flakiness and roughness on my face.  Beyond using it for skincare purposes, I love to mix it with matte foundations so I can get the long-wear benefits but with a dewy, radiant finish.  I've also placed this oil in my hair from the mid-lengths down and have found that it has softened my strands, minimized frizz, and repaired damage.  Gifted by Farmacy Beauty.",

This product has quickly become a must-have in my skincare routine.\n\nOne of the first things I noticed is the lovely, thicker texture of the oil. It feels luxurious upon application and provides an instant sense of nourishment to my skin. Unlike lighter oils that can sometimes feel too slippery or evaporate quickly, the Honey Grail has a nice, rich consistency that I find perfect for deeply hydrating my skin.\n\nAfter incorporating this face oil into my routine, I've noticed a significant improvement in how my skin looks and feels. It appears healthier and more hydrated, with a natural glow that I love. My complexion feels plump and well-moisturized, and I appreciate how it helps to lock in hydration throughout the day.\n\nI also love that it absorbs beautifully without leaving a greasy residue, making it easy to layer under my moisturizer or sunscreen. It truly enhances my overall skincare regimen and has brought so much life back to my skin.\n\nIn summary, the Farmacy Honey Grail Ultra-Hydrating Face Oil is a fantastic product that delivers on its promises. If you're looking for an effective way to boost your skin's hydration and achieve a healthy glow, I highly recommend giving this oil a try. Your skin will definitely thank you!\n\nI received this facial oil complimentary from farmacybeauty for my honest opinion",

Doesn't he realize you can check online between the older packaging version versus the new one and compare the ingredients list?  LOL",
