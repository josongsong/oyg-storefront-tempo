For me, less is more, and I'm using this to set concealer only (specifically, the NYX Bare with Me serum & the Ulta Beauty Color Correcting Concealer). \nIt's finely milled, doesn't look cakey, does control oil, and evens out my skin tone. As for building the coverage, I set the powder with a water mister rather than using a wet applicator. At then end, yes, texture is still visible but softened. My face looks great in natural light, plus it photographs well. Overall, I'm happy with it, but the cost is a splurge.",
