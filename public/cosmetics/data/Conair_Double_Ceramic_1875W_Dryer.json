She wasn't even using it that much, she washes her hair every 2-3 days and she has fine, straight hair that dries quickly so it was barely used in this time frame. I am now purchasing her a Babyliss in hopes it will last longer. Save your money and choose a different brand.",

I have to admit, I'm utterly delighted simply because smooth, shiny hair is always in style and the Conair Double Ceramic Dryer®️ gives you just that! \n\nConair's Double Ceramic Dryer®️ boasts 2X ceramic technology for seriously smooth results. This thing really cuts down on drying time, which is a lifesaver in the morning. It leaves my hair so smooth and shiny, not all dried out and frizzy. I can practically feel the static disappear when I use it. Styling is so much easier now that my hair is healthier.  Seriously, it's like a mini spa treatment for your hair every time you dry it.\n\nWith 3 heat and 2 speed settings, you'll have total control over your style. This thing will give you the best hair of your life. Seriously, the volume and shine are unreal. The diffuser creates gorgeous, bouncy curls, no problem. And if sleek and straight is more your vibe, the concentrator delivers. It's so easy to use, you'll ditch your old one immediately. \n\nConair's®️ Infrared technology is a total game-changer for my hair care routine! It's surprisingly gentle on my strands unlike other dryers I've tried in the past. This hair dryer is amazing! It really does dry my hair super fast. My hair feels so much healthier and less frizzy. I've noticed way more shine too, which is a huge plus. Definitely recommend checking this one out.",

It was very pretty, came with an attachment for curly hair and one for targeted drying. Pink, shiny, sleek and stylish. I didn't find it to be overly loud. Let me just say, it works. It doesn't work all that will though. I noticed right away that it just doesn't have the power I wanted it to have. It typically takes me about 15 minutes to thoroughly blow dry my medium volume, shoulder length hair. I typically use a baby bliss blow dryer. It takes me about 30 min to totally dry my hair using this. Despite the longer drying time, I haven't noticed any damage that this caused, so that's good. I guess you have to ask yourself if you mind sacrificing the time?  For me that's a no.",
