        "comments": "I bought this product to try and help with fine lines and puffiness. To be fair, I don't have anything crazy for wrinkles so I knew that change would be probably minimal. This product is honestly a little difficult to use because if you use to much it leaves this white flaky layer behind. If you use to little, sparingly like they recommend, then there is no benefit to the product. I do sometimes notice a firming like feel around my eyes but i think it depends on how much product I use. It does not work well under makeup because of the flaking and have even gotten down to one small \"drop\" and still had the flaking.",

        "comments": "I was hopeful about this product considering I'm in the Louis Vuitton of permanent under-eye bags club. I've tried so many of these products from the high dollar (PTR/Badescu/etc) to now this more budget friendly one from Cover Girl. So I keep my expectations somewhat low as my bags are hereditary not from a lack of sleep. While this product seems to work some - I could feel a little tightening of the skin, it is a finicky product. The directions say put on after liquid foundation. Doing that created a whitish dry looking ick under my eye, so I tried to lightly rub it away, that was terrible. So I tried using it before I put on my BB foundation, it rubbed off as I applied the foundation. The only time I felt like it didn't peel or create a gross look was when I went makeup free - just my regular skincare routine and this. This seems to be the norm with all of these under-eye bag \"depuffers\" that seem to work - they create an ick under that peels or looks kinda gross. Another brand directs you to actually lightly rub it away after it dries but I felt like thay actually made my bags return. So I guess I'll just keep on rocking these Louis Vuitton bags for ever. I do hope others have better luck!",

It doesn't seem to treat the skin and is extremely easy to use too much product, causing pilling on your skin. Even if you use a tiny amount, it causes a sticky film on the skin that can peel up later. I doubt it would work well under concealer.",

They all turn white if you use to. much.  By reading other reviews I read some were putting it on at night.  WHY?  Eye serums are for a temporary time to make you look good when you go to work or a night out.  It doesn't accumulate over time and make your puffiness better. I would like this product to be just a bit thicker because it is very runny.  The worst thing about this product is the tube itself.  Still really haven't figured it out.  I pull and twist the complete nozzel out which is really a pain.",

And my husband always has puffy under eyes and never uses any product on his face or around his eyes so I thought even the lightest under eye serum would surely help with his puffiness under his eyes. We both used it and neither of us could tell a difference unfortunately. I was really bummed, and I thought just if he try some kind of under eye product ut help with his puffiness/circles. Which by the way aren't that bad He is 31 just looks like allergies.  But I guess I picked the wrong product because he straight up told me he noticed nothing different  and not to waste any more money on any more of these face products lol. But I also didn't notice a difference for either of us unfortunately. Just being honest. I wouldn't ever buy this again.",

This one, however, leaves no residue at all and I just applied after all my makeup was on using a flat brush and swooped in on rather than pat it on. Great results though not quite as dramatic as Firm X and price is great.",

        "comments": "i have tried a whole bunch of different eye serums. I turned 40 this year and started to notice just the very beginnings of fine lines, dark circles and bags under and around my eyes. Ive tried lots of creams, some were too strong leaving my skin burning or irritated. Others were so greasy and never really seemed to absorb. Still others felt great but never seemed to make a noticeable difference. When i was given the chance to try Cover girls product i was stoked. I have been a long time user of their products and was excited to try this. The formula is not greasy or oily, it went on smooth and didnt leave a residue. I didnt notice any tingling or burning as i have with other products. I chose to apply this product in the evening after my normal skin routine. I awoke the next morning and noticed a visible improvement with the bags under my eyes. The skin under my eye appeared tighter and brighter. As i stated i have very few fine lines and cannot remark on whether those improved because i have only been using the product about a week and i was more concernes with the bags than the fine lines. This product is comparable to other high end brands in looks and quality /results. I am also super happy to know that this is yet another cruelty free product from cover girl. I have already recommended this product to several friends and coworkers and im curious to find out how they feelm",

        "comments": "This is some serious stuff!\nI received this serum as part of a VoxBox campaign with Covergirl. WOW! I could not believe my eyes. It works. Ever since I was a teenager I've always had puffiness and black circles under my eyes, I guess I am used to them now. This stuff disappeared all the puffiness in 2 minutes.\nBut, and this is a big but: you have to be very carefull and follow the instructions properly, otherwise it won't work. It is truly complicated to find the perfect amount of product to apply and the perfect b\"technique\" without messing everything up. It is because this level of complexity that I am giving it 3 stars. If you don't apply it correctly or if you apply too much or too little it won't work and it will even start to dry out in the middle of the day, leaving you some very bad white residues and ruining your makeup all the way.\nBut if you are extra careful and find the perfect amount for you to use, you'll be impressed. Having said that, let me tell you, I was that impressed that got my +70yr old mom in law to try it. It was like giving her an instant face lift. She was sold istanlty. \nSo, if you're interested in having a really complicated but wonderful magic wand, run to the drugstore, this is for you! #EazyBreezyBeautiful #SimplyAgeless",
