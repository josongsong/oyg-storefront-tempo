However, I just bought 3 travel size (1.5 oz) bottles to put in my carry-on luggage and it is an entirely different product. It does not hold my hair at all. I will never get this again. I've read that they have changed the formula and wonder if I have been using the old formula. I buy 10-20 cans at a time and am still using my old supply. If this is how the new version is going to be, I will need to find a new brand of hairspray because this stuff is useless.",

I will still keep this one, but using differently. I do miss the Kenra 25 I had been using for over 15 years.",

I have hair extremely prone to frizz, and most hairsprays will frizz my hair.  This hairspray does not frizz my hair.  Spray and leave for a firmer hold.  Spray and brush out for a softer hold.  Gives volume all day (13+ hours is what I've seen).  Bought the travel size, immediately bought the full size (to save the travel size for travel).   Life-changing product for me!",
