The Iconic London Prep-Set-Glow Hydrating Setting Spray has quickly become a staple in my beauty regimen. Its multi-use functionality makes it incredibly versatile, serving as both a makeup primer and a finishing spray. I've found that it effectively preps my skin before makeup application, creating a smooth canvas and extending the wear of my foundation. Additionally, as a setting spray, it locks in my makeup all day, ensuring a flawless finish. The infusion of cucumber and chamomile extracts not only imparts a refreshing sensation but also leaves my skin feeling hydrated and revitalized. Moreover, the inclusion of antioxidants, green tea, and vitamin E provides added nourishment, while caffeine helps combat dark circles, making it a skincare essential for busy days and late nights. Using the Iconic London Prep-Set-Glow Setting Spray is truly a sensorial delight. The fine mist envelops my skin in a refreshing veil, awakening my senses with its subtle cucumber scent. Its lightweight texture feels weightless on the skin, imparting a dewy glow without any stickiness or residue. I love the luminous finish it provides, adding a touch of radiance to my complexion that lasts throughout the day. Each spritz is like a revitalizing burst of hydration, leaving me feeling invigorated and ready to take on the day. Whether you're prepping your skin for makeup application, setting your finished look, or simply refreshing your bare face, this setting spray delivers on its promises. Beauty enthusiasts, skincare aficionados, and makeup artists alike will appreciate its versatility and transformative effects. Incorporating it into your beauty routine is sure to elevate your glow game to iconic levels. It's become a must-have in my makeup bag, and I can't wait to continue incorporating it into my daily routine.",

I went on ahead and purchased it (in my monthly Boxycharm subscription box) and I truly looked forward to when I could use it because it had shimmer/glitter and so much glow.  But as soon as I sprayed it on my face I instantly got a migraine!!!  I could not wait to get my makeup off that night and just be free of that strong smell...it was really disappointing!!  I wish it had been packaged that it was very scented and I would have stayed far away...Come on marketing reps...this info needs to be put on the packaging for us that are scent sensitive..and wish we was not this way!!!  I could not \"return\" this item as it was in my subscription box with Boxycharm...so it is a total loss for me!!!!",
