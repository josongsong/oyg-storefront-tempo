        "comments": "Alittle over a year ago I began to develop rosacea. The texture of my skin is great, but I have constant redness, painful flushing, and very dry and sensitive skin. Recently my dermatologist prescribed a cream to help combat flushing, but it leaves my skin SO incredibly tight and red, it feels like plaster and is painful to make any facial expression or smile or open my mouth to eat. And dry tight skin = red skin. I have been living horribly. My skin used to be my pride and joy, then I began to never leave the house because of it. And on top of that, whether anyone saw me or not, it was incredibly uncomfortable and painful. I dug out this old cream I used to get from my dermatologist years and years ago when my skin would get occasionally dry and winter. I was desperate for something that could give me some relief so I could see my old face again for the first time in years. And it is a LIFE SAVER. IMMEDIATELY after putting it on my skin felt incredibly flexible and comfortable and the redness has decreased significantly. Normally, touching my face at all causes it to flare up, but putting this on my face was nothing but comfort. This brand has literally given me my life back. I immediately went out and did things with friends because I felt like my old self again. And it is a GREAT feeling. This cream is great for rosacea, dry skin, redness, and sensitivity, all of which I have. I cannot believe the amount of issues it has corrected for me in just one day. If it continues to work like this I will never switch to anything else!",

        "comments": "Five stars for product quality and performance. It has all the qualities I was searching for. It is rich, ultra hydrating, thick and goes on smoothly. The winters are long and drying in New England. I wanted this as my everyday, go-to moisturizer. The moment I opened it and caught wind of the scent was my usual \"oh, no...\". I absolutely detest the signature scent of AVENE (yet I love the product!). It is strong, it lingers and frequently can be irritating. Why would company that is know for making products for people with sensitive skin use a horrible fragrance? It is a bitter/floral/old-lady cheap perfume scent. Horrible. I could live with a scent which was subtle, did not linger and fresh. Please consider remaking your signature scent.",
