I straighten my hair and curl it. I recommended it to my friend as well for her daughter because she loved the way I would style my hair. Her daughter is obsessed with it as well. However, I would NEVER recommend putting it on the highest setting. Place it on the middle setting for best results.",

This flat iron heats up quickly, making it perfect for anyone in a hurry to style their hair before going out or for those with back-to-back clients. It truly delivers!\n\nAfter styling my clients' hair, I'm almost always asked which flat iron I'm using. Whether I'm straightening, curling, or creating waves, the results are frizz-free and long-lasting.\n\nHowever, I do have two drawbacks to mention. First, the price point is a bit high, especially if you don't plan to use it consistently. Second, the plates on the outside get very hot! When I first used my loaned Nano, no one mentioned this detail, and I burned my fingers a few times. \n\nThe heated plates are a great feature, as long as you remember they're there.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with my Babyliss!",

I use Redken Diamomd oil and Alterna heat spray (blue bottle not Bamboo) for heat protectant as well. \nThis iron is HEAVY DUTY, built to last and feels very PRO. \nVERY long cord.\nwide plates that are rounded on the edge, so it makes tight curls, beautifully, for my pinup style. \nLadies... I never leave reviews but this thing has seriously changed me. I would dread washing my hair knowing that i had to flat iron afterward. Thia makes me happy to do my hair ans cut the time by half.\n\nBest money ive spent at ULTA",
