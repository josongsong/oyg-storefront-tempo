The initial claims on the packaging say \"clinically tested to retain skins moisture for up to 48 hrs, dermatologically tested.\" I'm someone that has very sensitive, dry, prone to breakouts on my chin, red skin. I do suffer from rosacea and the dry skin on my cheeks sometimes it a lot to deal with. This cream has significantly helped it and has not caused a flare up that I can usually get with other products. The cream itself is nice and lightweight, not oily or tacky once applied. It sinks right into your skin and doesn't leave behind a weird residue feel. I'm usually someone that doesn't like scented stuff, but the scent on this is so light and smells lightly citrus with a hint of herbal. The smell fades once the cream has sunk into the skin. The biggest thing that I've mentioned and love about this is it did not break me out or flare up any skin issues I have.  This product is made in Korea and with all the hype surrounding kbeauty products and that glass skin look, I think I am sold and will continue to use this cream over time!",

It feels a little numb in and around the area I put on when it sets into my skin. It also made my skin look a little blotchy. It looks like I am allergic to it.",
