I'm not familiar with many of Clinique products, but every product I've tried was pretty good. I saw this on sale, and purchased it, glad I did. It's a very fine poof of water droplets onto your face, and instantly, your face is hydrated. I think this beats my favorite rose water, I'm obsessed with spritzing my face and delicate neck and chest area. This is a new staple in my skin regimen.",

Since I hadn't tried it, I did think of all the facial sprays I bought before that did nothing. What I did know though was that this was a Clinique spray AND a Moisture Surge one at that and I LOVE every Moisture Surge product I own. I purchased it anyways and as soon as it arrived I gave it a go. Wow. It really does hydrate. It can stand on it's own for that quick \"drink of water\" for your skin, but where this really shines is when used in combination with other MS products. What I do after cleasing my face is apply the MS Supercharged Concentrate. Once that is absorbed, I use a little MS Extended Thirst Relief (or MS Overnight Mask) on top, apply my All About Eyes Rich and a lipbalm. The last thing I do is use this MS spray all over my face. It supplies all of the other products with that much more moisture to grab on to and push into the skin and makes them work 10 times better than just on their own. My skin is thriving and is so much softer, smoother, plump and fresh. This facial spray does look \"spendy\" on the surface but I feel it is an investment in my skincare. My skin looks so much better lately and that makes me feel better about myself. I feel that way about all the MS products I own and I have no doubt that any products introduced into this line will be equally superb. \n\nPS. Clinique: any thoughts of making a dedicated Moisture Surge cleanser?",

It was less expensive, and a spray seemed more convenient than a cream. I was wrong. The spray is like a film. It leaves a weird feeling on your skin. It doesn't feel fresh. My skin doesn't seem as moisturized as when I used the cream. I should have stuck with the cream.",
