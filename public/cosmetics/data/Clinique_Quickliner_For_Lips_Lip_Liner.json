I will say it does have a long power stay though but another flaw is you cant tell how much there is bcs it doesnt really go up or down at all but pretty color just not for me",

        "comments": "I love these. One of my best features are my full lips that are naturally berry red; blue-based or berry lip colors work really well on me. These liners provide shades in the same color family but some are light and others provide depth, giving me variety for work or play. The also serve as an anchor for lip colors. Sky Violet is currently my favorite for daytime. They make whatever I'm wearing, chubby stick, lipstick, almost lipstick, gloss, last a long time; they are a great foundation for layering color in a way to appear polished and pulled together. I wear Crushed Berry with Fireberry lipgloss or A Different Grape (or both) to make a statement. Sky Violet with Shy Honey almost lipstick is my current go-to for work and matches Iced Lotus or Cupid or Shy Blush in creamwear. I can also use it with Lilac Superbalm or Luscious Lilac lip plump. These are like wearing nude colors with shine, but without the brown or orange base. Shy Violet or Pink Truffle works great with my chubby sticks in Bountiful Blush or Voluptuous Violet, or chubby intense in Grandest Grape. While I don't have much of a problem with feathering, the corners of my lips tend to bleed or are the first place the glosses or lipsticks wear away, so these lipliners keep the color even and consistent. I like all the options these give me; I'm not limited to one shade for all my lip color needs. Best of all, my lips never look as though the lipstick has worn away and I'm left with dark lines around the borders of my mouth.",

I was very disappointed. I wasn't even able to purchase it from Clinique.com. In any event, I decided to try the new intense lip liners. I bought Intense Sassafras and Intense Cafe. In general, I don't really like the product. It does not glide onto the lips and it has a funny smell. As for color, the Intense Sassafras is fine, looks very much like Honeystick, but the Intense Cafe is too warm a color, especially under cooler lipsticks, and makes all my nude colors look orangey. I will try Intense Cola, but I do think that will be too dark.",
