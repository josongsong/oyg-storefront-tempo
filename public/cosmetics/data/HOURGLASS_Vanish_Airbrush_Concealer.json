It has great coverage, looks airbrushed, and I thought I had found the perfect concealer for my blemishes. Sadly, it broke me out every time I used it and aggrivated my acne! Something in this is not good for sensitive skin. It's also really expensive for a concealer. I love Hourglass products but this was a miss for me. I think their blushes and bronzers are their bread and butter, ao I'll stick with those.",

As I've gotten older, it has become more and more difficult to find out that doesn't look crepey under my eyes after I've set it and last all day. This one goes on smooth and covers well with only one coat. What I really like though is that because it is so light weight, almost like a serum, I can use a second coat for even more coverage without having to worry about it looking heavy. It last all day as well. I put on my makeup around 8am and when I get home from work at 6, it still looks the same without any touch ups. I did find that it oxidizes some, so you may want to go 1 shade lighter as it will darken just a little but not to a bad color. Highly recommend",

Now unfortunately after 2 days I started getting a bad skin reaction and upon reading ingredients it has Myristic Acid, which tends to be a no go for those of us with acne prone skin. It is an ingredient rated a 5/5 on the comedogenic scale. This was the only change in my routine and after discontinuing use of this concealer my skin went back to normal in 2 days. This is unfortunately the reaction I have with products that contain Myristate or Myristic Acid is found in this product. Pictures to show",
