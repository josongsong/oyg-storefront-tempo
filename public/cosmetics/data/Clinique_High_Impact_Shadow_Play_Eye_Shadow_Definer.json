I use the cream lightly on most of lid and apply the powder on outer area using an IT eye brush to blend and apply more powder.  Also apply powder using the IT brush to the underneath eye area.  Otherwise, the powder was too heavy looking for my preference.  Shadow lasts all day on my oily eyelids with no creasing.  I receive many compliments on the Cafe Au Lait!  Only complaint is I cannot tell when the powder is almost empty and the stick side falls out at times.",

My makeup bag has been bogged down by shadows and liners for decades in order to get just the right smokey eye or professional day or even back in my modeling days when dramatic eyes were a must.  It's an all in one solution. The creamy side blends beautifully and the shadow, which also blends better than anything I've ever used, is perfect for casual to formal. It's easy to add to the look for evening with a few simple strokes.  I REALLY hope the negative reviews don't impact availability of this most excellent product.  I've bought five different shades and am buying more today.  Great for both young and older skin.  Lasts all day and never gets sticky or hard to blend. Clinique, you hit the ball out of the park with this duo stick!",

        "comments": "I have been using Clinique makeup for at least 20 years and have loved the chubby sticks for as long as they have been around. I am devastated that they were discontinued. \nThis product is an awful replacement for the chubby sticks. The cream shadow is pretty similar in composition, but the stick is narrower and shorter. So it gets mediocre coverage and runs out quickly. It's absolutely not worth the price if you are looking for a product to replace the chubby sticks. \nThe 'powder' side of the product is okay. It doesn't blend well with the applicator. I always end up with far too much/too dark or I end up blending it with my fingers. \nThis product manages to disappoint me with both sides. I will be looking into other brands for my makeup needs going forward.",
