While I like the consistency and that it is fragrance free, plus rapidly absorbs, it didn't do anything, not for the price. In the store, it definitely looked like my dark circles were lighter, but truth be told, they're still just as dark and my eyes are still puffy. Not worth the price and I have yet to find one eye cream that works.",

I put it on and it feels ok but then it dries down to a crusty white in a couple hours. My makeup pills terribly on it. When I wake up there's white crust on my lashes. I'm so grossed out by this! I live in LA where it's hot and somewhat dry and this cream is making it worse. I couldn't even get halfway through the jar before wanting to throw it out and it's not cheap! I'm just using my face cream on my eyes until I find a replacement.",
