The puffiness of my eyes was also reduced, but not as much as the dark circles. This cream also has good hydration. It is a little tinted, so it helps reduce dark circles in that way, too. I evaluated whether it reduced the circles before I reapplied, so it's not just the tint that made me think it reduced them, don't worry.",

My skin always looks great.This eye cream nourishes my eye area and smooths lines. \n \nBefore this jar arrived my rating would be a solid 5. I rate this 1 because the jar is not full. Approximately 1/2 of product is simply not there. There's a bubble or hole where it should be. \nI've tried to exchange for a full jar multiple times using online chat and customer service calls with no resolution.I cannot get a live person on the phone to explain it.I understand mistakes happen in production. But for EL to make it impossible to resolve is wrong. \nIt's time for me to begin researching a different line who is responsive to its customers.",
