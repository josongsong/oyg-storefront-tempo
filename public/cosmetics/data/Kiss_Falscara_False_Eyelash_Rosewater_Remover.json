I use a soaked cotton ball (wet but not dripping) to place on my falscara lashes (eye closed) for about 5-10 secs and then gently swipe down with minimal pressure. Voila! Lashes slide right off. Afterwards, I use a qtip soaked in a bit of the remover to get any residue left at the lashline. \nI don't wear false lashes often, but when i do they are usually falscara and always removed with this remover. \nI did only give it 4 stars instead of 5 since the price point is well over what it should be comparatively and if i wore false lashes more often, it would be too expensive to buy regularly.",

The only thing I would say about this product is that I cleaned Lashes off with alcohol before and water to reuse them so I really feel like this is not a product that I would buy however I really like the fact that kiss products was very intentional on creating a specific lash remover designed specifically for lashes to have a long lasting effect for reuse. I definitely want to provide an honest review as I donâ€:tm:t want to receive something and just say how great it is but also to give my constructive feedback but otherwise itâ€:tm:s Lashes off with alcohol before and water to reuse them so I really feel like this is not a product that I would buy however I really like the fact that kiss products was very intentional on creating a specific lash remover designed specifically for lashes to have a long lasting effect for reuse.

Itâ€:tm:s not one strip of lash. Second, they are placed underneath your existing lash and not on top. I was a little afraid this would make my narrow eyes look even more closed but it didnâ€:tm:t. \n\nThey look a lot like extensions and blended amazingly well. Super easy to put on and not mess up. The downside? I had a lot of residue on my natural lashes when I took them off and I didnâ€:tm:t like how it felt. I also thought getting the residue off was pretty rough on my existing lashes. Soaking the lashes in remover several times wasnâ€:tm:t enough, so I had to rub them gently until all the funk came off. Kinda scary to see a natural lash or two come loose and fall out. \n\nIâ€:tm:m a little on the fence about this product and I think Iâ€:tm:ll give them one more shot before deciding if I like them enough to keep using them or not.",
