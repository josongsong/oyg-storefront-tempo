I only use it because I have to cover my rosacea and blotchiness that my rosacea creates. Excellent coverage for being a CC cream. Other brands that are matte don't make my skin glow like this does. I have textured combination skin too and this works best for me. Also, a little goes a long way with this product! Love it!",

It looks wonderful on my skin and doesn't settle into every pore around my nose and those pesky fine lines that are starting to show up. I love the glow it gives me and that it still looks good at the end of the day. It's a win for me. I was hesitant to give it another try, but I'm so glad I did.",

I knew I wasn't all the way happy with it, but one day I found my old sample of the regular and used it and the difference is huge. I wish there was a product mid-way between the two. I'd like 2/3 regular and 1/3 illumination, ideally. It's just really shimmery and I feel that it somewhat highlights the fine lines around my mouth and eyes. I'm still giving it 4 stars because the coverage and formula is great; I just wish it had less shimmer or a different sort of \"glow\" to it than what it has.",

        "comments": "I have the regular version of this product in the light color but it was too dark for me so I wanted to buy the lighter color, fair, thinking it would match me. I have dry skin so when I saw this illuminating version I got excited. I bought the shade fair but it was way too dark for me (see pic below). Honestly to me I felt like this fair shade should have been labeled as tan or medium it was no where near fair, I was very disappointed.",
