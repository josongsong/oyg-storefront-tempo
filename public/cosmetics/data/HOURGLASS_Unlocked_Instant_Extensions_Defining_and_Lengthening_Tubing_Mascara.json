This mascara really does an amazing job lengthening my short lashes. It gave my straight lashes definition and lifted them upwards. I love how it gave me the look of lash extensions without really having it. I loved that it didn't flake off or smudge. I found it very easy to take off. This is the first mascara that I only needed one coat to get the job done. I love this mascara so much that I'm always finding myself recommending it to all my friends. I'm definitely going to buy this mascara as soon as I run out.",

It's not easy to find so when I saw Hourglass made one I had to try it. This is a tubing mascara that removes easily with warm water. It's a very natural mascara that lengthens & separates but doesn't give that much volume/thickness. I personally love this formula and would repurchase when it's on sale.",

        "comments": "I've worn many mascaras, but Hourglass Unlocked Instant Extensions really transformed my lashes—without extensions! The comb‑style brush grabs each lash and coats them in the richest, blackest formula I've tried, giving a dramatic fanned‑out lift and length that looks like false lashes but feels surprisingly natural. What surprised me most was the staying power. It's a tubing formula using film‑forming technology, so it resists smudging and flaking all day—even under humidity or long hours—and it only comes off when I want it to: with warm water and a soft cloth. No harsh scrubbing needed. Despite the dramatic look, it wears lightweight and comfortable—no heaviness or clumping. It does dry down with a slightly firmer feel, so if you're after a soft fluttery lash, this may not be your vibe. But if you want visible length, lift, and polished definition, this will definitely deliver. To top it off, it's vegan, cruelty‑free, and free from harsh ingredients like parabens and formaldehydes. Hourglass even donates a portion of proceeds to animal rights causes, which makes me feel good about using it. All in all: this mascara replaced several of my others. If you're aiming for extreme length and definition—and hate smudgy raccoon eyes—it's absolutely worth it. Gifted by Hourglass.",

I put this on at 6am, go to work, and sometimes don't take it off until 6-8pm or later. It stays put with minimal smudging and flaking. I say minimal because obviously there's going to be *some* breakdown after 12+ hours. Maybe 1 or 2 flakes, or a small smudge, but it's nothing like the raccoon eyes I get with regular mascara.\n\nThe effect of this mascara is dramatic and lengthening, and separating, and it doesn't take a whole lot to build, so it's fairly quick and easy to apply with hardly any fuss. When I put this mascara on my lashes, they look voluminous, long, and curled. For reference, my lashes are pretty regular (they aren't super short or long, and they're not super sparse or thick).\n\nIf Hourglass came out with a brown shade, I would only buy the Hourglass formula, but since they don't have a brown shade, I also like Thrive Causemetics' tubing mascara. In comparison, the Hourglass formula is a bit more dramatic and lengthening than Thrive's but they both still give me that long-lasting, reliable, hastle-free advantage.\n\nI will not go back to regular mascara formulas; I'm sold on tubing formulas. To me, tubing formulas are the future, and I think they're a very innovative idea, considering all the cosmetics that we currently have on the market.",

        "comments": "At first this mascara was okay, decent enough. Yet, after about 2 weeks it seemed like it was already old. Clumping, comes off way too easily, and super thick, it doesn't coat individual lashes it will coat and clump your lashes all together, I even try to use less but it's hard to with this formula. With other mascaras I can use a little water after to thin out my eye lashes to be less clumped but this formula doesn't even allow that because a little water completely unbinds the mascara from your lashes and just flakes off. Weird formula, never had anything like this before. I liked the brush because it seemed to allow you to get less mascara at a time but that is the opposite of what happened. Tossing it out.",
