        "comments": "This product was highly recommended to me by a family member.  I am a mature woman and was desperate because I found myself spending much too much time trying to recreate eyebrows that no longer existed - and trying to make them look natural was another challenge.  I started seeing an improvement within weeks of use, and I am now approaching the maximum improvement time of four months since I started this application back in July.  I certainly plan to continue with the maintenance schedule of the every-other-day application thereafter, as recommended.  My eyebrows grew in darker than I expected, but I can definitely live with that.  One point that I would like to make is to be careful where you buy this product.  My first purchase was made in an actual physical Ulta Beauty store.  After that I purchased online from an outside source because the price was enticing.  The product I purchased online did not last long at all (a couple of weeks, at most).  This is the point I'm trying to make:  the last purchase that I just made was from Ulta Beauty online, and, much to my surprise, I noticed that the product came covered in a plastic security wrap.  This wrap did not appear on the other online purchase that I made from the other (unnamed) source.  No wonder it didn't last because I now feel that it must have been a previously used product.  So, all of my future purchases of this product will be made directly through Ulta Beauty only.  I just felt that this point is well worth noting.  I found that one wand did not come close to lasting the full four-month period.  In all honesty, I probably did apply more product than needed during my once-a-day application.  Even so, I feel that there is no way that one wand could possibly last the full four months.  Other than that, I am extremely satisfied with this product and will continue to use it to maintain these results.",

        "comments": "There are many reviews with quick turnarounds, i.e. people who just started using this product and review it within several days/weeks, etc. I thought it might be helpful to provide feedback as someone who started using this product one year ago. Like many others, I experienced results rather quickly. In fact I was pretty stunned at how fast new brow hair was coming in. In areas where my brows might have been patchy, this product seemed to help initiate new growth, to achieve fullness. As the product states, it does seem to intensify a deeper/darker colored brow. The first six months in using GrandeBROW was great- though expensive, it worked, and fast. Around 6 months however I started to notice some significant differences in this \"new\" brow hair versus my old brow hair. The new brow hair felt very coarse, much more wirey and abrasive to the touch than my normal soft brows. The new brow hair also grew back in the shape of large letter \"C's\", making each hair stand in the middle where it arched, and giving an overall unusual appearance when looked at closely. The new brow hair also had a VERY, very short \"life span\", meaning within 6 months of using the product, hairs would easily fall out when using my Clarisonic face wash or simply scratching an itch, etc. The new brow hair felt, well, fake. It was growing back like small cable wires and had a shelf life of mere months. Of course this could be remedied by continuing to use the product, which I have in much smaller doses. While one full year in using the product has brought in plenty of new growth, it should be stated that in my experience, the hair that grows in is thick, c-shaped wires that fall out rather quickly.",
