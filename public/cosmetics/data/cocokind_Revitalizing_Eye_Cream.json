        "comments": "I get that Cocokind was trying to make this product stand out in the oversaturated beauty market, but the solution was fine...there was no need to add the metal part. In fact, the metal part could cause sagging under the eyes if used too harshly. The metal part created a tugging feeling even when it was gently glided under the eyes. I agree with the most critical review. The eye cream didn't bring about any dramatic results, but take this part of my review with a grain of salt because I work a high-stress job and have to get up really early on the weekdays. How I would use this product is I would just squeeze the eye cream onto the top of my ring finger then gently dab the solution on my under eyes. I completely ignored the metal part.",

        "comments": "I really appreciate the honesty of cocokind in their branding and advertising of their products and one thing they posted a lot about around the release of this eye cream was that there are a lot of things that are unchangeable about the eye area. For me, the bone structure of my face and the way shadows are cast always make my undereyes seem VERY dark even if I am well rested (this is really common among South and Central asians) and it is something I regularly have to remind myself, seeing the company remind people about it too is something I think is very important and I enjoyed seeing. Now, in terms of this cream. I get really dry patches of skin really often and never realized how dry the undereyes can get before I began reading about it on the cocokind socials, I used to use my matcha on the undereyes but decided to give this a try when it was released and I LOVE it. It has helped a lot with how makeup used to settle into the lines under my eyes, and now that I changed the makeup I use too it doesn't at all ! The metal tip feels so refreshing and helps sort of gently wake me up when I get ready in the morning, and it absorbs very nicely and a lot quicker than I expected. I have never really been one for eye creams because I didn't understand them and didn't notice differences previously, but the effectiveness of this product along with the information behind it from cocokind has done a lot in terms of learning about the skin in general, learning about MY skin, and meeting goals with my skin. I love it.",

        "comments": "this is a thick cream that when spread it feels nice under the eyes, and it has a metal tip which can be refreshing, but i am maybe one or two days from finishing my first purchase of this (will have to try really hard to squeeze the last drops at this point), and i haven't particularly noticed anything. i've used it morning and night and have noticed no difference in my dark circles or under eye hydration. i actually did enjoy having this in my skincare routine just because it feels nice to apply, and even though i was really interested in seeing how its ingredients would work, it didn't noticeably do anything after a month (and now i've reached the end of my bottle). it also has such a small amount of product in comparison to other eye cream from skincare brands that ulta carries, and for the same price, so i'll just try something else next.",
