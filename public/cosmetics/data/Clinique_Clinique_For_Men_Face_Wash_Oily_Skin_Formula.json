My pores are naturally very small and my skins not too prone to breaking out unless I'm eating lots of oily food or not drinking enough water. After the first use I loved this, it left my face matte and helped clear up a couple pimples i had at the time. A few days later however i noticed that my pores had gotten bigger so to give the product a fair chance i stopped using it to see if my pores would shrink again, in case it was a diet thing, and then go back to it. After about a week I started using the face wash again and not only did my pores get bigger again but, my skin had started to peel, and my skin was much more susceptible to breaking out ( I've watched a line of four huge pimples grow on my cheek overnight and my forehead get covered with smaller ones). This is my second Clinique oil control product that has completely flopped for me and I don't plan on buying another from them.",

My pores are naturally very small and my skins not too prone to breaking out unless I'm eating lots of oily food or not drinking enough water. After the first use I loved this, it left my face matte and helped clear up a couple pimples i had at the time. A few days later however i noticed that my pores had gotten bigger so to give the product a fair chance i stopped using it to see if my pores would shrink again, in case it was a diet thing, and then go back to it. After about a week I started using the face wash again and not only did my pores get bigger again but, my skin had started to peel, and my skin was much more susceptible to breaking out ( I've watched a line of four huge pimples grow on my cheek overnight and my forehead get covered with smaller ones). This is my second Clinique oil control product that has completely flopped for me and I don't plan on buying another from them.",
