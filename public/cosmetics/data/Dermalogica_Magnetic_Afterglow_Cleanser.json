However, I needed a slightly stronger cleanser for summer/post workout sweat so I picked this up on a whim. It smells fantastic and makes my skin look and feel fabulous. It effectively cleans off all of the days gunk and sweat, yet doesn't irritate or dry my skin. This cleanser is so pricey, but my goodness is it amazing.",

The texture is incredibly soft and creamy it feels luxurious on the skin and creates such a soothing experience, especially in the mornings. The scent is light and refreshing, which makes it a perfect pick-me-up to start the day. After using it, my skin feels clean but never stripped just soft, balanced, and deeply nourished. It really helps to calm any sensitivity or dryness I might have, and it leaves my skin feeling smooth, hydrated, and visibly more radiant. I've noticed that my makeup goes on so much better afterward because my skin is properly prepped.",

The creamy texture feels luxuriousâ€\"almost like a moisturizer rather than a typical cleanserâ€\"which makes washing my face feel like a self-care ritual. It glides beautifully on the skin and does a great job of cleansing without leaving it feeling stripped or tight. After rinsing, my skin feels incredibly soft and smooth, and I've noticed that my other skincare products apply more effortlessly afterward. That said, I haven't experienced the â€œafterglowâ€ effect that's advertised. While my skin feels nourished, it doesn't look particularly radiant or glowy right after cleansing. In fact, it looks a bit dull until I follow up with a moisturizer. I appreciate that it's gentle and non-drying, but I was hoping for a more visibly luminous finish post-cleanse. Overall, it's a lovely product for texture and hydration, but if you're looking for an immediate glow, this might fall a bit short. Gifted by dermalogica",

        "comments": "I received this product in exchange for honest review gifted by dermalogica! Honestly this product didn't seem to do much for me. The packaging design is nice and clean but the cap you push down to get the product out wobbles it's a little unstable. I like the consistency of the product and how a little goes a long way but my face (which is typically dry skin) didn't really feel different before and after. The smell is also okay, it's like a mixture of like a minty pine freshish smell? I can't pinpoint it. I like it it's just different. I probably wouldn't recommend as I didn't see much of a difference in my skin hydration or appearance after using for 2 weeks. It did get my makeup off though!",
