        "comments": "I have the MOST sensitive skin ever. Generally, I can only keep a 2-step skincare routine, as anything more breaks me out. In the morning, I rinse my face, neck and chest with water, pat dry, and apply an SPF that is also a great moisturizer. At night, I wash my face with Simple brand and apply La Roche Posay double repair moisturizer. However, after a round of probiotics caused an insane amount of greasy, painful breakouts on my face and down my neck, I needed to do something extra to help heal my skin. After research, I found that PHAs are safe for sensitive skin and helps with cell turnover to clear up the skin. I bought this toner specifically because it has PHAs. The hyaluronic acid is a nice bonus. I use this every night after I wash my face, BUT I dampen my face, neck, and chest before applying. This helps to reintroduce moisture in my skin and dilute the toner to make it easier for my skin to handle. I have noticed a huge improvement in the acne scars on my neck from the probiotic breakout, AND I am having very few breakouts on my face now! It took about 2 weeks to start making improvements, but my skin is looking better than it has in a long time. I'm optimistic that it will help me return my skin health to a balanced state.",

So far, this product has made my skin feel rejuvinated and hydrated from the usual dryness I experience. I haven't used a toner in a few years, so I'm hoping this will help exfoliate the dead skin off my face like the employee said it would. I just got the product yesterday and have only used it once, which is the reason I only gave it 4 stars. I will write another review in a couple weeks to see if its held up and I'll paste this review to the top of the new review.",

They popped up on my chin at a minimum of two times per month. And they hurt so bad! An esthetician recommended using this product, so I gave it a try. I had used everything from other high-end skincare acne lines to home remedies. I actually had a cystic acne spot on my chin the day I bought this product, so I decided to use it that night. Woke up the next morning and the spot was gone! I have been using for 2 weeks (I use this every other night & just on my \"acne\" areas) and have yet to have another cystic acne spot or any breakout since that date. I am in awe & so thankful!!!!",

While my skin did have a slight reaction when I first started using it, I wasn't surprised since I always have a reaction when I try something new. I am almost on my second bottle, I love how my skin feels throughout the day. It absorbs nicely. I have noticed my extremely oily skin is under control after using this for about a week in the AM and PM. By the end of the day my entire face would look wet from my oil production, before I added this toner. Now my cheeks have become normal and my nose and forehead still get a slight shine, but nothing I'm mad about. I actually like the slight shine. Very happy I went with this toner!",

The Ulta SA recommended me this one and I have been using it ever since. I have tried other toners here and there over the years, but I always find myself coming back to this one.  It is gentle, yet effective. It removes any leftover residue, surface oils that I wake up with, without drying the skin out. It has no overpowering scent and leaves my skin feeling fresh and hydrated. Plus it is Alcohol-free!",
