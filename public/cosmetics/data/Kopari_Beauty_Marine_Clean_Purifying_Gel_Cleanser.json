I've never used it alone without a cleansing balm to remove makeup so I can't say how well it works for that.\n\nThe only con I can see is that I do sometimes get a slight seaweed/kelp smell, it's not strong and makes sense with the 'marine' label but if you can't stand the smell of seaweed I'd avoid this.

It really is the best of a gel cleanser and foam combined. It's very gentle and cleanses without stripping my skin. I have combo skin, and wear very light makeup, but it does seem to do a good job of washing everything away. Can't speak to how it would work on full makeup, but it leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed. The smell took some getting used to...I couldn't place it initially, but it smells kinda like a green juice lol! If you know, you know, but it's not a bad thing, just not what I expected. I think it's the cucumber, but again not bad, just smells natural is all! It also doesn't linger, so don't let the scent throw you if it's not for you-just rinse and you won't even smell it anymore. Now that I've been using it consistently, I actually enjoy the scent. :) Another win for Kopari! Thanks for making great, natural products that actually do what they claim!",

        "comments": "I was super excited to try this face wash because I have their moisturizer and LOVE it. I have sensitive skin so I need natural products that don't irritate the skin and cause me to break out, which is why the consultant at Ulta recommended this face wash after I told her I was using the one from the PUR line. Anyway, after waiting a while because it was always out of stock, I gave it a whirl. The smell is funky, but not terrible. After just one week I started to break out with cystic acne that is currently taking forever to go away and starting to scar due to its size and being so inflamed. I used this wash for a whole month just to make sure I wasn't breaking out due to other factors, even though my skin is usually always clear… this product is NOT it for my sensitive skin/acne prone girlies. I just got my forever clean wash from PUR and will be continuing to use what works.",
