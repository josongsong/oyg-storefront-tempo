This did nothing to improve my concealer's appearance. My dark circles have lightened over time so I can't say the cream improved them. I liked the turquoise tube. It made it really hygienic & easy to get the proper dose. It tapped in easily w/no irritation. It didn't contribute to milia. I used a full tube but will not repurchase. I prefer Neutrogena's makeup remover products to their other skincare products.",

This did nothing for either issue after using half the tube consistantly. My concealers don't look fresh & lovely atop this Gel-Creme. I suppose a Pro is the amount you get. It took two months to use half the tube. I have no motivation to finish it or recommend it to anyone else. Perhaps someone w/out crow's feet & circles would appreciate it. I'm 41 & the lines popped up last year seemingly overnight. My circles have stayed w/me off & on since College. I've already returned to L'oreal Eye Defense. It actually works & costs roughly the same. You get both Hyaluronic Acid & Caffeine.",

I've had undereye \"bags\" since I was a child, which always made me look so tired. I was browsing through Ulta one day and saw this product on sale. I saw that it had hyaluronic acid in it (which is wonderful for the skin) so I figured that I'd try it. I have tried numerous eye creams from brands like Benefit, Clinique, Olay, Skyn, etc. You name it, I've bought it. My eyes are naturally deep set, so there's always a shadow. I can't help that and there will never be a cream that will get rid of that \"darkness\". However, this cream helped because it reduced the puffy bags and really hydrated my skin, which kinda \"brightened\" and lifted my tired eyes. My bags de-puffed overnight. It is crazy how this cream transformed my undereye area. I do keep this in the fridge just because the \"cooling\" effect is almost orgasmic. It is a staple in my morning and nighttime routine. Can't live without it. You need this cream if you haven't bought it yet.",
