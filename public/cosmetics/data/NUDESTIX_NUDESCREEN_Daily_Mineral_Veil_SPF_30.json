        "comments": "It took me 4 months to use up this entire tube and as soon as I neared the last week I ordered another bottle because I fell in love with this formula. I have oily skin and I struggle with finding formulas that work alone and with makeup. This is honestly the best sunscreen and primer I've used. I do four pumps, warm it up with my fingers and distribute all over my face. I use the lightest option which is a little cool toned - I have olive skin so it helps to even out where I have more purple and blue on my face. What makes this one of the best sunscreen primers is that I do half a pump more and spread on the area under my eyes and it brightens and corrects my under-eyes. I've been asked multiple times what I am wearing and most days it's a One Size primer and this sunscreen. And the great thing is that this lasts all day, only needs to be powdered a little bit when it's 80 degree and higher. If you have dry skin I would recommend using a hydrating skincare routine, maybe a milky toner and moisturizer before applying this, but it's a holy grail for oily skin.",

Despite the dark color it blended beautifully and easily. I look lightly sun kissed with a dewy finish. When it eventually dries down I get minimal transfer and it seems to be a good base for a no make up make up look. I also notice my skin looks really good after having used this product for a few weeks. The packaging is nice and works well to prevent waste.\n\nI'm fortunate that it works for my skin tone but could see how the limited range of shades may not work for everyone. That said, if it does work for your coloring its a fantastic product.",

Honestly since I have been in Canada I have tried using sunscreen products but to no avail they somehow are either really greasy or leave a white tint behind but I was pleasently surprised by the nudestix daily mineral veil and I absolutely loved it as I am a busy mom on the go I use it in place of my foundation it has great coverage so light that you don't know it's there a little greasy at first but it absorbs well and then you don't even realize it's there. \n\nThank-you @influenster and @nudestix for this product which I will definitely be buying and recommending it anyone who wants to know. #GONUDEBUTBETTER #freeproductreview #influenster",

        "comments": "I received this product for free from the BzzAgent sampling program. \n\nThere's a lot that I like about this sunscreen! The texture is smooth, so it's really easy to apply, and it doesn't become greasy throughout the day. I also felt like it did a good job as a primer, as it seemed to blur my pores and smooth the appearance of my skin's uneven texture. I felt like I could just wear the sunscreen by itself without needing to apply foundation and powder on top of it. \n\nThe container that holds the sunscreen is a light beige color, so at first I was a bit concerned that this sunscreen would give my skin a beige tint, similar to a liquid foundation. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this sunscreen doesn't do that (it actually has a white-ish color, like most typical sunscreens). It does leave a slight white-cast on my skin, but it's not noticeable enough to be an issue for me.\n\nThe packaging says that this sunscreen also acts as a \"daily hydrating moisturizer,\" but to be honest, I didn't really notice much of a moisturizing effect. Perhaps that's because the weather has been quite cold lately, so my skin has been extra dry. As such, I personally found it better to apply a separate moisturizer before applying this sunscreen.\n\nFragrance-wise, I would say that this sunscreen has a very slight herbal/medicinal scent. I wouldn't say I like the scent, but it's not straight-up bad either. I appreciate how mild the scent is, and I think it could be a good option for people who are sensitive to fragrances.\n\nFinally, I like how this sunscreen is reef-safe and made with vegan ingredients. And the box that the sunscreen came in is apparently biodegradable, which is awesome! All in all, I'd definitely recommend this product to anyone who's looking for a great sunscreen that doubles as an effective makeup primer.",

        "comments": "I received this product for free from BzzAgent in exchange for an honest review. \nI have fair, oily, acne-prone skin, so when I first pumped out some of the product, I was pretty scared by how dark the Nude shade is. But once I fully applied it to my skin, it seemed to be a decent match. If anything, it gave me a slight bronzed tint. I think it definitely gives my skin a healthy glow. The package says that it's an all-in-one product -- lotion, SPF, skin tint, but I found that this wasn't hydrating enough even for my oily skin. My skin felt a bit tight after a few hours. I also found that it didn't provide a lot of coverage. I think this would be great on a good skin day where you want it to even things out, but if you're expecting this to cover healing blemishes, it won't do that for you. I've been using this for a few weeks because I wanted to see if it'd clog my pores, and I'm really happy that it doesn't, which can be a problem for me when it comes to SPFs. Overall, I wouldn't purchase this SPF. It's fine, but it isn't hydrating enough, and I expect more coverage for a product in this price range.",
