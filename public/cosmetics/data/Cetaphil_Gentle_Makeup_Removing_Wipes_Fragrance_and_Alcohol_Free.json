About half way through them, they started drying out and then they pretty much stopped being able to remove a lot of makeup.  But that's not the worst thing.  I used these for about 3 months.  Over the course of those 3 months, my face started turning really red (like I had rosacea), it got super dry (way more than normal).  I don't really get zits, but they started randomly popping up.  My pores got HUGE and my cheeks actually looked kind of puffy.  I honestly thought something was really wrong with me and I needed to see a dermatologist.  They were the only new product I introduced into my routine.  I stopped using them and 3 days later, there was so much less redness and dryness you have no idea.  I don't know if it's the citric acid that's in these things (why they'd put that in a sensitive skin brand I don't know) or some other ingredient, whatever is in these things destroyed my face and now I'm slowly getting better.  Seriously, just don't buy these if you have dry sensitive skin.",

About half way through them, they started drying out and then they pretty much stopped being able to remove a lot of makeup.  But that's not the worst thing.  I used these for about 3 months.  Over the course of those 3 months, my face started turning really red (like I had rosacea), it got super dry (way more than normal).  I don't really get zits, but they started randomly popping up.  My pores got HUGE and my cheeks actually looked kind of puffy.  I honestly thought something was really wrong with me and I needed to see a dermatologist.  They were the only new product I introduced into my routine.  I stopped using them and 3 days later, there was so much less redness and dryness you have no idea.  I don't know if it's the citric acid that's in these things (why they'd put that in a sensitive skin brand I don't know) or some other ingredient, whatever is in these things destroyed my face and now I'm slowly getting better.  Seriously, just don't buy these if you have dry sensitive skin.",
