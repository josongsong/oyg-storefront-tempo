Not only did I get a MASSIVE pimple right on the bottom corner of my lip but I got a big black head just above ny top lip as well! This has left me devastated and that pimple is stubborn and painful!

Like I had to really think about how to get the gloss on without 1) getting outside my lipline  2) getting enough to come off the applicator, or the opposite of a glob coming off in the wrong place. I love the color so much I will keep it; jury is out on if I would purchase it again.",

However, I am not acne prone at all I get a pimple or a black head every few months but this lip product created a crime scene on my lips. Not only did I get a MASSIVE pimple right on the bottom corner of my lip but I got a big black head just above ny top lip as well! This has left me devastated and that pimple is stubborn and painful! I think that not only acne prone people should be aware of this product and its comedogenic ingredients but even people who are not acne prone need to be very careful when applying this product.",
