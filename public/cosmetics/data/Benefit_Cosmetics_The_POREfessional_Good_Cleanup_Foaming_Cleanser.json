I got a dry spot around my nose after about 2 weeks of use, didn't connect it was the cleanser because I changed some makeup and moisturizer as well. My skin started to get red and scaly all around my nose and mouth to the point I thought somehow I'd developed psoriasis or something. Then the red, itchy scaly skin started appearing around my eyes. I have been changing each part of my skincare routine one at a time trying to find the cause. Finally chucked this cleanser and within 3 days my skin is looking healthier but still a lot of damage to undo. DEFINITELY wouldn't recommend for anybody with sensitive skin.",

If you pair this with the Get Unblocked oil makeup remover (if you wear makeup) and the deep retreat clay mask, your skin will thank you. My skin has never felt so soft from just washing it. The blackheads around my nose have diminished and my pores were definitely reduced. If blackheads or large pores are a concern for you, I'd definitely recommend this product. Honestly, I recommend this product even if you don't have those concerns. This is just a great cleanser overall. This is a very lightweight and gentle cleanser too and it gives you the amount you need when you pump it so you aren't over using product. Also, per the Benefit Cosmetics website, this is for all skin types (including sensitive). All in all, if you're looking to try a new cleanser out, I'd highly recommend trying this one.",
