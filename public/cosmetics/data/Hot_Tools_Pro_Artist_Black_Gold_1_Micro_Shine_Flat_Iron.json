I have fine, already straight hair so mainly used for soft waves, flips, and fringe.\nIron randomly stopped working after a year. It would not turn on, or if I was able to turn on for a few seconds, it shut itself off. It was not used daily, so sat more than used. Was not impressed from the get go, but gave it a shot.",

I bought this because of the sale and wanted a flat iron with adjustable settings! I never need it above 300 and it's perfect for my hair! Super easy to straighten and curl but I will say the curls don't last as long as when I curl with my curling iron so something to keep in mind. \nI don't use it often maybe 1-2x a month if that! But it has lasted with no issues! Definitely recommend if you're thinking of a new flat iron!",

It turns on super easily and heats up super fast (about 30 seconds or less). It also has a small screen to allow you to easily see the exact temperature it is set to. You can change the temperature with the barrel at the bottom of the straightener which is super simple and becuase it's not a button on the top it prevents you from accidentally changing the temperature at any time. I also love the floating plates. They allow for super smooth straightening. I can use this straightener at a lower temperature than I previously used which means I'm damaging my hair less. Also, after straightening my hair is so glossy and soft. I have hair that is on the straighter side (some ends cuve in and other parts of my hair like to go in many different directions), but I think this straightener would probably also work well for someone with wavier or curlier hair. The only thing I don't like about this straightener is that the mini screen on the straigthener will have the word off flashing when it's turned off and plugged in. The only way to make the flashing word to go away is if the device is unplugged which is a little annoying, but it's not really a problem with the device.",

        "comments": "For starters, I have fine color treated hair with highlights, so i am very cautious with heat products and I use a leave in spray, hair oil and a heat protector and I never have an issue with frizz. This straightener was terrible! it snagged all through my hair. It did not matter if I used a brush or a comb. As others do, I read lots of reviews before making my purchase. Most Ultas around SD were sold out of this product, so it must be good right? The Chi for Ulta, which is cheaper, was the device I had before this one, works much better than this product. There is a review below (a lengthy one) that helped seal the deal to purchase this. I like Hot Tools curling irons, so I had high hopes for this one, but it ultimately disappointed. The pro to this device is it heats up really fast and the digital turn dial is pretty cool. The straightner is light and has a sleek body, but Hot Tools needs to improve the smoothness of the iron plates.",
