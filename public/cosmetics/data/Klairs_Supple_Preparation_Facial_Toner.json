This has a thicker texture, not thick but not just liquid like most toners. It feels more substantial than a liquid toner and like the product goes further. I feel like this is so moisturizing too! I'll put it on and sometimes almost forget that I haven't finished my routine bc it just feels really nice. I'll be making this a permanent part of my routine.",

        "comments": "I rarely rebuy products and almost never stick to a single brand or product long-term. I love trying new products and always have exacting standards so I'm always seeking the next best thing. I use the Korean 7-Step Method morning and night and have been seeking a really hydrating toner. I bought this one to reach an order minimum but wasn't super hopeful because I feel meh about some of Klairs other products. However, I instantly fell in love with this toner! It's a good light-medium consistency so rather than being watery or creamy, it's somewhere in between. It instantly hydrates my skin and sinks in without sitting on my skin surface. Especially as the winter months have been especially dry this year, this toner has helped tremendously in hydrating my skin to prevent dryness and peeling. As added bonuses, this toner is affordable and cruelty-free, which are both requirements for me to purchase a product. I have combination to dry skin and do get the occasional breakout from a new product but haven't had any breakout issues with this product. It is gentle and does not burn, sting, or have a strong smell. I don't think this toner is comparable to any other toner that I have tried and I plan to permanently incorporate it into my routine, though I'm unsure if I will do so as a day or night or seasonal-only toner. Highly recommend!",

The texture is like a cross between that of a hyaluronic acid serum and a regular hydrating toner. I use another toner with either glycolic acid or witch hazel to remove excess dirt and makeup around the perimeter of my face after I second cleanse, then I pat this on using just my hands. About 3 drops is all I need for my whole face. A little goes a long way. \n\nIt's just a simple, very nice toner to apply. It almost feels cooling as it goes on. The scent is lovely; gentle, soothing and spa-like. I may have never discovered it had it not been for Ulta's 21 Days of Beauty. Very happy to have come upon it. It is now a staple product in my routine. Great price for the quality of the product, imo. I love the dark bottle and the label as well. The whole user experience is just A+.",

        "comments": "I'm almost ashamed to admit that I've been stockpiling this. Also, I have it in various sizes - 180ml bottles, 30ml bottles, 3ml bottles. Basically I am able to bring with me wherever I go so that I never have to be without it. I even use it on my body because I've got really dry skin sometimes. I'm so uncomfortable with not using this that I feel as though I'm going to get a breakout if I use a different toner? Must be some warped psychological effect. I've used various toners before and none of them made me feel like something is happening. Most toner simply feel like overpriced water to me. Some are overly perfumed chemical smelling water, which I absolutely hate. Then I had the chance to try out this from one of the samples I received. This smells so organic and fragrance free. The texture is slightly more tacky than water but still viscous enough to be absorbed easily. I fell in love. As this toner feels so good, I don't even care about the cleansers I use anymore because I figured that any drugstore cleanser works since I'm going to be slapping this on immediately and it would adjust the pH level of my skin to a healthy range. This toner is mild, non-irritating, does not break me out. It is so mild that when it gets into my eye area, it doesn't not sting my tear ducts. In fact, I think a little entered my eyes just now when I used it, but I didn't feel anything. Either this has a numbing agent or it is simply very mild. So given how mild it is, this doesn't do anything to cure acne, FYI so don't be counting on that. This also doesn't minimise your pores. What this does really well is make your skin feel relieved and well moisturised after a thorough cleansing. I kind of noticed that the fine lines on my forehead seem to have reduced ever since I started using this toner. My forehead tends to be extremely dry and wrinkly. Now, it is more plumped and makeup no longer goes on patchy. I'm able to pull a better heist in conning people into thinking that I have stunning complexion. Regarding my method of application, I like to pour it into my palm and pat it in for half a minute. I don't see the value in using a cotton pad because I'm pretty good at cleansing my face and generally will not have leftover dirt or soap on my face after cleaning. So I feel that a cotton pad may be a waste of perfectly good toner. It's absorbing toner away from my skin. If there's one item you want to try from Klairs, it has to be this. I never cared for toners until I started using this.",

I don't have any issue with the scent or the essential oils and I have pretty sensitive skin and I am usually not a fan of essential oils but this doesn't irritate me at all. It isn't as hydrating as I would like but would be fine for normal skin or someone who isn't looking for hydration in their toner. I just use this after my acid toner then layer a moisturizing serum over it or maybe a hyaluronic acid over. I don't find it to be sticky, it sinks in to my skin nicely. I wish Ulta would not discontinue so many of the dear klairs products (rich moist soothing cream and the midnight blue calming cream are both amazing). It is so much more convenient to order from Ulta than from Hong Kong but if Ulta won't carry Korean skincare I have no other choice.",
