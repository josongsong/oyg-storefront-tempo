Also it smells just like vegetable oil. I was so disturbed how I smelled with this lotion because I felt like an oiled up pig or something about to be deep fried. Do not recommend.",

I began having melanoma problems 35 years ago, and I have been seeing a dermatologist regularly since then.  I live in California now, and use SPF 40 sunscreen.  On my last dermatology visit, the doctor recommended I begin using a moisturizer, and apply it all over my body twice daily.  I had never used anything like this, and asked for a reference.  My doctor recommended La Roche-Posay.  I purchased a bottle, began trying it, and discovered it was easy and quick to apply.  The first day I began receiving compliments on my \"glowing fresh\" look.   These compliments have continued.    My wife says my skin is much smoother.  I look forward to my doctor's comments on my next visit.   Thank you for developing a product to help \"first timers\" like me.",

For the price I paid for one bottle, you would think this company could provide a pump that would actually work with the thickness of the lotion.  I tried to attach a picture that displays the amount of product that was left in the bottle however they will not allow me to attach it to this review.  I'll try to add another review on google to see if I can add this information.  have to cut the bottle in half with a box cutter and scoop out the remaining lotion with a spatula in order to use it.",
