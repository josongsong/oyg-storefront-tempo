I washed my eye makeup well, rised and when I looked up my face was covered in smeared black mascara! Even foundation residue was left on my face. I had to use a different face wash to get my face clean. \nMaybe it works for a no makeup girl but not for me. They need to stop calling this a makeup remover!!",

I wet my face first to loosen the mascara and then I rubbed some on my eyes. I barely use foundation or other makeup on my skin so this product met my needs. It doesn't dry your skin or irritate it. I have super sensitive skin and most cleansers are too drying for me. If you wear makeup daily I'd suggest their stronger cleanser. If your someone who rarely uses makeup then this cleanser is for you.",

I also love the variety of ways it can be used:  as a regular cleanser, as a moisturizing mask-- rub it into your skin and let it sit for 20-30 minutes before wiping or cleansing it off, and if you run out of moisturizer or just need something a little heavier you can use it as a moisturizer after wiping off the excess!  \n\nIt doesn't do so well for removing makeup, but it loosens face and eye makeup before you go to wash your face and remove your eye makeup.  Or if you have on light eye makeup, it WILL remove it.  This stuff is just absolutely a staple in my skincare.",

I no longer break out, don't have any redness or dry patches.  \n\nSome have commented that it doesn't remove make-up, specifically eye make-up.  I use a little dab to remove my eye make-up first and gently pat off with a tissue.  Then, I use a dime-sized amount to cleanse my face.  I then rinse off with water. Works fine for me.",

I began with this cleanser, then added the thermal spring water, Redermic C eyes and Redermic C UV during the day and Redermic R at night.  What a difference in my skin.  I no longer break out, don't have any redness or dry patches.  \n\nSome have commented that it doesn't remove make-up, specifically eye make-up.  I use a little dab to remove my eye make-up first and gently pat off with a tissue.  Then, I use a dime-sized amount to cleanse my face.  I then rinse off with water. Works fine for me.",

My skin did not feel clean after using, especially if I didn't rinse. However, I did like using it as a barrier on my skin. It does not moisturize, at least not as far as I could tell, but put on already moisturized, dried, skin it seemed to act as a good moisture barrier. When used in this way, I noticed that my face didn't get drier in certain situations where it normally does. Honestly, I don't think it's worth it to buy a whole product just for that one thing. I'd rather just put on extra moisturizer.",
