The 2 stars I took off is because  after about half way through the liner breaks, I try to put it back in but it's pointless because it smudges every where, my fingers the bathroom counter/sink.  I don't mind paying the price because it is good high end liner. But it's not worth the price if I can't use the whole product. Fix that and I will try it out again.

Some of the product gets in my eye/under-eye area which is somewhat irritating. I like using this now but not sure if I would buy again due to the product flaking off. \n\nI've noticed this issue with other Clinique cosmetic products. I love the Pop Lip+Cheek Oil but this really dries my lips out. The color is great but the application sometimes falls short. I recently purchased the Lip+Cheek Oil but have gone through so much of it already because it dries out within minutes of application. If Clinique managed to fix this issue I would only buy from them! Colors of the Black Honey line are still wonderful.",

        "comments": "Honestly wish I didn't have to give such a bad rating but my experience has been nothing but poor with this product. I was excited to try as it is advertised specifically to be waterline safe. I bought this yesterday and immediately opened it to put it on. It is extremely difficult to go on my waterline even after drying my waterline with a tissue. After that it does not go on smoothly, heavy in some places and tiny clumps sometimes and other places just smeared where you can still see the skin through.\n\nFurthermore, it irritates the crap out of my eyes. I know it is not supposed to go in your eye but due to the aforementioned tiny clumps, it is hard not to get it in the eye. Just it being on my waterline is bothersome as well. I am a contacts wearer but these are all things this product has claimed to be safe for. I am extremely disappointed as the price is steep compared to the cheap drug store brand that has never given me an issue.\n\nLastly am I doing something wrong because this thing won't roll up. I am just rotating the bottom several times and it never comes up. I accept that this could be user error. I will continue to give this product a chance and change my rating if warranted so if this is still here then it still stands. I also hate that a dark brown color is \"limited edition\". I'm old, I need dark brown liner.",

        "comments": "Clinique's Black Honey Eyeliner Pen is a standout product that promises to deliver both versatility and quality in one sleek package. \nOne of the first things you notice about this eyeliner is its packaging. The pen itself is designed with a modern, ergonomic shape that fits comfortably in your hand, making precise application a breeze. The sleek black design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also practical, as it ensures the pen doesn't roll off surfaces when not in use.\n\nMoving on to the formula, the Black Honey Eyeliner Pen boasts a rich, pigmented color that truly lives up to its name. The shade \"Black Honey\" is unique in that it's not a stark black but rather a deep, warm brown with subtle hints of plum undertones. This makes it incredibly versatile, suitable for both everyday wear and more dramatic evening looks. The color payoff is impressive with just one swipe, and it can easily be built up for a more intense finish without becoming patchy or uneven.\n\nThe texture of the eyeliner is smooth and creamy, allowing for effortless application. Whether you prefer a thin, precise line or a bold cat-eye, the fine tip of the pen glides effortlessly along the lash line, giving you full control over your desired look. The formula sets relatively quickly but gives you just enough time to perfect your application before it dries down to a smudge-proof finish.\n\nSpeaking of longevity, the longevity is not that great. I noticed it faded off about 4-5 hours into wear. I'm really picky about that so that's why it's 4/5 instead of a 5/5!",

        "comments": "Honestly wish I didn't have to give such a bad rating but my experience has been nothing but poor with this product. I was excited to try as it is advertised specifically to be waterline safe. I bought this yesterday and immediately opened it to put it on. It is extremely difficult to go on my waterline even after drying my waterline with a tissue. After that it does not go on smoothly, heavy in some places and tiny clumps sometimes and other places just smeared where you can still see the skin through.\n\nFurthermore, it irritates the crap out of my eyes. I know it is not supposed to go in your eye but due to the aforementioned tiny clumps, it is hard not to get it in the eye. Just it being on my waterline is bothersome as well. I am a contacts wearer but these are all things this product has claimed to be safe for. I am extremely disappointed as the price is steep compared to the cheap drug store brand that has never given me an issue.\n\nLastly am I doing something wrong because this thing won't roll up. I am just rotating the bottom several times and it never comes up. I accept that this could be user error. I will continue to give this product a chance and change my rating if warranted so if this is still here then it still stands. I also hate that a dark brown color is \"limited edition\". I'm old, I need dark brown liner.",
