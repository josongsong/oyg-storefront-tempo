The color payoff is great and can be applied lightly for a faint, natural looking flush or  layered on for greater depth and intensity. I've seen this blush look great on light  to medium-dark skin tones. Definitely a great purchase. It's unfortunate that Lancome seems to have discontinued their more intense blushes. I have many of them and they all still perform well after many years. Lancome, please consider bringing back your darker blushes!",
