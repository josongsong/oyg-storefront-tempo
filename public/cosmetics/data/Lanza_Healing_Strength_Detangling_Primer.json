I noticed an immediate difference after my first use. It left my hair so soft, shiny and not tangly. I never air dry my hair but I was running late to work one morning and used this before putting my hair in a braid. I can't wait to use this again next wash and heat style. I can only imagine it's going to look and feel even better. Will be buying the full size once I run out & explore other products in this healing strength line.

I have naturally curly/wavy, frizzy hair and sensitive skin and have had a hard time finding a detangler that reduces breakage, leaves hair feeling soft and doesn't clog the pores on my scalp.  Just a few sprays of this detangler and I can easily comb through my hair, haven't had a clogged pore since I started using it and my hair feels nice and soft.  It also has a nice, light subtle scent that is not overpowering.  It also comes in a travel size so I can take it wherever I go!  Although it is pricy, it is definitely worth the money, the bottle will last a long time and Ulta offers coupon codes for $10 off that can be used on prestige brands and combines with using reward points to reduce the price.  This is now the only detangler I need and use...hopefully L'anza will never change the formula!",
