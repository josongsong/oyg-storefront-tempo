        "comments": "This is a new cleanser from Lancome and it seems to be aimed to brighten skin a refine pores. I noticed it mentioned it is for all skin types. My skin type is normal but HYPERsensitive. While it has fragrance it is not harsh. It is a green scent, not like grass but it smells like a plant (perhaps the beech extract). You only need a small amount for a generous foam. It doesn't burn the eyes or leave my face feeling tight. I do wish Lancome would make more unscented products (especially genefique!). I see a difference in my skin after using it for a week! Its a big bottle and should last a long time.",
