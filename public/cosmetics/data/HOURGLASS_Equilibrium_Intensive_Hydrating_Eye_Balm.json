        "comments": "I tried this eye balm after it was recommended by a popular makeup artist. I absolutely love it. Yeah its pricey but this jar will last forever - quality and quantity. I use the tiniest dab under each eye every night - like touch my ring finger onto the surface of the product and that picks up enough for one eye. It has the consistency of a thick ointment like aquaphor so you dont want to use too much. This is the only eye product I've ever used that actually hydrates my undereye area and helps reduce the look of wrinkles as a result. If youre on the fence, just get it!",

Feels like petroleum jelly, which would have been way less expensive. Sadly at this time I cannot return item due to the time I've given this product to prove me wrong.",
