I already have decently plump lips as it is so I wasn't buying this for the plumping effect, but I do think it makes lips look nice and has a slight plumping effect. It doesn't sting either.

Very glossy, easy to apply. I have since purchased Jam and love it! Great color.\nwill definitely buy more!!",

Personally i love it and in comparisoj to other high end brands i dont think yiu can beat it. I received the shade ballet and its defiitely a cool toned pink a little sheer but you can see that pjnk color. Love love love will be purchasing almost the rest of the collection",

Feel so hydrating on the lips when I apply, but also makes my lips look fuller and plumper. No stinging! I LOVE that over time the ingredients in these makes your lips look softer, fuller and more plumper. That was my main reason for purchasing because I do not want lip fillers and prefer natural aging. I am 36 years old and these are perfect for me; they are sleek and slender and I can throw them in my makeup bag, my purse, my small Gucci or my gym bag for a touch up. I just low how the application looks initially though; such a beautiful gloss finish. Milani kills the lip game and of course, you can't beat the price point. Love you Milani for affordable AND luxury cosmetics!",

        "comments": "This is a nice lipgloss. The color is beautiful, and it's easy to handle and apply. Instead of pushing a button like other cream lipgloss plumpers, you twist the bottom to move the color up. You can see it move up easier than others so you know how much product you are using.\nWhile I love the color and will continue to use this product, I didn't notice any lip plumping or even the tingling you normally get from those types of products. At first I thought it was because I used a heavy lip treatment before using the gloss. The next use I didn't have the treatment and still didn't notice anything.",
