It definitely provides a matte finish and smoothing effect. I've worn it on long days and it holds up so well, even in heat and humidity. No flashback in photos either, which is a huge win.

So when I received it from free in exchange for my honest opinion, I was very excited. I do have a favorite setting powder of mine from another brand, so I didn't really look for a new one but this one caught my attention. The packaging is compact and slim, not any different from majority of loose setting powders from other brands, which is great if you wanna carry it in your purse. However, since it doesn't come with any applicator, you need a brush or a makeup sponge on hand if you do your makeup outside your home. I mostly do it at home, so it's not a big issue for me. It's not heavily scented, which is a huge plus for me. Overall, it sits pretty well on my tinted moisturizer and doesn't cake. I don't apply setting powder in the creases though, like under eyes for example, to avoid the caking effect, so the powder really works for my skin. Glad I got to try it as it's definitely something I will purchase in the future, especially considering it's about double or even triple cheaper than the brand I've been using for a while.",

I got the translucent and the light pink one thing I noticed upon application was my forhead had a shiny patch so I decided to test the powder on my palm and in fact it has a shiny pearl like finish to it which.. ew. It didn't last 5min and my skin was sooo shiny. It did NOTHING for my oils. It excentuated pores due to the pearl like finish also I feel like it is too fine to even set tou have to use half the dang thing in one go and for the price you don't get alot of product and speaking of product the pores it comes out of are so terrible I have to slam it to get product out and so little powder comes out at a time. If you're going for shiny no makeup makeup and you have normal to dry skin this is for you.",
