        "comments": "Hopping on her becasue I see this hasn't been reveiwed by anyone yet, which shocks me. \nThis is a thick and foamy facewash that actually feels like it absorbs into your skin and treats it. After rinsing it off, my skin is super soft and supple feeling and I notice my redness is noticiably reduced after my face calms down from the wash. I used this to get my face ready for my wedding, followed by Kate Sommerville's ExfoliKate Glow Moisturizer and it seemed to be the dynamic duo that I was looking for. I have red, acne prone / roscea skin and this seriously helped keep everytnig calm. \n\nSide note: my bridesmaid borrowed this and the ExfoliKate Moisturizer for 2 nights, and she doesn't have acne prone or red skin, but she also LOVED how it felt.",
