        "comments": "This cleanser is a great first step for double cleansing. It removes makeup and surface debris well. Not drying, not irritating. Wouldn't use as a standalone cleanser or second cleanse, but that's okay! That's not really what it's for! Only downside is that it does really sting your eyes when removing eye makeup.",
