LOVE IT!!  Im 66 yoa and have good skin for my age but depending on weather/time of year/other factors my face is sometimes drier than at other times. This cream has beautiful texture, really moisturizes my skin but isn't too much or too heavy.  Some reviews said it was greasy...I didn't this so.  I was looking for a slightly heavier moisturizer than my usual favorite.  This left a nice moist feel to my face and once dry, my makeup went on beautifully. I couldn't be happier with this purchase, a beautiful product.",

Milk RX is a doctor-formulated, dermatologist-approved multilayer moisturizer that's 4x more effective than retinol with zero irritation. This rich cream helps to lift, firm, and increase collagen production up to 31% for a visibly thicker epidermis and a reduction in some of the most common signs of aging. Goat milk blend and reinvented it into a proprietary better aging complex, Renexosome™, which contains reneseed and milk protein exosomes, and is clinically proven to increase the lifespan of skin. With a very light goat milk scent! It is in butter like with a thick and smooth cream texture. Like buncy cream texture feel! But it doesn't feel heavy at all, very easy to apply all over, melt into the skin, not greasy! After it absorbed, my skin feels so soft, moisturized, not oily! My skin feeling soft and nourished. Improve skin's visibly lifted and firmness! Deep hydrating & moisturizes skin! So comfortable! So moisturizing and nourishing to the skin! I can feel my skin is glowing and plump the next morning. Great for any skin types! Doctor formulated; Dermatologist tested. Safe for sensitive skin! Love it! Recommended!",

It's two guys who have a farm in upstate New York, took in some goats and started making goat milk then branched out to other products.\nI feel good about using these products, knowing they are cruelty free, sustainable, and clean. I used this product, exactly as directed, applying a dime size amount, morning, and evening for about three weeks. I am not usually very good at being consistent with my skin care routine, but I actually looked forward to putting this on my face in the morning and evening - it has such a nice texture and clean scent. The formula is rich yet lightweight, and absorbs effortlessly into my skin without any greasy residue. Final lines have softened, and my complexion has a radiant, youthful glow. My sensitive skin has responded well to it with no irritation or breakouts I've tried many Anti-aging products over the years, but this one has truly exceeded my expectations. If you're looking for a cream that delivers incredible results and feels like a little luxury in a jar, Beekman 1802 advanced better aging cream it's is a must try. It's worth every penny. I did receive this free as a sample, but would gladly purchase the product. They are reasonably priced and a good value for the money.",

It has the feeling of when you apply Vaseline to the skin, its not unpleasant by any means, but if you don't like the feeling of having something on your face that doesn't absorb completely, you may not enjoy the texture. As far as the firming claims, Its hard to say as I have not experienced it yet, but it may have the potential to do so with prolonged use. Overall id say that as a moisturizer, this does the trick, and seems like will lock in moisture all day.",
