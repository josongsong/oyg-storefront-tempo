When it became more common for skincare companies to include various chemical exfoliants in face washes, moisturizers, and masks without explicitly stating which ones, this face wash was a great, neutral option that didn't clash with other products and cause chemical burns. It also removes makeup better than some face washes specifically marketed for makeup removal!",

        "comments": "This has become my go-to facial cleanser which I come back to no matter what other products I try. A small amount builds into a luxurious creamy foam lather that feels so soothing. I have extremely sensitive skin but this does not irritate it one bit and my face feels so soft, smooth, clean after rinsing, with no tightness, dry patches or flakes that other cleansers often give me. I've also noticed it calms down my redness slightly. The tube lasts ages because of the tiny amount you need - honestly if you're using more than a pea size it's too much. The scent is mild but very pleasant; it doesn't smell like Yoghurt like the Korres Superdose face mask if you're wondering. For me this is worth purchasing full price because my skin adores it.",

The reason im giving it 5 instead of 4 stars is because the only problem i have is my face is a lil tight n dry after the wash , but nun a lil moisturizer cant fix and besides ur supposed to use moisturizer anyways ! I feel like this definitely removes my makeup even tho i use mid natural makeup nun too heavy . I also pair this with a face glove and works perfect .",

I always give a new product two months to give my skin time to get used to the product before deciding to discontinue. It has now been four months and I am in LOVE. The consistency is just like greek yogurt but its light and refreshing. My face is no longer is dull, its not stripped of its moisture, it is supple, and I feel clean and ready for the rest of my skin care routine. I recommend washing your face with cool/cold water with this product. I feel it works better and it soothes my skin at the same time ;) Especially To all my dark skin girlies, give this product a shot!",

Because it can take some time for our skin to adjust to a new product, i continued to use but it just kept getting worse. After a month of this product, when i took it out of my routine my skin started clearing up. This is an expensive product that is definitely a risk if you have sensitive skin.",

        "comments": "This facial cleanser is AMAZING for my sensitive dry skin. To be honest, I didn't have high hope about this product at first but I'm surprised by how my skin looks after washing this off my face. You know those dry fine lines you get when you smile after you wash a facial wash of your face? That's not what happens with this face wash. For that reason, this has been my go-to facial wash for the dry climates. This creamy-but-not-greasy texture is what you get when you squeeze the product put of the tube. The rest of of the step is your basic lather-and-rinse. Formulated with Greek Yoghurt as the star ingredient, it nourishes the skin as it cleanses it. But the best part of it all is it is SOAP-FREE. I proved it by lathering it all over my eyelids and it did NOT sting at all. Keep in mind that I only tried this as a facial wash, not as a makeup remover. I'm a double-cleanse believer and so I would use a cleansing oil or balm before I clean my face with facial wash the second time. That being said, it is a very good facial cleanser and worth it for the price point of $26 for a 150 mL of product. The product itself has this curdled milk kinda scent, but it's something I'm used to since I use Amlactin lotion that has a similar scent to it (soo moisturizing and nourishing and it has lactic acid that gently exfoliate your skin btw). That might be something to think about though if you're into nice-smelling stuff. For me, the efficacy of the product towers the scent so I give this :star:Ô∏è:star:Ô∏è:star:Ô∏è:star:Ô∏è and a half since the scent isn't too overpowering either. *Disclaimer: I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.",

        "comments": "I received this product complimentary from Influenster and to be 100% honest, I wasn't impressed by this product. BUT, I also wasn't completely disappointed. Firstly, I'm not one to regularly sit at the sink and wash my face every night so just the directions alone (‚ÄúRub gently into wet skin and rinse off with plenty of water.‚Äù) created a huge mess from me trying wash my face not in the shower. Water. Everywhere. Pro tip: use this in the shower. Things I liked; the fact that this product is soap free. I have somewhat dry skin, and soap tends to make it worse. It also has 86.4% natural ingredients in the product, which means less chemicals in your daily life. Win. I also found the idea of a Greek yoghurt face cleanser very intriguing and was wondering just how it would be to use. Unfortunately for me, I didn't really notice a difference between using this and one of my other face cleansers. The creme was lightly scented and pleasant to put on my face, but when I rinsed it off and sat for a bit my skin felt papery and tight. I was hoping that the Greek yoghurt would be lightly moisturizing. All in all, it's not terrible or even close to it, but it also didn't stand out.",
