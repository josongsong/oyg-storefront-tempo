I asked for a shade match in stores because I have fair, olive skin and finding foundation that actually matches my skin tone is very difficult. I thought they got pretty close, but in natural light, it was way too pink. I found it too heavy on my skin and an almost pasty texture. I have very dry skin and even with good skin prep, it highlighted every dry area and would look patchy. Unfortunately this will be a return.",

Since I started wearing it, I've gotten so many compliments on my skin this foundation gives a fresh look without feeling heavy. 💕 I do pair it with a really good hydrating primer. The coverage is surprisingly good, I still use concealer for spots that need it. \n\nThe finish is beautiful!!! So smooth and natural looking. The only thing I wish is that it came with a pump instead of a squeeze bottle, but honestly, I love it so much that I don't even mind.\n\nA friend recommended it to me, and I'm so glad she did! Will definitely repurchase. 💗",

As a pale person, the light shades pull/oxidizes yellow no matter if you buy a shade said to be cool toned. I've also seen othet people say they're darker shades are too great but I can't comment on that. Too much can look cakey, beyond what normal makeup on normal skin looks like. It does what a skin tint should, but not for the price point in my opinion.",

I wanted a more advanced mature look and I wanted better quality makeup to properly care for my skin.\nFoundation was the first place I started.\nI went to almost every makeup kiosk in the dept stores and got lots of foundation samples to try. Amongst them were Estée Lauder, Chanel, Origins, Laura Mercier, and of course Clinique.\nI tried every single one at least a few times, but in the end I kept coming back to this one. It's lightweight, evens my skin tone greatly, is so smooth, and didn't bother my skin at all. I'm sorry but there was no contest. The others just did not stand up against this one. Mind you I was completely unbiased. I just wanted fresh looking even skin with a lightweight feel, and this was the only foundation to deliver that for me.\nI was completely ready to pay the very high prices of the other brands too, but no need, at around $25, I've had this fantastic foundation for nearly a year and am only now beginning to run out.\nProps to Clinique for this one!",

I haven't had a break out using the pore refining solution foundation but as soon as I started using the even better foundation I had terrible breakouts and my face always looked greasy and oily. I started using Clinique to help with breakouts and it definitely helped until using the even better foundation. I hope Clinique will go back to the pore refining solution foundation or come out with a product like it.",
