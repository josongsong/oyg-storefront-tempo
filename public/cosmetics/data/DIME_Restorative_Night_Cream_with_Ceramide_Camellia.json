This has been the last step in my nightly routine and it works nicely on top of my other products (toner and retinol serum.) It's rich, ultra moisturizing and leaves my skin with a nice glow. I wake up with very soft, smooth skin. Because it is quite thick, it may not be great for people with oily skin. Since we're heading into summer, I will be switching to something more lightweight, but I could see myself purchasing this again, come winter.",

It reminds me of the peeling gels that pull off dead skin cells. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the rest of the jar but I won't be using it on my face. There are many other great night creams out there so I'll keep using Perricone, Kora Organics and Clarins.",

This cream is packed with high-quality ingredients that work together to nourish, hydrate, and repair the skin while I sleep. What I love most about this night cream is its ability to provide deep hydration to my skin. The texture is rich and creamy, but it doesn't feel heavy or greasy on my skin. Instead, it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft, supple, and well-hydrated. Another thing I appreciate about this night cream is its ability to improve the overall appearance of my skin. It contains a blend of natural ingredients like shea butter, jojoba oil, and vitamin E that work together to repair and rejuvenate the skin. After using it consistently for several weeks, I noticed a significant improvement in the texture and firmness of my skin. I also love that this night cream is free from harsh chemicals and artificial fragrances. It's gentle on the skin and doesn't cause any irritation or breakouts. And the subtle, natural scent is really pleasant and relaxing, which is perfect for winding down before bed. Overall, I highly recommend Dime Beauty Restorative Night Cream to anyone looking for a high-quality, hydrating night cream that delivers real results. With regular use, you'll notice smoother, more youthful-looking skin that feels soft, supple, and well-nourished. It's definitely worth giving a try!",

        "comments": "I wanted to love this but I don't. The cream is super greasy, doesn't absorb and pills. I may be the only one experiencing this since there are so many great reviews. I have tried this several times with different serums and no matter what I use, it will not absorb into my skin. It also pills if I touch my face. It reminds me of the peeling gels that pull off dead skin cells. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the rest of the jar but I won't be using it on my face. There are many other great night creams out there so I'll keep using Perricone, Kora Organics and Clarins.",
