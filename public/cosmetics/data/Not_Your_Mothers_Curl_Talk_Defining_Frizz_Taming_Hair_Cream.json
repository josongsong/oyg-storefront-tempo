It was so terrible that I had to wash my hair the very next day. \n\nI do like to use this when I have to wear my hair up. I work as a barista so I will wash my hair and use just this so my curls look pretty when I put them into a messy bun. works great for that kind of purpose.",

        "comments": "I have that wavy/curly hair that always looks a little unruly and turns into a giant poof ball if I brush it, but will be curly if treated with the right products and routine. It's also a bit on the finer side. Unfortunately, I'm a pretty lazy girl compounded by the fact that I have to be up at 3:30 in the morning for work so I'm not into a lengthy routine and I hate using tons of product in my hair. I picked this up at another store on a whim one day and I love it. If I apply it to my hair when it's wet (not dripping, just towel dry) and scrunch while blow drying, it definitely gives my hair more of a curly look. Does not leave a crunchy or oily feeling. I also noticed that it does help control the frizz decently (which is a tall order because I live in 100,000% humidity SWFL). I even use it when I want to straighten my hair to help the frizz. It has a beautiful scent, not super light but not overwhelming, and the scent lightens as my hair drys leaving only a hint if I stick my hose right into my hair. The scent is fresh, sorta cocoa buttery, not floral to my nose. I'm super sensitive to fragrance, especially florals, but this is just heavenly. I'm about to grab a couple of bottles because my son tried it in his ridiculously beautiful, thick, wavy hair and won't give it back! Bottom line, it works for both my bipolar, fine hair and my son's thick waves without greasy residue or making it stiff.",

(Before applying this product, my hair was heavily saturated with water, to the point some drops were coming out of the section.) I thought it was a bit weird but assumed it was because I recently dyed my hair, and sprayed some more water on my hair as well as conditioner, but it wasn't enough as my hair stayed feeling this way and my hair ending up airdrying dehydrated and it became frizzy as well. This product did nothing but dry my hair out.\n\nI had already washed my hair once since dying my hair using a different styling product and I had great results, with my hair feeling moisturized and not dry at all. I've always used thick styling creams like Cantu's Coconut Curling Cream which has worked great for me, but I thought I'd try something more lightweight and after seeing curly hair YouTubers review and speak highly of the entire Curl Talk line, I decided to get this product. This is one of the worst results I've had and although I wish it worked for me because I love the packaging, I don't think I'll be using it again. For anyone wondering what the consistency is like, it looks and feels like Elmer's Glue.",
