My physician recommended that I use only CeraVe products, including these wipes to start the cleansing process every night. They are excellent for removing makeup, however, I think they may have changed their formulation.  They are now causing a burning sensation, and my skin has become more dry and irritated.  I thought it was a fluke or a bad lot, so I purchased a different pack at another store, and the same thing happened.  Unfortunately, I will not be using these anymore.",

Maybe its like cilantro … only some people are affected? Anyway, I like the wipes. They do a great job removing makeup (including waterproof mascara) without drying my skin. I like to take them camping and traveling as they're very convenient. Wish the packaging was a little better as the opener doesn't restick well, but it's definitely not a deal breaker.",

        "comments": "I love the idea of a plant based wipe that is biodegradable, much better than any other wipes I know of. CeraVe's plant based makeup wipe is a bit thin but if you're not too rough then it won't tear on you. I like that it's hydrating since I live in a dry area so that it doesn't strip my skin. It does also remove waterproof makeup with not too much effort. However I found that after wiping my eyes especially after a few times they were reacting like you would while cutting onions. I don't normally have any issues with wipes so I found it strange, but after a while it went away. I would say these work really well but as with most wipes this didn't get everything entirely. I used this same lines toner and it got everything left so I didn't have to fully wash my face if I didn't have time to after. But if you want your face truly clean then you'll have to wash it a little after or use toner. Overall I would still use these and just be a bit more gentle around the eyes.",

        "comments": "As a beauty professional active for 20+ year's, I've tried a few facial wipes in my day. CeraVe came out with a very good product, especially for dryer skin types. \nIt's a bigger facial wipe, other brands aren't as big. It had a weird odor to it, even though it's supposed to be scent free, it was enough to bother me which is why I only gave 3 stars. \nI love how soft and gentle the wipes are, they cleansed my skin great! These are dermatologist tested as well as developed by dermatologists. Very hydrating, my skin felt so fresh and clean after every use.",
