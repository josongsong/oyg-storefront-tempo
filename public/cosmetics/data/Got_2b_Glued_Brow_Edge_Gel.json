This truly holds my hairs in place all day in exactly how I combed them. Other brow \"glues\" eventually kind of melt down and the hairs go down but this almost feels like it's hair sprayed on if that makes sense lol like I know they're not budging. I also use it for my baby hairs but I have to use a very light hand cause if you put too much it does become hard. I also use a light hand on my brows since if you use too much it'll harden on your skin. I don't wear makeup to work, but I make sure to use this on my brows every single day. It withstood insane wind and rain during my engagement photoshoot so I'll be repurchasing this for sure. I'd even say it's a HG.",

        "comments": "So I wasn't the biggest fan of this product for both my eyebrows and my fly aways but for totally different ways. I used it first for my eyebrows as a base to lay my brow hairs up some before I fill them in. For some reason it wasn't giving me much hold on my eyebrows. I expected more out of the got2b glued named. So then I decided to use it on the little sideburns I cant ever get to stay held back by my headband. This worked perfect at first. The bristle wand is longer on one side than the other and I found it really easy to brush through my hair. It has a really nice like shampoo scent to it (shampoo always smells faintly like apples to me) but then I noticed as I went throughout the day it hardened and got really crunchy. I was kinda embarrassed how it looked. I also wasn't ready to wash my hair so I had to pick the crunch out of my hair as it looked awful. I would use sparingly and make sure you're prepared to wash your hair later.",
