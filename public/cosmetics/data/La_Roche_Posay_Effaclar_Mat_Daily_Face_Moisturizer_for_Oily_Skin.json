It absorbs quickly, not greasy, and hasnt broken me out at all. Its helping the dry patches from the cold winter air/heaters running. My issue is its almost $40 for a pretty small tube. While the tube is travel/storage friendly and I love not having to dip into a jar, the price on this feels excessive for the amount you get. Im going to repurchase because its all my skin seems to tolerate so apprently my skin just has to be bougee. :/",

After reading reviews, i decided to give this moisturizer a try. Im glad i did. So far this has been the only moisturizer  I've found that gives me the hydration I need without my skin becoming oily. For me, a little goes a long way. It does take some time for it to be fully absorbed into my skin and the cost is crazy for something so small but my face seems to like it so I'll be purchasing more.",

This for me, is the absolute best. Yes, the price point is a bit steep, but with skincare sometimes you get what you pay for, and this is definitely one of those times. A little really goes a long way with this lightweight, gel-cream consistency moisturizer so that helps make it a better value. It goes on like a dream, has a delicious light scent (I'm not completely against fragrance myself if it's done right) and actually keeps my skin looking matte and smooth all day. Overall, I really enjoy many La Roche-Posay products, but this, hands down is my favorite. If you're looking for lightweight mattifying hydration, try this one out for yourself.",

Even hours after putting it on. It lasts around 4-5ish hours. Definitely have to reapply if youre working and sweating a lot though. Only con is that it is quite expensive for the amount you get. I do have the other matte moisturizer from LRP and it doesnt work as quite good for me, so this one is the best for matte moisturizers from them! Would have been a 5/5 if not for the price.",

I wash my face with Effaclar Purifying Foaming Gel first and then use this moisturizer and let me tell you after a week there is a big difference. I have rosacea and very sensitive skin and this stuff is so gentle and has improved my skin in a week of using it in the morning and at night after first washing my face with the purifying gel.",
