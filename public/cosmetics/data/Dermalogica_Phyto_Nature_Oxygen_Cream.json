Oxygen Cream is a high-performance moisturizer that delivers powerful anti-aging benefits while hydrating and revitalizing the skin. This cream is formulated with a unique blend of plant-based ingredients and advanced biotechnology to help protect and repair the skin's natural barrier.  One of the standout features of this cream is its innovative packaging, which combines two formulas into one jar. The cream is separated into two chambers - one containing a rich, nourishing cream, and the other a lightweight gel. When dispensed, the two formulas are blended together to create a luxurious, whipped texture that feels incredibly indulgent on the skin.  The rich cream contains a blend of peptides, antioxidants, and botanical extracts, which work together to firm and lift the skin, reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and improve overall skin texture and tone. The lightweight gel is infused with encapsulated oxygen, which helps to energize the skin and promote a healthy, radiant complexion.  I found this cream to be incredibly effective at hydrating my skin, leaving it feeling plump and smooth all day long. It absorbed quickly into my skin without leaving any greasy or sticky residue, and I loved how soft and supple my skin felt after using it.  Overall, I would highly recommend Dermalogica's Phyto Nature Oxygen Cream to anyone looking for a high-quality anti-aging moisturizer that delivers real results. The innovative packaging, luxurious texture, and powerful ingredients make this cream a standout product that truly delivers on its promises.",

My skin pre pandemic was something to really envy and I haven't been able to get back to that point just yet. I didn't notice my forehead lines being plumped which are my biggest concern. Again I really do enjoy this moisturizer but the price is a tough one to swallow for not living up to its claims",
