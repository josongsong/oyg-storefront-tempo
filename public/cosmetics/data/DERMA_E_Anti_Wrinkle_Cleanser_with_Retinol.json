I have normal oily skin and I wear concealer,  powder and light eye makeup. This washes it all away.  Though it stings my eyes, so I wash them quickly. No smell. Leaves my face clean and refreshed. I may double wash from time to time, but not usually. Grest price too. I will buy again.",

This one is definitely one that works well. It doesn't dry out my skin or break me out. I feel like it removes my makeup well. A little goes a long way and the bottle is pretty big given how little you need to use. The price is great too. There's really not a downside.\nI'm 45, but apparently no one told my face that puberty ended more than 30 years ago, because I can still breakout when a cleanser doesn't work well enough. Usually my skin isn't really dry or oily, but certain products can definitely take me into either territory. I have some uneven tone, though with the use of good products, it's improving well. I feel like this is one of those good products. \nI'm really happy with this face wash and I anticipate repurchased when this bottle is finally gone.",

Am I absolutely in love with it? No. But there's nothing wrong with it. I wouldn't say I've noticed a significant change in the texture of my skin and I use it daily. So to market it as anti-wrinkle/aging feels a bit misleading. HOWEVER- I LOVE that my skin didn't feel dried out or stripped afterward. No tight feeling, just clean, soft skin. And I do love that aspect of it. The scent is meh. It's not terrible or overwhelming and it's gone once you rinse it away. I do wish all their products had the citrus scent that their cleansing balm has but I'm not a stickler about scent. Would I buy it again? Maybe. I use 2-3 pumps every time i wash my face (which is probably too much) and I feel it's lasted quite awhile and for the price, overall pretty great. I do think I should probably explore their other cleansers before repurchasing it but I probably would and I would recommend it to anyone!",
