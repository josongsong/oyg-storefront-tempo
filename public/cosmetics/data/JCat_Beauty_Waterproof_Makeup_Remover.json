I usually have to soak a cotton pad, resulting in alot of product use, and have to hold it to my eye for 30 seconds or more. I didn't have to do either with this. Easily rubbed completely off without irritating my eyes. The cucumber scent is an added bonus. Wish this was inside of stores so I didn't have to reorder.",
