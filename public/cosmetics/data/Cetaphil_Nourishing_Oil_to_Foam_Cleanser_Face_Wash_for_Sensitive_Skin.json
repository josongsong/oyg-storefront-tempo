        "comments": "I got this cleanser because I was previously using albolene to remove makeup, then La Roche Posay's toleraine cleanser and it left a film on my face causing breakouts. I wear sunscreen daily, sometimes makeup. I have contact allergies to fragrance and other things, so I'm limited in what I can use. This cleanser does not contain my allergens. It feels like an oil at first, but emulsifies on the skin well and removes the makeup/ sunscreen well. It rinses off easily without leaving a film. My skin doesn't feel dry, tight, or irritated. I like this cleanser. It does the job and it's affordable. \nFor reference, I can't use Cerave products because they burn my skin, but this doesn't leave my skin red or burn at all. If you have sensitive or dry skin, this cleanser is worth trying. I am happy with it.",
