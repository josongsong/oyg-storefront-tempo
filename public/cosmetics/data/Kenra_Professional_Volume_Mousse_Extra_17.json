When the spray gel I used for years was discontinued, I had to find another product.  I have been searching for a few years and have spent so much money looking until this product came up when I was doing some searches for things.  I have very course, curly hair that will frizz out of control on humid day. This product has been wonderful for my hair and I'm honestly quite shocked as I didn't expect it.  My curls look smooth and defined yet soft.  There is a bit of hold to this product and can feel a little sticky going on, but the end result after my hair dries is gorgeous.  No crunchiness.  I honestly can't say enough and just pray they don't discontinue this!",
