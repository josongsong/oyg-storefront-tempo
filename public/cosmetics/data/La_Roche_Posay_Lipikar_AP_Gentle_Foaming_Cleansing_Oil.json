I figured maybe my skin isn't used to it but then the next day my skin was SOOOO dry even after applying my moisturizer & sunscreen. Eventually the irritation got so painful I had to stop using it. as soon as I went back to the hydrating gentle cleanse my face went back to normal.",

It does remove make up really well however it's not particularly hydrating, and as I wait for my face to dry, it does feel a bit tight and is certainly not hydrated, if a bit tight. Ill keep giving it a go just to see but I'll probably downgrade this to a body wash or see if my husband likes it.",

        "comments": "I can't say enough good things about La Roche-Posay's Foaming Cleansing Oil! From the first use, it made a noticeable difference in how my skin felt—clean, soft, and incredibly nourished without any tightness or irritation. Unlike many cleansers that strip moisture away, this formula gently lifts away impurities while actually strengthening the skin barrier.\n\nThe texture is luxurious—it foams just enough without feeling heavy or greasy, making it perfect for both morning and night routines. Plus, a little goes a long way, so the bottle lasts much longer than expected. It's enriched with soothing ingredients like niacinamide and shea butter, which leave the skin feeling calm and hydrated.\n\nAs someone with sensitive, dry-prone skin, finding a cleanser that truly cleans without causing redness or dryness has always been a challenge. This one checks every box. It's also fragrance-light, dermatologist-recommended, and safe for the whole family, which makes it even more impressive.\n\nIf you're looking for a cleanser that protects your skin's natural balance while giving you a fresh, clean feeling, I highly recommend La Roche-Posay Foaming Cleansing Oil. It's truly a game-changer!",

        "comments": "I recently tried La Roche Posay's Lipikar Oil, a fragrance-free gentle foaming cleansing oil. Having dry and sensitive skin, I was intrigued by the product's claims of being fragrance-free and suitable for both face and body. \n\nFirstly, I must say that the fragrance-free claim is 100% accurate. This is a significant advantage for individuals with sensitive skin or those who prefer products without added scents. I appreciated that the product didn't have any overpowering fragrance. I did a sniff test, as did my husband, and we smelled absolutely nothing.\n\nLiving in the dry heat of Vegas where temperatures often exceed 100 degrees, my skin tends to become dehydrated quickly. When using Lipikar Oil, I noticed that my skin felt more hydrated and nourished compared to some other cleansers I've tried. It effectively cleansed my skin without stripping away its natural moisture.\n\nOne of the standout features of Lipikar Oil is its versatility. Being suitable for both the face and body, it offers convenience and multi-purpose functionality. I used it solely on my body, but the fam used it for their entire body. I, personally, am not a huge fan of all-in-one cleansers and use products specifically for my face, but for my husband and kids, it's  incredibly convenient for their skincare routine. It saves time and space in my husband and kiddo's skincare routine, as they can use it in the shower for their entire body, including their face. The formula is gentle and didn't cause any irritation or dryness on my skin.\n\nOverall, La Roche Posay's Lipikar Oil is a reliable and fragrance-free cleansing oil that caters well to dry and sensitive skin. Its ability to cleanse without drying and its versatility for use on both the face and body make it a convenient option. In the hot and dry conditions of Vegas, I appreciated its hydrating properties.\n\nLipikar Oil is accepted by the National Eczema Association, making it a good choice for those seeking a gentle and effective cleansing option for dry and/or sensitive skin.",
