I can 100% say this is for sensitive skin. \n\nI used it as intended. I do like it as night cream. I feel it did proctect my skin barrier, but i do feel my skin needs something a little more hydrating. So i wear another moisturizer on top.  I do like it for the daytime because i feel i can wear makeup over it. \n\nWhy i love it. \nI get heat rashes on my face whenever i come in contact with heat or the sun. I get little bumps all over my face and I turn red. Well i started wearing this as my daily moisturizer during the day and it turns out the barrier protection in this product is amazing. Whenever i wear this product during the day i do not breakout in rashes even if i am in the sun. I finally have smooth skin bc of this cream. \nThis cream has truly improved my skincare, my makeup and the look of my skin. I love it!!",

The smell is weird in the container but you don't smell it on your face. Anyways, when I woke up my acne looked incredible. When I break out the acne gets so red, when I woke up I saw little to no redness.

There are several reviews calling your generic bluff about going by weight because people have been getting a different weight each time they buy this product. We want you to show you are hearing our complaints by actually changing something to improve the product & product experience. Jars are not the most hygienic version of product storage, it would be more sanitary as a pump. As skin care experts I imagine you know that so why bother with a jar? Put more product in there or make the packaging better fit the product then I will recommend.",
