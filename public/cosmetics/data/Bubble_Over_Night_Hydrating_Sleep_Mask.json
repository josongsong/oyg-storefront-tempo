        "comments": "As someone who loves indulging in skincare rituals, I recently had the pleasure of trying out Bubble's Overnight Hydrating Sleep Mask, and I must say, it was a truly refreshing and rejuvenating experience. This review aims to share my first-person perspective on this fantastic product.  First and foremost, let's talk about the packaging. The sleek, minimalistic design of the jar instantly caught my eye. The quality of the materials used is evident, and the container feels sturdy and secure. I appreciate the attention to detail, as the product comes with a handy spatula for hygienic application.  The moment I opened the jar, a delightful, subtle fragrance wafted out, creating a relaxing atmosphere. The texture of the sleep mask is luxuriously creamy, allowing it to glide effortlessly onto the skin. The product spreads evenly, and a little goes a long way, ensuring the jar will last for many applications.  Upon application, the sleep mask feels lightweight and non-greasy, which is a significant plus for those like me who prefer products that don't leave a heavy residue. The mask quickly absorbs into the skin, leaving behind a soft, silky feeling.  One of the most impressive aspects of Bubble's Overnight Hydrating Sleep Mask is its moisturizing power. As someone with dry skin, I am always on the lookout for products that provide intense hydration, especially during the night when my skin needs it the most. This sleep mask exceeded my expectations. Each morning after using it, I woke up to incredibly nourished and plump skin. The product effectively seals in moisture, giving my complexion a healthy and radiant appearance.",

        "comments": "I got this product for my birthday and at first I was delighted, the boxing was great, and the product was unbelievably hydrating. But overtime once I started to get more and more skincare and making up a routine, I would put this on and immediately the rest of my skincare would start pealing off my face. All of it would come off in strings onto my hands. Like WHAT! I was super confused and didn't understand why this was happening. I later kind of stopped using it and adjusting my skincare routine. I think I maybe wasn't putting it in the right order of the rest of my products, I don't know. I haven't tried this product again after that but I want to soon. Also the smell really grossed me out and I couldn't stand it. Maybe it was just me. I would recommend this to a friend, someone with young skin. I think it was just my skin but something to keep in mind. I use a lot of products you only need 2-4. I hope you continue to try this product but in case, I hoped his review was helpful.",
