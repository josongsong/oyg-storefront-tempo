But it ended up looking cakey almost immediately, and 30 mins later it began to separate badly in my nose. It just looked horrible. I've tried changing up my primer, powder, etc and it's still the same. I really wanted to love it since it is full coverage, but at what cost? I cant wear it at all because I work high-end retail sales, and how I present myself at work is important. Super disappointing. I've never had this issue with a foundation before.",

        "comments": "I have been on the hunt for a foundation that has good coverage and does not transfer.  I was a long-time user of Estee Lauder's Double Wear; however, it started to really dry my skin out, and in turn, exacerbate my dry patches when I would wear makeup.  I've tried others with claims of being transfer proof, and that was the only one I had tried that lived up to the claim.  As an active girly who gets dirty and sweats, I still like my foundation to stay in place and not slide everywhere or transfer onto my clothes when my face/neck sweats.  I had high hopes for this foundation, and I honestly was not disappointed!  I applied this with a flat foundation brush and worked in small sections on my face because matte foundations have a tendency to dry down faster in my opinion.  The coverage for me was medium to full, and it was easily buildable on the areas I wanted extra coverage.  I picked the 033 medium light because, based on other reviews, the foundation dries down darker.  I am normally a straight medium and prefer neutral tones, and when this dried down, it was a PERFECT match!  It layered over my skincare products and primer nicely, and I thought other makeup products sat nicely on it without disturbing the foundation.  I hate when I like a foundation and other products disturb it by making it patchy or muddying it, but this one did well!  I put the foundation to the test by going to a 3 hour gym sweat sesh, and I can honestly say it looked just as good as when I first applied it.  I did not set it with a powder or a setting spray because I wanted to see if this was legit transfer proof on its own.  While it was still mostly matte by the end of the workout, I could still see some glow underneath, which I also really liked!  It looked very natural.  I felt it was very light on the skin compared to my tried and true Double Wear, and with spring and summer around the corner, I can see me reaching for this more.  At the end of the night, my face still looked good, and it did hold up to its claim of being transfer proof, even without setting powder or spray.  This was my first and only time using this foundation so far, but I look forward to using it more and seeing how it stacks up in the summer!",

        "comments": "After reviewing this product every day for the last 3 weeks, I have mixed feelings about it. I agree with the claims that it is full coverage and meant for more oily combination skin types. However, I found that it could work for those who have a drier skin type. I have been using acne cleaners and solutions for my hormonal acne, so my skin lately has been on the drier side; but I normally have oily combo skin. When I prep my skin very well this foundation looks great. I found that it paired very well with my Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream on those days where my skin was super dry. It made the foundation have more of a satin finish and it looked beautiful. On the flip side, I had to do a lot of trial and error with this foundation because it did not mix well with my skin care routine, moisturizers, primers, etc. I will attach a photo for reference. I would do my normal routine: apply the primer (which is a great primer), add the foundation, and complete my makeup. Through out the day it would \"flake\" or peel up and it looked horrible! I found that with this foundation I can only pair it with the primer and my Tatcha moisturizer, anything else will not set well with it. The foundation itself is very full coverage and you do not need a lot. You do need to work fast with this foundation or work in smaller areas because it dries down quick! I work in the hospital setting where I still have to wear a mask and overall the transfer proof claim is legitimate. There is a tiny, tiny bit of transfer but overall great. Again, love-hate relationship with this foundation. When I can make it work I love the way it looks, but when it doesn't mix well with other products it peels off and looks terrible. \n-Attached are two photos; one where it peels and one in natural lighting. They are natural, non filtered photos.",
