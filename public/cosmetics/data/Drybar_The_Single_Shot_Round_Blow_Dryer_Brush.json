Anyway, I finally pulled the trigger and I'm glad I did. I have very thick, wavy, more coarse blonde hair. I must say the first time I used this I could not be more impressed. Not only did it dry my hair, faster, but it gave me the curl at the bottom that I wasn't getting from my oval one. It also gave me a smoother more shiny blowout. I could not be more impressed and I highly recommend this single shot dryer styler. It's very easy to hold and it's lightweight which I also love.",

        "comments": "Have the Dyson, Bondi Boost, Shark, L'Ange - yep all of them.  If you have thick curly hair that you straighten OR straighten Day 2 / 3 curls, THIS is it. Hot Air way less damaging than radiant heat / iron type tools. The brush is PART OF the end to end unit - this makes a difference! Many have the replaceable heads, which are good, but bend a bit. The shot series (specifically Single Shot ROUND brush) can get me from damp to bouncy shiny straight in 20 mins, dry curly to sexy straight in 10!! The larger oval brushes make hair too straight; this slightly, smaller and ROUND barrel gives great volume. With barrel part of unit, it's like part of your arm & you can move REALLY fast. And 1100 watts of power is perfect. Of the 7 I own, I literally use this on constant repeat!!!",

My hair looks like it did years ago.  So much body and bounce!  I do use a hair dryer to get it a bit dry before I start.  I have had better results with Pantene mousse than styling spray.  I use a curling iron on my bangs and to get a bit of a bend at the roots.  So for me it isn't a one and done product but the results are phenominal and last.  If you're looking for a fast dry that results in a sleek look, go with the Revlon.  If you are looking for a more styled look that feels great, get the single shot.  Wait for a sale though.",

I'm a long time consumer and this item wasn't cheap. Customer service wouldn't even hear me out. They just kept repeating it was past 30 days.

My hair looks better using this one than my previous styling tool.",

        "comments": "I purchased in-store because my friend had the Revlon version. She's got pin straight shoulder length hair though, and I really didn't trust it. I go to DryBar usually once a week, and the styles will last about 4 days with dry shampoo. I usually only wash my hair once a week, so it's something that works for me. I have hard water at home and the salon water makes my hair feel soft and refreshed.\n\nMy scalp has been increasing its dandruff production with summer though, and I've needed to wash 2x week now. \nThe problem is I've never been able to recreate the blowout look at home, and I can't afford 2 blowouts a week. My hair is naturally curly, and I can style it just fine for curls, but I get really hot with my curls (I work in the medical field so I'm in surgical gown, scrubs, masks, face shield, and a really hot overhead light).\nI've seen curly heads prefer this one to Revlon, and a girl at DryBar even told me it's because the Revlon isn't meant for wet hair, but this brush actually is. She said for the Revlon, I'd have to blow dry, straighten, then use it.\nI'm the type of person, if I'm going to spend money on something I'd rather buy \"the best\" than buy the knockoff and eventually end up buying the better one. \nAlso, this is a round circle brush compared to the Revlon oval and the DryBar oval double shot.\nI've never used either, this is my 1st dryer brush.\nI showered, used my DryBar liquid glass shampoo/conditioner because it smoothes my thick cuticles well. A lot of reviews/YouTubers said to not use it on dripping hair. I did what they typically do at DryBar. I wrung out my hair before twisting it in a microfiber towel. I tied the towel and my hair with a hair tie for about 10 minutes. It was damp but not dripping at all, I was honestly worried it was a little too dry. I sprayed prep rally detangle/heat protection spray and brushed it with a Tangle Teazer wet brush, sorry AND the drybar heat protection/quick dry serum. I probably could have just done the quick dry serum(2 pumps) but I didn't think about it until after the spray. With the quick dry serum and a normal blow dryer, it takes me 40 minutes to dry. Without the serum, we're looking at an hour. My hair is thick, curly, and to my mid back when straight/styled. \nA lot of people said to section your hair like you're curling or straightening it. \nJust WOW. \nI critiqued some YouTubers for flipping their hair different ways, at DryBar they blow dry it one direction (like you would curling/straightening), and it gives a nice half curl/flip at the ends. I don't think this brush could do that with my hair specifically. It probably would give nice curls/flip for shorter or straight hair. \nIt would dry large sections 3-5inches across in about a minute. I HAD to use the brush both directions to dry the hair completely. I noticed my ends would dry before my roots, so I started letting it rest at the roots before dragging it down to the ends. It WILL get caught/stuck on your ends if you try to curl it too far up on the shaft. I could only flip it at the ends, and this I think is due to how the barrel is round/smaller than the double shot. \nSo with sections, curling it both directions, I eventually turned my head upside down and used it like a hair brush to get my slightly damp scalp dry. It did the trick!\nI had my whole head straight & voluminous after just 20 minutes. It had a slight curl on the ends but not what it gave a lot of straight/shorter hair. \nI sprayed DryBar hot toddy on my hair, heat protection but not a wet spray, dry like hairspray before I went over it with a 2\" barrel curling iron from Kristin Ess. I notice that a 2\" curling iron gives more of blowout curls than a wand. (I use a Paul Mitchell 1\" flat iron, Paul Mitchell 1\" wand or 1.25\" Kristen Ess wand to do tighter curls depending on what type of curl I want.) I wanted more of a body wave than full curls. \nDid a full blowout and everything in 40 minutes! It looks amazing! For long curly hair, I think you won't get an immediate blowout from this, and I wanted to rate it 4 stars for myself, but it just got my hair dry so fast I don't think it deserves anything less than 5 stars. My hair was smooth and glossy too!\n\nThe brush DID NOT snag my hair like a YouTuber said it did her hair. I do wonder at how to clean the hair out of it over time though. It's just a few strands, but the bristles are course and hold onto it pretty good. I definitely recommend just trying to pull out what you can after each use. I'm THRILLED with being able to get great results on my 1st use. There's usually a learning curve.",

        "comments": "I tried the Single Shot because I love the Double Shot but hoped the Single Shot might give me a bit more curl at the ends.  It's possible that I could have gotten more curl from the Single Shot if I had been able to tolerate it long enough to really focus on trying to curl the ends, but two design flaws made the Single Shot very frustrating to use:  #1) The crease at the transition point between the handle and the barrel on the Single Shot kept catching and pulling my hair out (I don't have this problem with the Double Shot).  #2)  I found it much more difficult to rotate and maneuver the Single Shot in my hair vs. the Double Shot (I think the shape of the Double Shot tip is just an easier shape to grab with your second hand to help turn it as you run it through your hair).  \n\nFor those two reasons, I just wanted to get through the blowout with the Single Shot as quickly as possible and did not take the extra time to really focus on trying to get extra curl at the ends, so my end result with the Single Shot was pretty similar to the look I get with the Double Shot (nice and straight with just a little flip on the ends).  The Single Shot did deliver a nice, smooth blowout overall, much like the Double Shot.  But the Double Shot is MUCH more user friendly and does not have a crease that catches and pulls out my hair.  The possibility of a bit more curl from the Single Shot is just not worth it to me.  I highly recommend the Double Shot though!",
