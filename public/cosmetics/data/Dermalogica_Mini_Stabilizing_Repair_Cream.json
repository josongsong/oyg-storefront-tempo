The moisturizer was not doing much to keep my sensitive combination skin hydrated so I gave this a try with 100% on my Yuka app, i thought why not. I was a it nervous to try something new and I am glad i gave it a try. Let me tell you, I saw a major improvement from just one application. I hate the cost but I am loving the results. I am 47 and have been using it for a week, I can usually tell if I something will work with my skin within a few days because of how sensitive it is. This was a winner for me.",

This cream is a true lifesaver for my oily and acne-prone skin!\n\nThe lightweight formula is easily absorbed, leaving no greasy residue behind. It effectively hydrates my skin without causing any breakouts or clogging pores. I appreciate that it contains natural ingredients that are gentle on my skin and help to soothe any redness or irritation.\n\nWhat impresses me the most is how well this cream controls excess oil throughout the day. It has significantly reduced the shine on my face, giving it a more matte finish without feeling dry or tight. My makeup stays put for longer, which is a big plus for me.\n\nThe Stabilizing Repair Cream has also helped fade some of my acne scars and evened out my skin tone. My complexion looks healthier and more radiant than ever before.\n\nThe only reason I'm not giving it a full 5 stars is the price, which is a bit on the higher side. However, considering the excellent results and how little product is needed per application, it's worth the investment.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the Dermalogica Stabilizing Repair Cream to anyone with acne-prone skin. It's a game-changer, and I will definitely repurchase it. Disclaimer: This was gifted by Dermalogica for my honest review.",

If this product is taking the place of Barrier Repair, I will never buy it! It is the stickiest mess I have ever used. It is certainly a down grade! The Barrier Repair was so smooth to apply and I could rub it into my hands when I was done. This new cream is awful, it does not go on anywhere near as smooth and I had to wash my hands after I applied since it left a sticky residue on my face and hands. I had started using the Barrier Repair because I had an allergic reaction on my neck that caused is horrific rash. Barrier Repair cleaned up the rash stopped the itching and allergic reaction. I used the Stabilizing for the first time tonight and had to wash it off since it caused the skin on my neck to become hot to the touch and start itching again. I hate this stuff. You have definitely created a much inferior product compared to Barrier Repair. DO NOT DISCONTINUE BARRIER REPAIR!!!",
