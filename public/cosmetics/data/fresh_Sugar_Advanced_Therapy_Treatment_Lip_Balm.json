        "comments": "About a year ago, I noticed my lips started to show very deep lines and looked awful when I tried to wear lipstick.  It wasn't so much and issue of me needing lip balm on a moment to moment basis, but I needed some kind of regime to get my lips to look fuller and smoother.  After doing a little research I decided to go with fresh Sugar Advanced Therapy Treatment and the Laneige Sleeping Mask.  I use the mask at night when I remember, but the important thing is that I put the fresh Sugar on every morning before doing my makeup.  My lips look and feel so much better it's crazy.  It really has plumped and smoothed out my lips.  And the results were fairly quick.  It has such a nice smooth texture. It doesn't feel waxy or thick, but it isn't oily or thin either.  It's velvety and it sinks in, but also creates a nice barrier of protection.  It may be the very first lip balm that I've every used until it was completely gone.",

He has terrible chapped lips and won't keep using ANY other lip balm. I used many different brands balms with varied results but nothing has been as good as Fresh. I bought a mini on a whim a while back and hadn't tried it until recently. What a mistake! I used it for a few days and my lips stopped peeling so quickly! I had become so used to having to coax the dead dry skin off my lips that I didn't realize how constant it was. I am very sensitive to toothpastes (flouride, etc) and mouthwash and the ingredients in this are perfect for me. I gushed about the results to my husband and he wanted to try it. In less than 4 days it repaired his lips 100%. They were so bad before. Like a little kid that has been outside all summer bad. I told him the price of getting a full size and he suggested getting 2. He could have cared less about any other lip product he's ever tried but this one is magic.",

You can never go wrong with clean, cruelty free, vegan and eco friendly beauty products!!!!",
