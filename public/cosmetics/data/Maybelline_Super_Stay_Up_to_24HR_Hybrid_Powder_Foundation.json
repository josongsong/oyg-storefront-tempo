Here's a list of ones ive tried and i still like this better than: Make Up For Ever blurring powder foundation, Bareminerals original loose powder mineral foundation, Jane Iredale loose powder foundation, Jane Iredale pressed powder foundation, Tarte Amazonian Clay loose powder foundation. So yeah — ive tried A LOT. Everytime i come back to this one, i question why i keep trying to find something better. Make sure to first prep your skin with a good moisturizer and primer before applying. Let both fully absorb and dry before applying a powder foundation. This is simply the best ive found and each time i wear it, i get told how good my skin looks and even most recently, how i look like im still in my 20s lol. Im way past 20s.",

This powder foundation not only covers better than the luxury brand, it looks and performs better, for a third of the price! The shade is also a perfect match for my fair but olive skintone, not to pink or yellow, just right. I am 37 with dry skin and this still works for me. It does not settle into fine lines, crease, cake up, or become shiny throughout the day. I wear it to work every day and am considering it as my wedding foundation for later this year! I apply it with a brush when I want less coverage and with the accompanying sponge when I want more coverage. It lasts all day and does not transfer. I typically use a setting spray afterwards but even when I forget it still lasts and looks good. I just cant say enough good things about this product!",

It can be built up to absolute full coverage but, in my opinion, that can look a bit cakey and too artificial. I use a flat top brush to apply this mostly to my nose and cheeks where I've got the most redness then pull it outward and I'm never not satisfied with the coverage.

Today is July 9. I'm returning it tomorrow when I get off of work. I Gave it a weeks try and nothing good for me. I bought it on June 25.",

I apply it over my regular foundation and just in certain areas like my cheeks and forehead with the provided applicator and lightly with a brush in the areas that my skin is more \"mature\". I've gotten so many compliments on my skin and I'm 51. I think the low reviews might often be people applying it incorrectly. My only issue is that it's brittle as you can see in the picture. I just realized today that I can press it back in somewhat. I just cannot take it anywhere because it is messy. I will buy again though. Thank you, again, Maybelline for another great product at an affordable price!!",

Their \"darkest shade\" is simply unacceptable given that many brands have twice the range on their initial launches. Their unwillingness to include darker ranges at this point is a blatant statement that they don't care about dark skin. They can absolutely afford to do better, they're just choosing not to.",
