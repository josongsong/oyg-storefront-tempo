For a few years, I experienced moderate cystic acne (it seemed more severe to me than my diagnosis indicated). I couldn't get the acne under control no matter what I tried and I tried it ALL. I even submitted myself to a series of painful laser treatments in an attempt to get it under control. The more medications and treatments I tried, the drier my skin became and the more I relied on lotions and moisturizers which only seemed to further exacerbate my underlying condition. The more acne and subsequent scarring I experienced, the more makeup products I used to cover and conceal. I finally figured out the culprit: silicones! Silicones were in absolutely everything I had been putting on my face for years; sheet masks, moisturizes, lotions, primers, foundation, powder, etc. It took some time but once I switched to a completely silicone-free skincare regime and makeup routine, including the Good Molecules Priming Moisturizer, I no longer experience cystic acne. The Good Molecules Priming Moisturizer has been working absolutely wonderfully for me. It's difficult to find a decent silicone-free moisturizer that isn't too heavy/rich in emollients for my slightly oily skin and the other silicone-free primers seemed so sticky and icky to me. This duo product is perfect for me.",

I never break out on my forehead, only on my cheeks/jawline area… but after using this 3 times i have found that my forehead and other spots on my face where i dont get the most breakouts (nose, chin, hairline,) suddenly have have a bunch of small bumps and a few large pimples that actually hurt. \nSince this is the only new product i have introduced into my routine, and i have had the same routine for about the past 4 months, I know the cause is this moisturizer. I feel that it is probably the shea butter in this cream, so if you have acne prone skin i wouldnt try this out. But it is a really good price and if you have normal to dry skin i think it would be a great fit for you, however my acne girlies try to stay away. giving 2 stars because the formula is really nice i just wish it would have worked out with my skin. i know you have to give skin products some time before they work but since this is a moisturizer,  and with all my experience with different skin products… my face is saying otherwise. sorry good molecules i still love you!",
