I have been using it for months, and still have a lot left, a little goes a long way. My skin looks great, My trips for skin treatments have extended so technically spending a little more on this upfront has saved me a ton long term!

My pores are visibly smaller and my complexion looks healthier. I can't wait to see what my face will look like at the end of 4 weeks. Just a little dab will cover your face. This is well worth the money.",

The Renergie Night cream that I currently use now is nothing as compared to High Resolution night cream that I have told all my friends and family to buy",
