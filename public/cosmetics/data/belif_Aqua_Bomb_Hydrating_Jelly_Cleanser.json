I love the smell and find it immensely refreshing. I bought this in March of last year and I'm still using the same bottle. I was out of town a few times and used one of the trial sizes then, but still despite the fact that this is a little bit expensive, it certainly lasted and worth the money. I do occasionally need to wash my face twice but I do not consider that much of a drawback considering how little needs to be used and how gentle it is.￼ I also occasionally use a stronger cleanser if my face feels extra grubby.￼ It's a fantastic product and I would be interested if Belif had a shower gel/body cleanser.￼",

My skin was loving it..until recently. Something in the new batches of these products is different. After purchasing new in both those items, my skin has become red, inflamed, itchy and just over all ticked off. I don't know what happened. They must have changed ingredients slightly, I'm not certain. I am certain that I will no longer be purchasing Belif products and will be switching back over to Murad.",

Was so disappointed that the full size item seemed to be a completely different formula and even smelled different. It also doesn't do much when it comes to acne or any breakouts. The sample I had smelled amazing and slightly citrusy, left a refreshing and clean feeling. The full size product smells like nothing and doesn't feel refreshing or clean. Incredibly underwhelming and disappointed with this. I wanted to love it so bad. Won't be purchasing again especially for the huge price tag on this. Not worth the money in the slightest.",

This product is one of the only face cleansers that don't overly dry out my face, treats my sensitive skin well, and helps prevent more breakouts.  It has a light orange scent and lathers well.  When I use my hands to wash, I always make sure to work jelly cleansers like this into a good lather first before washing my face, I feel like the foam penetrates the skin a little more and breaks down leftover oil cleanser, dirt and grime, and sebum.  When I use Aqua Bomb cleanser with my Clarisonic cleansing brush, my face feels super clean afterwards, like I FEEL the clean on the skin and it's just so nice especially after a long day at work.",

Was so disappointed that the full size item seemed to be a completely different formula and even smelled different. It also doesn't do much when it comes to acne or any breakouts. The sample I had smelled amazing and slightly citrusy, left a refreshing and clean feeling. The full size product smells like nothing and doesn't feel refreshing or clean. Incredibly underwhelming and disappointed with this. I wanted to love it so bad. Won't be purchasing again especially for the huge price tag on this. Not worth the money in the slightest.",
