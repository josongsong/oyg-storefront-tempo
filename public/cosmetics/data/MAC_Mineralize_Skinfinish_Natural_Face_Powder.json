Gone is the silky finish left behind  from the previous version, leaving in its place a flat, dull canvas instead. \n\nMAC used to be a superior, industry leader in face/foundation oroducts, aming other things, however the quality has descended into something that is no longer competitive.

But Tiktok influenced me to try a shade that was recommended by makeup artists for fair skin and its the perf shade. I feel the pictures/shades online are misrepresented for the actual color of the product. I got shade Medium Tan and it looks so orange online but in person its really a neutral tan and is lighter in color. I suggest going in-store and swatching so you dont need to keep buying diff shades online like i did. Unfortunately, my ulta is always out of stock in store for this product is almost everyshade. I like that this is a baked product and it gives a sheerness of color you can build. Overall i recommend because the quality is great",

This is high coverage (the actual coverage is great the consistency is beautiful) but with just a few swipes from my brush it covered so much. The Charlotte Tilbury is going to be better and MUCH more natural. This powder in place of a foundation could however be an option for something slightly natural, but it does come out extremely patchy. I've had to restart my clients after this product likes to really clump up.",

I went to my local counter and was first matched to medium deep, however prior to purchase the employee advised that I get the dark. She applied it and at the store it looked great. I made my purchase and noticed after time it oxidized and it looked like I had a beautiful Hershey's chocolate glow all over my face. Though the color was pretty it didn't match me at all. I was really shocked because in the container it seemed to be a great match. I went back the next day and got the original color match medium deep. It looks light in the container but it is truly the perfect oxidation for my complexion. I wear it both with just concealer, and to set my Match Masters 7.0 foundation. I always get compliments whenever I wear it. So this is worth it you just have to find your correct match. I only gave it four stars because of the difficulty to find the perfect shade can be a little tricky.\n\nI like the mirror compact its sleek, however you have to be careful when opening it. I think the bottom should have a small puff for touch ups since the mirror is there, but I must admit I'm a dry skin girl and once I place this on with a big powder brush it stays put. Overall beautiful finish, and this a great product!",

I've got combination skin with T-zone being EXTREMLY oily (half an hour of make up and my nose becomes a waterfall of oil). Its not even T-zone its JUST my nose. This powder the texture and look of it is GORGEOUS. I got matched with Medium Dark and it looks good first 10 minutes but then it oxidises like crazy and it ends up being three shades darker. I use it almost as a bronzer because its waaaaay too dark so beaware.. the colour may LOOK right on your skin in the beginning but as the day goes on it changes colour. For people with dry skin i think this would be amazing. The powder is sooO soft and it gives an instant glow and radiance to my face (it doesn't cover anything). It would be amazing if the colour suited i would use it over my make up for the glow however as for staying power for people with skin like mine this wouldn't be enough as a setting powder. I tend to use it directly after makeup and not sure if this \"glow\" contributes to my skin looking extra oily afterwards or not but I'm going to be sticking to my select sheer pressed powder for now. This was an alternative cos I wanted to try something new but am definitely going back to that. Mineralise Skin Finish Natural is very light and feathery and isn't as heavy as select sheer but for staying power and controlling my oils this definitely doesn't do the trick :(",
