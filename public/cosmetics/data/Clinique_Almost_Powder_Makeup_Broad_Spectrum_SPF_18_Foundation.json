It used to be more of a creamy powder with good and buildable coverage, now it is extremely loose powder and sheer almost no coverage and goes on splotchy! It barely even goes on my brush it just turns in to a loose powdery mess on the compact! So disappointing! My favorite foundation powder that worked so well for so long has been ruined! Now I have to start over and try to find something new. I think I will try bare minerals pressed foundation powder and hope it works for me.",

        "comments": "I'm 45, and a minimal makeup person. I have dry, mature skin with some fine lines and a few deeper wrinkles. \n\nOver the years I have tried several powders; the hyped Laura Mercier, Lancôme, Tillbury, MAC, to name a few. They always either desiccated my skin, clung to hairs and dry patches, left me feeling tight, ended up looking cakey. Really, I feel the same about most liquid foundations I've tried, too, with a few rare exceptions. \n\nI just want something natural, easy, long wearing and most importantly, something that plays well with sunscreen. I bought this powder on a whim with the lowest possible expectations. \n\nI love it. I bought back ups. Easy to apply rolling it on with the provided sponge. Goes on super well over sunscreen or moisturizer. Doesn't suck all the moisture from my skin, doesn't cling to fine hairs, settle in fine lines, doesn't transfer onto clothing. The look it provides is a smoothed, blurred skin tone - very natural. I have some redness, a few freckles, some scars that are a different color, some capillaries, and a few sunspots. This powder just ties everything together and gives my skin a more even appearance. I spray a little humectant toner over the the top to hydrate the finish and I'm good to go. Lasts all day. The compact will last a year using it every day, which helps with the high price. It's easy to carry with you, no mess, no brush needed. \n\nApparently there are a lot of silicones and emollients in the formula which helps so much to make this not a drying powder. I love it so much. I threw away my other coverage products. I can't imagine anything working better than this.",

I can't wear foundation of any kind with out it wearing off my face in an oil slick causing break outs. Or the colors are never a match. Powders, expensive and generic make my face feel tight and uncomfortable, again not providing a good color match.  I have large pores, redness all over and am acne prone in my T-Zone area.  A co-worker was wearing the Almost powder by Clinic. Her face was glowing after a long shift at work. Her makeup flawless. She told me to give Clinic a try. The best decision I've made. You can apply this liberally for a lightweight coverage or you can build with this to get medium to full coverage.  All the redness in my face was covered perfectly. Acne has deminished and no new breakouts. The color match is perfect. It feels light weight with out the the tighness of a powder but finishes like a foundation through out the day.  It's price point may be higher than drug store. I'd say save the money you'd spend on drug store foundations and powders and get this instead.  Clinic almost powder will make me feel confident in the summer.",

It is so frustrating for a company to change a foundation, a powder, that it knows from reviews that IS ABSOLUTELY WORKING for those who use it! The coverage, look and feel is now different than what it used to be because you took out the SPF15 that was in the product. HOWEVER...You might check your stores as many I went to in my local area have the samples to try the product at the counter, say the SPF! I used to love the coverage of this powder as I typcially and almost exclusively use powder as my foundation at the age of 51! Please change this back to the way it was!!",
