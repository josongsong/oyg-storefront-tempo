I love the color the Big O changed to on my lips, it's a really gorgeous yet natural pink color. Provides a slight tingling sensation with a light plumping effect and feels moisturizing…. Whether it will ends up drying in the long run is yet to be determined. For now, I'd definitely recommend.",

I'm very fair and don't usually opt for a bold lip, and this product seemed like a nice light pink, which it is for one swipe. If you reapply this it does get more and more pink. I saw myself after a night out of reapplication and felt like a kid who found their moms lipstick in the 80s. Its addicting to use though because the formula is fanastic, really smooth and a little minty. I've started to use this on my cheecks as a blush and blending it out with a brush and its gorgeous. It's a much better blush than lip product for my personal preference.",

I see a lot of reviews saying it's \"not true to color\" or it turned their lips a certain color but the description clearly says \" A unique reactor works with your individual PH level to transform your lips into your most flattering custom shade of pink.\" I actually loved the shade of pink it turned my lips because I wasn't expecting the pink you see on the applicator. This product gives a slight tingle sensation without being overbearing. I always like to have something on my lips so this is a great alternative to lipstick or chap stick and gives the right amount of slight pigment while looking natural.",

It's like a giant tube of chap stick.\nIt's moisturizing and leaves a slight tingly feel. At first I liked the color it left but at times when I put it on it turns my lips a bright, 80's hot pink. Not cute. I expected it to be more subtle than that - a natural pink that plays off your natural coloring.",
