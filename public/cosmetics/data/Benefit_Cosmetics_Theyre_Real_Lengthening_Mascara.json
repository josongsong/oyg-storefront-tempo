I found out that my boyfriend who I was going to marry cheated on me, so I cried for nearly 7 hours one day with this mascara on. To my shock, this mascara was still in place and only smudged a little bit. And when I say I cried, I mean I was in fetal position on the ground...and this mascara still held up. So y'all, go buy this thing because I will forever swear by it and if I could marry it, I would. Cause we all know it would be more faithful than my man could ever be. Solid 10/10",

My friend did like the look, but I like it when my eyelashes look long AND full. If you try to layer it, it just clumps up.\nI even put They're Real on one eye and the CoverGirl on the other eye and asked a GUY at work which was better and he said, without a doubt, the CoverGirl eye was just as long but much more volume. So don't waste your money.",
