I wear black eyeliner and mascara every single day, and when I have special occasions or something to go to, I have pretty heavy eye makeup on. This will turn into an oil in literally 2 seconds when you rub it and it does just what it says, melts off your makeup! It helps because you don't have any harsh rubbing that will damage your delicate eye skin. After I use this, I just take my makeup remover cloth and wipe it away! Tada! You're done! Then I just cleanse as normal! If you've been wanting to try a remover balm, this is a good one to start with for the price!",

My face is now covered in painful cystic acne and closed comedones. At first I attributed it to trying out some different mental health meds, but then realized this was the culprit. Too bad I was 3/4 through with it and way too far into wrecking my face. It's full of lots of pore clogging ingredients, including coconut oil. I should've been more careful and looked at the ingredients first, but I usually feel pretty good about Neutrogena products. My face is completely destroyed and I'm so mortified. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",
