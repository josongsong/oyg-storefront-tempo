        "comments": "I've been really impressed by this primer so far! I have an oily T zone, and live in an area that can get hot and humid, and work 12 hr shifts. All that translates into an essentially neverending search for products that look good, feel good, and hold up to the harsh conditions. 😂  \n\nThis is one of two primers I've ever tried that noticeably extend the wear time of my makeup (and that other primer is no longer produced, of course). Not sure what's up with some of the reviews commenting on a horrific smell (maybe an odd bad batch, or expired product?), but to me, the product has no scent at all. Imediately upon application, the product feels moisturizing, but with spreading/rubbing it, it turns tacky-feeling. Hence the \"Hydro Grip\" name.\n\nI will say that the tackiness is not a pleasant sensation for me, but knowing it serves a purpose helps (plus, it really isn't noticeable after makeup is applied). Personally, I like the velvet feel and blurring effect of primers with a creamy whipped texture. Expecting a pilling disaster, I tried mixing the Iconic London Velvet Smooth primer with the Milk Hydro Grip primer - and was pleasantly shocked that I got my Goldilocks \"just right\" primer. Hydrating, pore blurring, and makeup gripping.",

It works great and makes your makeup hold up good, but if you have acne prone skin I would suggest staying away from this and finding a primer made for acne prone skin.  I started using this and began to breakout, more than usual and I can say the only thing that has changed is which primer I was using so this was the culprit... I have discontinued use and went back to my old primer and my skin is clearing up.  It's a good primer just not the best for those who's skin is prone to acne in my opinion.",

I got a sample size of the milk hydro grip primer to try and I was really excited because I love milk makeup and there's a lot of hype around this primer. Its very light weight and absorbs into the skin quickly. It does leave behind a tacky feeling which helps to grip your makeup and hold it in place. I did notice that it doesnt play very well with the tatcha silk canvas primer. I like to use a pore filling primer in my t zone and when the two of these mixed they started to pill but it wasn't super bad and I was still able to use them together. It just took a little extra work. It does feel hydrating and it definitely grips makeup. I wore a full face glam all day and my base did not budge which is a fiat for me. I have an oily t zone and usually after a couple hours my makeup is slipping and sliding but not with this primer underneath. I do want to find a way to use a pore primer with it. But it's ok. Ive tried it with a coupe different foundations powders and concealer and I had the same results each time. This is a great gripping primer! When I use this I know that I can trust my base makeup. I really enjoyed this",

        "comments": "I received a sample of this, so I wanted to try it today. I will say that I am unimpressed. I have oily/normal skin with a touch of rosacea, and I use a variety of powder makeup. Today I am in Bare Minerals, which typically works fine with most of my primers. This, however, I do not like. It's been hours since I did my makeup this morning, and I still feel it on my skin. The way my skin feels, I want to wash it all off and start over with a different primer. I don't find it to be hydrating in the least, my face just feels like it needs to be cleaned. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone I know.",
