        "comments": "These patches have saved me when I needed them. I'm a 28 year old male, and I don't usually struggle with dark circles because I've maintained my skin through skincare, fitness, and hydration since I was a young teen, but when I'm short on sleep, the puffiness and shadows show up FAST. \n\nThe caffeine hydrogel formula is extremely hydrating and gives me a noticeable, immediate lift. My under-eyes look smoother, brighter, and less puffy right after removal. What I appreciate the most is how well-engineered the formula feels. It's clean with useful ingredients that actually do something instead of fillers. The instructions are very straightforward, though I do wish they'd specify placement more clearly. In the end though, I switch up the placement of the patches depending on my mood and still get the same results, as long as I cover the affected area.\n\nI usually layer it with the Yerba Mate Wake Up Eye Gel and it's AMAZING. All my friends have asked if I've had injections because the area looks so refreshed. This is a repeat purchase for me, and I've already started gifting it to friends. If you want fast, visible de-puffing with real hydration, this should be part of your arsenal.",

And, let me tell you the results are outstanding! The difference between under eye skin and facial skin (cheeks) is incredibly noticeable; in a great way. It has made my under eye area SOOOO much smoother, brighter and tighter. I wish they made a face mask; I used one every night...hint hint wink wink!!! Not only did I notice a difference so did the man and the kids on different days (no, they didn't tell one another to say something). But, I am shocked! The results are amazing and consistency is key!!! \nps- other products used along side with kiehls avocado eye cream and RoC hydration serum. After I took off the patches I put a full ringfinger tip amount of serum, split between each eye and allowed to that soak in a bit and then applied a thin yet thicker, a nice amount of eye cream under each eye and allowed that soak in on itself. Amazing",

I tried them out because I love love good modecules hyaluronic acid serum that I use all the time, and to my surprise never had a reaction to the serum with my sensitive skin. Back to the patches, directions said to cleanse then dry and then apply the patches for 5–10 minutes. Patches went on easily and had a cooling effect at first but not even two minutes later I start to feel a tingling sensation and when I looked in the mirror under my eyes are bright red and swollen. I had to ice my face and wait for a while for the reaction to go away. Completely disappointed in this product and shame on me for not reading the reviews beforehand. Lesson learned.",

The 'slimy' feel is normal…like any hydrogel patch. \n-They stay put on your face & are very hydrating. \nI can't say anything about de-puffing, because it isn't an issue I have to a bothersome extent, but it certainly smooths out the area & tones just a teeny tiny bit. \n-The shape fit fine under my eyes with a little moulding. It's VERY…very obvious which way you're supposed to apply them to your face lol. \n\nAnyway…point is, after reading all these terrible reviews in the Ulta parking lot after purchase, I was afraid to open the jar; but I'm pleasantly surprised & will continue to finish out this product. Might even buy em' again.",

Judging by the other positive reviews I believe this product works, but I am just not the target user. My dark circles are likely hereditary and my under eye area is not puffy. I've never noticed any positive benefits when using this product so I stopped reaching for it. I find the patches hard to keep in place, and I have to rinse off the product after use because even if it's been hours after removal, the residue causes pilling in my makeup or moisturizer. Not to mention products like this are quite wasteful. So I would not recommend to someone who has hereditary dark circles and doesn't experience puffiness.",
