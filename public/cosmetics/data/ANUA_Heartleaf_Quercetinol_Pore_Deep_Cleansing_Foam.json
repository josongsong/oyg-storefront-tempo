Firstly, i only have to use a small amount and lathered it up so when I started to massage my face, you could FEEL it starting to work. I have rare moments of little blisters that form under one or both of my eyes and some were already forming this morning. I remembered I purchased the cleanser yesterday and put it on. I could feel it tingly on my face and especially on the small red blisters. By this afternoon 1pm, the blisters have already minimized and/or gone from my face. The redness is gone and my pores have also minimized. Mind you, this is from ONE wash. I cannot wait to see how this product will work after a week of use. I'm not crazy for the smell but it is not too strong and somewhat decent. Will definitely be using this product again! I also have dry skin and my face feels hydrated and soft stilk from this morning's wash. 10/10 recommend!",

I got this cleanser to use not everyday but whenever i need a deeper cleanse/exfoliation. I really like it. I feel like i get a good deep clean without it feeling super harsh. It is definitely a product i cant use everyday. I have a good moisturizing routine and i think that is the only reason i can use this. If i didnt have that it would definitely be too harsh on my sensitive skin. Overall i do like this product and it feels like a good addition to my routine 1-2x a week.",

When I first tried it, my skin felt a little tingly when I was foaming it up on my face. I didn't think anything of it sonce some actives do that. But a week after using this cleanser, I started breaking out in painful pimples (mostly white heads but a few cysts) all over my face. I also noticed that the product was separating, so green, oily liquid would come out with it. \nOverall, I dont think this product is suitable for sensitive or acne-prone skin.",

I initially expected a liquid formula, but it turned out to have a thick, scrub-like texture instead. It immediately reminded me of the classic Apricot Scrub, a cult favorite.\n\nBecause of its thick consistency, I had to work it into my skin to create a lather. To my delight, the process was incredibly relaxing. I'm not sure if this was the brand's intent, but the entire 3-step routine felt like an at-home aesthetician appointment.\n\nI started by oil cleansing with the Anua Heartleaf and gave my skin a few minutes to react before moving to this face wash. When I first dispensed the product, I regretted oil cleansing beforehand, as I realized I'd essentially be double-exfoliating.\n\nTo my surprise, the face wash lathered beautifully, just like a traditional foaming cleanser. This also meant that a little went a long way—just a pea-sized amount was enough to cleanse my entire face and neck.\n\nI massaged it in for about 60 seconds, following the \"60-second rule\" to ensure my skin thoroughly absorbed the product without irritation. Since this was my first time trying it, I was cautious, as skin often takes time to adjust to new products.\n\nOverall, the process was a joy. Moving forward, I'd likely use this face wash on its own, skipping the oil cleanser unless I'm wearing makeup. Double cleansing is a must for removing makeup, but doing so unnecessarily can strip your skin of its natural oils.\n\nI'm excited to see the results of consistent use over the next month. I'm hoping for clear, plump, and healthy-looking skin!",

        "comments": "Even though this cleansing foam leaves you feeling refreshed and also rejuvenated,  I have to state that it is not good for sensitive skin. I looked at the ingredients and decided to give it a shot and had high hopes. However, my acne got so bad that I almost didn't want to leave the house, I was so embarrassed. I have had to use rubbing alcohol,  which seems to be the only thing to control my acne, but I've had to dry my skin out incredibly and basically reverse what this product did just so I could get rid of the acne. However, this is a fun product. I enjoyed making a foam and giving myself a mask. I felt super refreshed by the feel and the smell and calming affect it left before it made me break out. If you enjoy peppermint smells, almost like tea tree, then this is the perfect skincare line for you.",
