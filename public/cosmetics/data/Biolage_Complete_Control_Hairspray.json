I tend to just grab whatever. This actually makes me realize I need to pay more attention to my finishing products. It has the signature smell of Biolage without a strong scent of alcohol. It's light enough to hold down frizz without looking glued down, but also strong enough to hold my \"I'm going this way\" bangs in place where they should be. I've already used this more in the few weeks I've had it than the other hairspray that's been in my cabinet for a year. This is something I will most definitely buy myself after trying it. I have medium texture, thin hair and this works great for me. I think it would also work great for fine hair since it's so effective with my flyaways. I don't know that it's Beauty Pageant strong, but it's not making that claim anyways. I am surprised by how much I use this and for those looking for a good every day hairspray, this is definitely where you should start.",
