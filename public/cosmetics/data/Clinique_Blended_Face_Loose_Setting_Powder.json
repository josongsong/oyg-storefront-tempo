I ran out so I decided to replace it for what I already had in my cabinet which was MAC pressed powder - it was fine for my face but by lunch time it was noticeably settled in my top and bottom eye creases, then I tried bareMinerals, my favorite for my face! And the same! It settled in my top and bottom eye creases ugh! And I'm not about to add primero or any extra steps to my basic everyday work makeup routine, so I repurchased clinique loose powder and voilà no creasing, simple and easy is what I need! Thank you Clinique!",
