        "comments": "Love this spray and it works beautifully when the humidity is under about 60% . I like that i can spray it in before styling because the himidity in the bathroom while blow drying has reverted my roots. THAT SAID- to hold a natural roller set or flatiron outside perfectly, thi MUST be paired with Kenra 26. That hairspray is the truth but it IS a lil sticky. So, if you can get away with one do it. My hair is fine and doesnt like a ton of product but it does well with this. No flaking, no stickiness, no weightiness. When I add on the Kenra 26 it takes me sown from 4-5 day to 3-4 days that I can wear my hair down without it feeling oily and dirty - with a new rollerset in day 3 it will last but these two together are the TRUTH.",

Best defense is a good hair product like Kenra anti humidity spray. I use this product before using my normal hairspray and my hair stays tame throughout the day, even under the elements. The spray is very light, not sticky or stiff. Very good fragrance from the spray, smells like a salon spray. Premium product for your worst frizz!",

Amazingly, nothing.  Still had humidity halo frizz.  Although I did not want any 'hold', there was absolutely no hold whatsoever.  Thought at least some hold might do something, but NOPE, just added alcohol to my hair for no reason - yuck and potentially drying.  And it really likes to spray everywhere, in a haze.  Usually like Kenra products, just not this one.  Gave it two stars because it smells absolutely wonderful, like a mild Lily of the Valley.",
