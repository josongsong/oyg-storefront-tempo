Lancôme suggests La Base Pro Perfecting Makeup Primer. Using a makeup brush, beauty blender tool (use wet for even more coverage) or fingers, apply Rénergie Lift Makeup Foundation onto skin for desired coverage.

Lancôme's products are organized by both intensity (I, II, III, IV, V) and by undertone (C, N, W.)Intensity:The intensity of a Lancôme product is organized by surface skin color.Hues are organized by Intensity I, Intensity II, Intensity III, Intensity IV and Intensity V.Undertones:Cool (C) undertones = foundations and powders look slightly pinkish. Bare skin has a rosy undertone and usually burns easily in the sun. Veins appear blue.Neutral (N) undertones = bare skin is a bit more even toned, not too pink or too golden. These usually work best for olive skin/olive undertones (\"\"green\"\"), but it is still best to test out first on skin for the perfect match! Veins appear a mix of green and blue.Warm (W) undertones = bare skin appears golden/yellow and tans easily in the sun. Olive skin can sometimes skew warm as well for those with a slightly more gold hue. Veins appear green.How-To Find The Best Powder And Foundation For You:Example 1: If surface skin tone is Intensity III (3) - this is usually a medium/tan surface skin tone - and at the Lancôme counter 335W, 340N and 350C are all a match, then use the W, N and C as a guide to find the perfect match. Meaning, if 340N in this scenario blends in perfectly, but a more deeper shade is preferred, then go a shade deeper in the 355(C) or 370 III (C).Example 2: If surface skin tone is Intensity I (1) - this is usually a light/fair surface skin tone - and at the Lancôme counter 110C, 130N and 140N are all a match, using the W, N, and C can guide to the perfect match. This means, if 130N in this scenario blends in perfectly, but it feels too pink, then go a shade deeper and warmer (W).Lancôme is diverse for all women, of all ethnic backgrounds, nationalities and skin types.Shipping & Coupon RestrictionsThis brand is excluded from most Ulta Beauty coupons.See brand eligibility details",

        "comments": "I like the product, but not for the price, because the lid always breaks. The lid needs to be revamped. I have purchased this product twice, and each time the plastic stays within the lid (the ones that hold the lid on) have broken. Hence, the lid doesn't stay on anymore, making it risky business to throw in a makeup bag or to travel with it for fear of the nozzle inadvertently getting pushed, squirting foundation all over everything, and creating a royal mess. Lancome won't send you a new lid if you don't have a timely issue. So bottom line is, be aware, if you purchase this product, the lid WILL break. In my humble opinion, this foundation is WAY too expensive to have such a cheap, unreliable closure.",

        "comments": "I have used this foundation for years and recommended to so many. As I feared when I learned the original formula and container we're being discontinued I was concerned. This has happened so many times to produce I love. First the bottle is terrible. The top will not stay on. The original bottle was smooth and nice to hold. This one is sharp and unattractive. The pump distributes too much product. The texture seems off as well and my shade in the new one has more if a pink tone. I just don't understand when a company has a product obviously loved by so many they change it.",
