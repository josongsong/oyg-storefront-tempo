I will be repurchase these. I do like Pixie patches, and was just wondering what other patches do and feel and if results were any different. Do I think there is any HUGE improvements from any under eye patches, no, none of them are miracle workers. But these patches are definitely 10/10. Thank you for making eye patches that DONT MOVE!!!",
