        "comments": "Does not function properly as a lip gloss. The glossy aspect of this product, at least for the color I got, Cream de Cacao, is like an oil with pigment that does not go on evenly. You can manipulate it to even it out but it does not stay that way because it absorbs into the lips. It moisturizes I suppose, but no shine is left, and it absorbs quickly, within an hour. There is pigment left behind on the lips but not the color Cream de Cacao promises. Its like a bright/medium pink instead of its initial light pink. Very strange product, could maybe be marketed as an oil stain, but I am disappointed in this as a lip gloss.",

However, just like the volumizing gloss sticks, the pigment only lasted an hour on my lips, without a liner or lipstick….. whats the point of this product if we cant wear it alone ? Despite it being highly pigmented, it was so blotchy and that was a turn off for me. For the 3 hours i had it on, i didnt eat nor drink anything at all, and yet the color not only vanished, it ran out the corners of my lips and had me looking crazy. I wish most people would give honest reviews after using a product for a while, rather than try it on for no more than 30 minutes and run to make reviews asap. The colors are beautiful and pigmented but just dont last long on plain lips.",
