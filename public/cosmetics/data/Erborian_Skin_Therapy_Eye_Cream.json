        "comments": "The skin around my eyes is particularly delicate, and I've noticed that with prolonged use, my under-eye area feels significantly more resilient by morning.   The Skin Therapy Eye Cream has a wonderfully whipped texture, and you only need a small amount, about the size of a grain of rice. Its excellent spreadability ensures that it smooths and deeply hydrates the eye area without feeling greasy. Despite how nourishing it is, the cream surprisingly feels lightweight.  Like other Erborian products, something magical happens when this cream comes into contact with the skin—it becomes richer and absorbs beautifully. I love waking up to brighter, smoother, and more hydrated eyes, with noticeably reduced dark circles.",
