Try this brand out!!! I've tried MANY, and I think I'll be sticking around this brand < 3",

        "comments": "Having combo skin (more on the oily side) I had always opted for cleansers that stripped away all my natural oils to feel \"clean\" but little did I know back then that's the worst thing you can do for oily skin. Since I found Blume products, my skin has never looked better. I love how natural the ingredients are and no harsh chemicals are used. My face feels clean and supple, not stripped and dry like most cleansers. It creates a healthy balance and I have WAYYYY less breakouts than before. I used to have uncontrollable cystic acne around my chin that drastically improved after using this brand and now I rarely ever have them. If I do I use the Melt Down and it really helps. Battling oily skin by stripping away the oil is such a no go. I'm so happy I found this product and learned how to actually care for my skin. Please don't ever stop making this!! I'm already torn up that Stargirl is no longer available!",

Once the bottle is over half gone, it becomes impossible to pump out any more product so you end up taking out the pump and pounding the bottle into your palm for the next week until it's gone. I've been using this cleanser for a few years and really hoped they would have fixed this problem by now as many other reviewers have complained about the same thing.",

It is a non-sudsy consistency, so it doesn't necessarily give me that \"squeaky-clean\" feeling, but it feels nice & gentle. I have skin that is sensitive to some medicated cleansers that have salicylic acid in them, so my skin tends to dry out and get irritated with some everyday cleansers. But not this one! This leaves my skin feeling nice & not stripped of its natural oils. The formula is really gentle. My skin has not been dry since using this. Will continue to use!",

If you are also looking for a cream cleanser, this is a nice one! it cleans nicely without stripping and I love the subtle lavender scent. \nMy only complaint is I wish they have a bigger bottle.\nps: for cream cleansers, you need to use more products than a foaming cleanser(usually I use 2-3 pumps). and you need to double cleanse in the PM (that's like 6-9 pumps per day), thus a 4oz cream cleanser doesn't really last very long. given the price and how much product it has, I think the Philosophy Purity Cleanser(also a cream cleanser) has a much better value (32oz for MSRP$59 and they have BOGO a few times a year)",

I've been using everything for about two weeks now so not a long enough time for me to truly review how they benefit my skin long term, but short term, they've been fantastic. I've got extremely oily skin and am prone to breakouts (especially when I'm under a lot of stress) and so far, I'm not noticing any additional breakouts, which is great (it's been a huge concern of mine in the past when even thinking of switching products; I've been very happy with the products - that took forever for me to find - that kept my breakouts at bay and have always been very hesitant to stop using them, but I have since using Blume. Whirl gives my skin a very dewy look - I'm trying to get used to it because while it looks healthy, I equate that with oil for my skin. My skin has been soft and glowing. And I LOVE how the products smell.  We'll see if I still rate this 5 stars after a few months of use, especially in the summer with humidity and heat (I'm definitely concerned how the dewy look I'm rocking through the winter will end up looking horrid in the summer).",

Daydreamer was a dream come true in Toronto's cold dry winter weather, I used it religiously for 4 months & my skin was so happy with Daydreamer, Stargirl mist & my moisturizer. However. I've been in Jamaica & Trinidad & Tobago for 2 months now, and my skin hasn't broken out this badly ever. My skin was so healthy & clear using Daydreamer in a cold climate, so once I arrived in the Caribbean I changed nothing. Worst idea ever. I now understand what some of the other reviewers are saying about this feeling like sunscreen or some weird thick lotion. In the heat it leaves a super sticky, gross film of residue on my face. I realized after less than a week of use that I needed to switch up my skincare routine, as continuing to use Daydreamer was creating cystic acne unlike anything I've ever experienced, also in areas I never get pimples. I was breaking out on my chin & cheeks & forehead - even my temples & around my lips had cystic pimples! SO bad. I've spent plenty of time in tropical climates my whole life & never had a problem with breakouts in the heat. First I cut out stargirl thinking maybe that was the problem. Nope. My skin continued to get worse. I've stopped using Daydreamer for about 6 weeks & my skin is clearing up...... now I'll just have to figure out how to fade the new acne scars all over my face. I'm scared to try daydreamer again in any climate after what it did to my face. Canceling my Auto-renew subscription. So sad cause I thought I'd found the perfect cleanser for my dry skin. Pic is of the remaining scars & bumps caused by this cleanser, one month later. I didn't take any pics of my face at its worst.",
