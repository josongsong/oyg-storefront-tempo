        "comments": "I saw bad reviews for this that would've discouraged me from buying had I not been using this product for years. But I honestly think it boils down to skin type & how you use your make up. \n\nIt works well for me, lasts me a long time (I don't wear make up daily) I have combination skin. In the summer I can get pretty oily & in the winter can get pretty dry. I'm also no make up guru. I like quick, simple & natural looking. I think most people complaining are trying to contour & layer & this seems this isn't for that. I personally like that it sets quick bc I have other stuff to do & don't want it coming of. I also use one pump & pat forehead, both cheeks & chin, pat all over while wet, no issues. With the concealer drying quicker too my blemish is covered by the time I come back with my foundation vs some watered down options you have to reconceal 2-3 times. I can also pat my blush & matte powder to keep my forehead from shining no problem. I use eyeshadow very rarely & if you're about anything caking…just use less. It's pretty thick. I have some bad scars & it covers me fine with 1 pump, it goes a long way. \n\nReminder, pretty sure you can test at Ulta. Make sure you washed, moisturized & exfoliated for best results. Hope this helps!\n\nSo if you want quick, simple coverage, your skin is hydrated, exfoliated & you're okay with patting vs brushing & lots of layering it's a good option imo.",

        "comments": "I saw bad reviews for this that would've discouraged me from buying had I not been using this product for years. But I honestly think it boils down to skin type & how you use your make up. \n\nIt works well for me, lasts me a long time (I don't wear make up daily) I have combination skin. In the summer I can get pretty oily & in the winter can get pretty dry. I'm also no make up guru. I like quick, simple & natural looking. I think most people complaining are trying to contour & layer & this seems this isn't for that. I personally like that it sets quick bc I have other stuff to do & don't want it coming of. I also use one pump & pat forehead, both cheeks & chin, pat all over while wet, no issues. With the concealer drying quicker too my blemish is covered by the time I come back with my foundation vs some watered down options you have to reconceal 2-3 times. I can also pat my blush & matte powder to keep my forehead from shining no problem. I use eyeshadow very rarely & if you're about anything caking…just use less. It's pretty thick. I have some bad scars & it covers me fine with 1 pump, it goes a long way. \n\nReminder, pretty sure you can test at Ulta. Make sure you washed, moisturized & exfoliated for best results. Hope this helps!\n\nSo if you want quick, simple coverage, your skin is hydrated, exfoliated & you're okay with patting vs brushing & lots of layering it's a good option imo.",

        "comments": "I wanted to love this so much, queen Ri released one of the most inclusive concealer lines on the market. \nMy problem with the concealer:\n-It cracks and dries over moisturizer and especially sunscreen. I will do my entire face and add fenty concealer and around my eyes it cracks and separates, and looks like I have flaky skin, just terrible! I've tried mineral SPF, liquid SPF drops, water based moisturizer, oil based moisturizer… i figured it may be something to do with the formula. Doesn't work with anything, and I am not leaving the house without SPF :/ \n-the shades oxidize, do a patch and wear test in store (1hr) before buying or you'll get the wrong color. \n-expensive for what you get \n-looks cakey and when I have an odd blemish I will try to cover it and it just CLINGS to the blemish making it obvious there's a blemish and makes the skin crusty and gross.",
