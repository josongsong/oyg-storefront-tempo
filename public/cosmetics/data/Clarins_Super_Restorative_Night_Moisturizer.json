I was looking for a night-time moisturizer to add to my skincare routine, and just with this sample-size, I saw results in just 4 days. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and plump in the morning without feeling oily. The scent is nice and subtle, and it actually is very similar to Fenty's Hydra Vizor Moisturizer scent, but just a little less potent in scent (which I prefer) and more lightweight. The moisturizer is smooth to touch on my hands and when applying to my skin. With this, I'd say a little goes a long way, which is great because it's definitely on the pricier side. I'm 32 and I highly recommend this product if you want to be preventive and/or just looking for a night-time moisturizer to add to your skincare.",

This specific night cream is just disappointing, the product texture is good n light but the fragrance is overwhelming and overly scented. I am so reluctant to use it at night as I also have to take care of my baby and scared it is too much scent for him. Common Clarins you can do better and start using actual customer and not celebrity to test your product.",
