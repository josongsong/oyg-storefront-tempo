I used this product along with the Tula facewash and moisturizer because the Tula toner burned my skin. Let me tell you, this product works amazingly!! I saw results very quickly within the first couple of uses. I usually use this once to twice a day and it has been great. It leaves my skin feeling bright, fresh, and smooth. I think that it has also helped my acne and scars clear drastically. DONT GIVE UP! I almost did on skin care routines because nothing worked throughout high school, work, pregnancy, and years of trying different products. I even went to a dermatologist and nothing worked. This product has helped me feel so much more confident. The only thing is it does feel slightly sticky to the touch when applied but i like the feeling because oddly enough its like a smooth clean sticky.(Lol if that makes sense) some might find it annoying but i kind of like it, and it goes away quickly.

I bought several Good Molecules items, and nothing worked for me. \n\nThis toner sat on my skin for hours, sticky to the touch, which meant it was only good at night. I tried using it in the morning and blotting with a tissue to solve the stickiness, but then my face looked too shiny unless I covered it up with a matte foundation or powder. I had this same issue with the niacinamide toner (which I only used once before discontinuing). \n\nI also have mild rosacea (flushed skin rather than breakouts), and after using this product for two weeks, I was receiving comments that my face looked more red than before. That's when I finally gave up. \n\nWhile the redness issue is more on me, I'm surprised there's not one other person among these 168 reviews who felt the product was unabsorbent. Maybe I got a bad batch?",
