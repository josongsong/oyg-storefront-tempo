I also love how hydrating it is. My skin feels plump and moisturized all day, and it doesn't settle into fine lines or dry patches. Plus, knowing it's made with 94% naturally-derived ingredients like hyaluronic acid and squalane makes me feel even better about using it daily. Gifted by hourglass",

        "comments": "I have combination/oily skin but I love hydrating products because they don't accentuate my smile lines as much as mattifying products do. I recently got into skin tints as I am getting older and the cakey look isn't my thing anymore. I like looking more natural with a healthy complexion. This was gifted to me by Hourglass Cosmetics. First of all, this tint doesn't have much pigment so you can't expect even medium coverage specially if like me, you have dark spots. It is very light and has little coverage. However, I love it for myself as an every day base. I am tired of putting heavy makeup on like I said. This gives me a very nice healthy glow with minimal coverage so I do add concealer and do the rest of my makeup like I normally would and the final result is really lovely. I look healthy and I'm.not embarrassed of people looking at my face so up close as much. It wears of nicely, too. I think peope who like a natural look would love it specially if you have normal to dry skin. It didn't hold up as long on my combination skin but I didn't expect it to. I thought  I had picked a darker shade but I still went with it because I prefer a bit darker than lighter and to my surprise it matched very well to my skintone! It sort of adjusts to it because it doesn't have a strong pigment. You can use the 'Try it\" option so you'll know how to find your shade for a good match.",

        "comments": "I have no idea how this product receives such rave reviews. It's a moisturizer, and provides zero coverage. It's not makeup. I visited an Ulta store, where I told them what my goals are (light-medium coverage, natural look, friendly to my aging millennial skin, buildable coverage when necessary, etc). Kudos to the associate - They did color match me exactly. However, after using this product myself at home, it literally does nothing. I even purchased the Hourglass setting powder to finish off the look, to no avail. And not only that! I used my usual makeup routine over top (eyelid primer, eyeshadow, eyeliner), and this Skin Tint is so \"moisturizing\" that even with my tried-and-true eyelid primer, my eyeshadow and eyeliner were all but gone by the end of the work day. I also had to use A LOT of this product to achieve even just the slightest bit of coverage. When I use my tried-and-true BB cream, I use mayyyybe a few little dabs to get the coverage I'm looking for. Needless to say, this will be going back to the store. No idea how this product made it through the testing phase and onto store shelves. It needs to be rebranded as a moisturizer, because it's definitely not makeup.",
