I've ordered their facial wash, facial scrub, and eye cream -- I have a very sensitive skin, so that could also play a role. However, Kylieskin needs to improve their overall customer service dept. It had been a hassle trying to get a refund on the items when I was also willing to reship them since I was having a reaction on their products. First representative informed me that I need to reach out again within 10 days since my package was delivered per their 10-day policy. Second representative took four times of emailing me back and forth trying to get my order number, items ordered, items to complain, photos of lot numbers on each product, and photos of the reaction when I have included this on my initial email to her. Conclusively, after four days of reaching out (10 days after I initially emailed them), she ended up refunding me the items, but deducted the shipping cost ~$10. Think twice before you hit the \"checkout\" button please.\n                    In addition, it took forever until I was able to receive the package. It was supposedly delivered on June 15, but didn't receive it until June 21st. I had bought the item on June 10. They had charged me a $10 shipping for receiving the item 11 days from when I initially bought it and didn't even had the courtesy to refund me that shipping cost.",
