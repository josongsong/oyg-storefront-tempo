This remover has been working for me through my goth phase, many years of theater performances, pageants, and everyday life. I wet a cotton pad, hold it to my eye for a few seconds, and gently swipe. Removes the majority. Flip the pad and repeat, should get the rest. The feeling is cooling, never burning, never greasy, no residue. I'm so surprised at all the mixed reviews because I just love this stuff. And the value is incredible!",

I was surprised at how instantly painful this product was to my eye and the area surrounding my eyes. Even after washing it off with cool water it still burned and continues to burn an hour later. I am not allergic to any of the ingredients and do not have sensitive eyes. On top of that I still feel like I have some mascara remaining and my eyelashes feel dry and coarse.",
