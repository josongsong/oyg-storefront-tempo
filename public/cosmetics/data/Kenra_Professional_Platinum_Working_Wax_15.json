        "comments": "I have been using the texturizing taffy for awhile and really do like it...just wanted to compare the working wax to it. I love both but the wax wins out for me just slightly ahead of the taffy. I have chin length straight, fine hair but not thin. It loses volume and hold after styling and ends can get quite dry and frizzy but this helps handle all of that. I don't need a lot, just a pea size amount, rub between hands and run my fingers through and it's been great.",

I even fell asleep with the product in my hair and woke up with almost no frizz, it also did not leave behind any \"residue\" or white flakes and it didn't look greasy.

A slight scent that I detected was like a clean linen scent. The texture was thick making it easy to take out just the amount I needed and work it into my damp hair and then take out a little bit more as I went along, blow drying and styling it. I have some shorter flyaway hairs near my scalp, that I've used cuticle polisher, mousses and other hair care products on to control. I liked this working wax better because the stiffer product texture was easier to work with than more liquid type applications and my hair did not feel sticky nor tacky during the styling nor afterwards. Unfortunately it did not completely control the flyaways, which is why I did not give it five stars, but it did a pretty good job and earned four stars.",

I wanted something that smooths over hair and provides shine and taming of flyaways.  Not the product. Can't believe Ulta recommended this as a substitute.  Total waste of my money.",
