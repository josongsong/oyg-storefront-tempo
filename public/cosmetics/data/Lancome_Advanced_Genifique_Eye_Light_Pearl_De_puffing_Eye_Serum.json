I know it was the product because I tried to use it a couple months after my stye cleared. I ended up with a stye again. I just think that even when using the applicator on clean hands, then applying it to under eyes; still makes it unsanitary. Plus the price makes this product not worth it.",

It isn't an instant fix, but it does work over a couple of weeks. It works more quickly at reducing puffiness - usually in an hour or so. I'm going to be 40 this year so I was interested in preventing any crowsfeet that may be creeping up on me as well. Since I didn't have any to start with and I don't have any now, I couldn't say if the product helped there. I do have the worry lines between my eyebrows and though I can still see them, during my most stressful times at work, the lines don't appear to be aggrivated (like I get!#. The product doesn't have any particular smell #I like scented products) and it is very light. It is not oily at all. It takes a bit to soak in so its not like an under eye cream where you just rub it in and then put on your moisturizer and makeup. You need to give it 2-3 minutes to absorb so I'd make it the first part of your routine after you wash your face. I'm online here to buy a second bottle. This has become an essential part of my skin care routine.",

There is nothing good I can say about it. The best eye cream I have used was Lancome's Absolue Precious Cells. That is the only one that significantly improved the whole eye area in every way. It is too expensive for me to use on a regular basis. If I am lucky to get it in a gift, I will use it exclusively. For now I use the Absolue eye cream which is in gift when I make a purchase often enough to last me.",
