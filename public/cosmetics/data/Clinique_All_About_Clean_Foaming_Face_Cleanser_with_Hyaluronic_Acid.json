        "comments": "Just received this in my order, and I looked at the ingredients on the back because the bottle i received looks a teeny bit different than the one shown here; the ingredients lists are WILDLY DIFFERENT!  I came to this product's Q&A sections wondering if anyone asked about this already; i found what i was looking for and can confirm that what is listed here is not accurate, in fact the product i recieved isn't even available for sale anywhere on Ulta's website/app (i will include pictures if possible).  I really wanted what is listed for sale here: a foaming cleanser that does not contain myristic acid, palmitic acid, lauric acid, or stearic acid… as these ingredients are known pore-cloggers (at least in my experience they are).  The listed product (and its ingredients list) are non-comedogenic, and the product i got will would break me out like crazy!  I'm going to go to a local Ulta store and pray that i can a) find the correct product, and b) exchange this version i received for what i actually paid for!",

I wear mineral sunscreen daily and it removed it with ease. I didnt need a seperate cleanser to remove makeup, it easily got rid of my long wearing foundation. I didnt use it to remove my eye makeup. I stick to micellar water for that. My face feels squeeky clean afterwards, but not overly dry. I just wished this version came in more sizes like the pink version. I should mention that i have sensitive skin that usually dislikes new products but i had no problem with this one. So its my new cleanser and im very happy.",

I usually use type 2 soap but type 1 clarifiying lotion and 1-2 lotion in my 3-step regimen. I have only been able to use this sonic soap once a day, as it absolutely strips my skin, and I have done nothing but break out (in both blemishes and dry patches) since I started using it. Some of the foam got up into my nose one time and it burned like crazy, but that was nothing compared to when some ran into my eye in the shower. I am so grateful that I started using the sonic cleansing brush well before I tried this soap, or I might not have given the brush a chance. The brush is fabuous, and when used with my regular Clinique liquid cleansing soap, it's amazing. But with this soap, my skin feels tight, breaks out in blemishes and dry patches, and never looks hydrated or bright. Such a huge disappointment! :(",
