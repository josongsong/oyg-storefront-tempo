I have used them in the mornings after a rough night and it helped with puffiness. I've used them at night as part of self care and go to bed feeling fresh. No discernable scent and it's in a resealable package. I took them on a plane without issue. I just bought 3 more packages for cyber Monday. Highly recommend.",

        "comments": "Used these eye patches after my shower one night, noticed the next morning that the texture of my under eye skin was much smoother, however that night started experiencing some reactions. Began with tenderness under my eyes, then the next morning woke up to my under eyes being swollen, having irritation with some clusters of small raised bumps in several areas and splotchy redness surrounding both eyes. Didn't itch but was tender to touch.",
