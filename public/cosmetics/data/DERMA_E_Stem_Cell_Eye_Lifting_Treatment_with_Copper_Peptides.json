Not high expectations, esp since I've tried virtually every UHE eye cream. This checks all the boxes. Moisture without heavy oil. Absorption.  Fine lines and wrinkles almost gone. Mildly lighter circles. Plays well with UHE and DS concealers. Does not fight with primer or shadow. Let it fully dry, liner and mascara stay true. It's not quite as effective periorally. Best stuff in 30 years!",

I have loved almost every Derma-e product I've ever tried, so I thought I would give this a shot to try to help with hydration and to do a little something to minimize the appearance of the undereye sagging. Sadly, this eye cream didn't do either. The texture is great and it never irritated my eyes or skin, but it just did...nothing. I used it at night and in the morning as the instructions say, and I didn't notice any difference in either the bags or fine lines around/under my eyes, nor did I notice any improvement in hydration. I get more benefit from my regular day and night moisturizers. I'm really disappointed that this product, at least for me, was a huge flop.",

I have used other skincare from Derma e as well. But when I went to other eye creams, my skin started to droop towards my eyelashes again. I recently read all the good ingredients that will help eyelids become firm and lifting again and the ingredients in this eye cream are on the list. So I went back to this one and lo and behold, I can see my eyelids again! Even though pricey, it is worth every penny.  It does work for me and please Derma e, do NOT discontinue this! NOTE: The package logo has recently changed but the ingredients are still the same.",
