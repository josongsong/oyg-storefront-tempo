The small quad palette fits in my hand, so it is small. I don't mind that, it will be great for travel. I was disappointed when I swatched the shades, they felt dry. I was expecting a buttery feel to them. The shadow shades are not anything new. We have seen these colors many times. Don't get me wrong, I like this color story. I was just expecting the formula to be so much more! Especially considering the price and the brand! The shades in here are all metallic. Honestly the formula meh nothing special and the shades are not like wow they stand out! Overall, Yes the shadows still work, but again I was expecting so much more considering both the brand and price!",

The packaging is sleek, elegant, and feels high-end exactly what you'd expect from Hourglass. But it's the formula and color payoff that truly steal the show. Idealist is the most stunning warm-toned neutral with just the right touch of sophistication. It's incredibly versatile , perfect for a soft daytime look or built up for something more dramatic. The texture is buttery smooth, blends effortlessly, and wears like a dream with zero creasing or fallout. What I love most is the clean, vegan formula that doesn't compromise on performance. It's pigmented, long-lasting, and flattering on every skin tone. I've received so many compliments every time I wear it! Whether you're curating your perfect palette or looking for a standout single shade, Idealist is a must-have. Worth every penny . I'm obsessed! \"Complimentary from hourglasscosmetics\"",

        "comments": "Gifted by Hourglass to give my honest thoughts and opinions! Wow, I love the metal casing of this palette. The color of the metal is nice and it just simply says Hourglass on it. The small quad palette fits in my hand, so it is small. I don't mind that, it will be great for travel. I was disappointed when I swatched the shades, they felt dry. I was expecting a buttery feel to them. The shadow shades are not anything new. We have seen these colors many times. Don't get me wrong, I like this color story. I was just expecting the formula to be so much more! Especially considering the price and the brand! The shades in here are all metallic. Honestly the formula meh nothing special and the shades are not like wow they stand out! Overall, Yes the shadows still work, but again I was expecting so much more considering both the brand and price!",
