I do think the color is beautiful but having to go over a few times was annoying, but could also be because it was new and needed to warm up??? The color doesn't pull up a lot but in the sun it is BEAUTIFUL, just wish the color payoff was a bit better. All in all a decent product and felt like it stayed well throughout the day.",

It's nothing to regret over, but I'm gonna look for something else once I run out. If you already have this, soak a cotton round in remover then place over you eye for ten seconds, wiggle in place, then swipe to clean. It's the best way to get most of the liner from your eye, in my experience.",
