        "comments": "I started with the mini beauty prep set last week and LOVE these products. My regular routine was CeraVe cleanser and lotion (with a drop of clinique acne solutions -all over clearing treament on top) then my Jane Iredale makeup, which never cause breakouts, but as I've recently turned 40 they seem to dry my skin out too much. In general, I prefer to use healthier ingredients and cruelty-free product lines, but had never found products that keep my skin as clear as the CeraVe. So when Jane Iredale's BeautyPrep three step came out I was excited, but hesitant to invest since the CeraVe is pretty inexpensive. So... while I was preparing myself to invest in the BeautyPrep, I looked online for comparable healthy/green products. I found TataHarper products and was enchanted by their marketing and promises. I purchased their trial set and unfortunately after two weeks my skin was a total wreck, I was breaking out everywhere and inflamed all over. It was a painful setback. I was grateful to be able to return their products and went back to my old CeraVe routine. My skin was recovering slowly and I was still unhappy with the drying/dulling result.... So last week I finally purchased the Jane Iredale BeautyPrep minis began using them. I am still using the CeraVe if I feel like I need extra cleansing from on a heavier than usual makeup day or a day when I have car line duty at school. I still put on the drop of clinique after the BeautyPrep lotion, but I think I may be able to wean myself off of that soon too.... The result? my skin is looking so amazingly clear and looks/feels dewy fresh!! I am even seeing improvement in the skin on my neck and chest which has had a few areas of light rosacea-like patches. I am thrilled and I mean really really thrilled with these three products. These products are just perfect. I pray that they be available for the rest my life!!",

        "comments": "I received this toner complimentary for testing purposes in my Jane Iredale VoxBox. I'm just so so about this product. I did read that a lot of people were unhappy with the smell but personally, I didn't mind. I'm not overly sensitive to smell in my products so maybe that's it. What has me on the fence is that I don't really think it did anything for me. I have non-sensitive combo skin and it didn't break me out or leave my skin feeling tight but I also didn't see anything I'd consider a difference. Soooo...yea, I just feel so so about this product.",
