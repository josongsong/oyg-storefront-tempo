My previous moisturizer did not provide enough hydration for my over 60 skin & it felt dry by morning.  The Bobbi Brown Hydrating Face Cream makes my skin still feel hydrated in the morning & it blurs my pores!!!  Works well under foundation also... give it about 10 minutes before I apply my foundation & I'm good to go.  Does not take a lot of product either.  I've been using for about a week to make sure I didn't have any reactions & I didn't.  Will definitely repurchase!!",

My dermatologist gave me several samples of products to try over the course of several months, but all of them kept my face very dry. After tons of research and hundreds of dollars wasted, I found this (and many other Bobbi Brown make-up products). I went to my local dealer and a consultant gave me a makeover and recommended $500 worth of products. As she applied the moisturizer, I knew by the way it felt on my skin that I was buying it. I ended up buying everything she recommended that day. Within a week, my skin was entirely clear and looked even better than it did before I developed the condition. And my makeup looked amazing! She taught me a few tricks that I was unaware of ( mainly because I've never really learned much about makeup.) I've received multiple comments on my skin and makeup since I started using Bobbi Brown cosmetics and skin care. I'm a true believer!",
