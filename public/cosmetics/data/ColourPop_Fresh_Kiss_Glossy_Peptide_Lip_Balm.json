It goes on nicely. I definitely want to try other flavors and would recommend this 100% only thing I was disappointed is that I was hoping it was a little bit more pink but other than that not really that disappointed. I actually highly recommend these. I'll be definitely trying other flavors in the future. Price point is pretty good too. it's comparable to way more expensive brands and out shines the expensive ones.",

I have been a fan of the Summer Fridays lip butter balm for a while now, but am always on the hunt for more affordable options. Well, I found them! Both of them are sheer tints which I love, I like being able to still see the color of my own lips through them. The shade of Caramel Latte is a perfect nude brown and mixes with the pink of my lips perfectly! It also smells literally just like a caramel latte. The Cherry Glaze shade is an amazing juicy, sheer red and will be perfect for summer! The scent reminds me of a cherry-flavored Tootsie Pop! Neither of them taste like anything which I honestly like. I would prefer my lip products to smell good and not have a flavor. Both are amazing and I would definitely recommend!",

        "comments": "I didnt buy these from ulta but I just wanted to say, these are grainy. I don't know if colourpop sent me a bad batch but thry are all grainy and the grains taste like salt or something. I also think the majority of the smells are just bad. Strawberry, mango, and watermelon smelt like plastic and fake fruit like a scratch and sniff. Choco one was good! Still grainy. And I 1) don't live somewhere cold and 2) am not putting in extra work for a lip balm. I think naturium is the better value for your money with this one.",
