        "comments": "I was having trouble deciding between this and the Salicylic Acid cleanser... since it's winter and my skin tends to be on the dry side, plus using \"harsh\" actives in my routine, I went with this one. IMMEDIATELY after 1st use, my skin was glowing. It's been a few weeks now and everytime I use it, I love it even more. I use it alone AM and double Cleanse PM (Oat Cleansing Balm as step 1) and it just feels soooo good on your skin. It foams up nicely which concerned me at first because my skin barrier was a bit compromised when I began using this but 0 irritation. It's like a gentle, silky foam if that makes sense. Your skin feels like velvet afterwards too. Most importantly, this is literally the ONLY \"gel\" or \"foamy\" cleanser I've ever used in my entire life that doesn't make your skin feel dry or tight after rinsing. Seriously, I could lather it up on my face for a good 5 to 10 mins and not worry about feeling dried out afterwards. Zero irritation and even better, zero purging or breakouts. Can't speak much on if it's helping any hyperpigmentation yet but even if it doesn't, it's definitely staying in my routine.",

It's red it's so sore, it's tight it hurts and iv been in pain not to mention the added flakes of skin all on my face. I can't use anything not even my usual fragrance free moisturiser on my face as I am in pain and it's burning. It's been 2 days since iv stopped using it and I am slightly less red but my skin is sore. I am dreading how long it will take to repair. I can't use anything on my skin even water burns 😢",
