I'm forever seeking a non-drying but effectively cleaning face cleanser. This was drying after one use and from experience I know it will cumulatively dry me out over time, so I'm stopping with the one try. Based on that, I'm assuming the Juju will be too harsh for me. If your skin isn't very dry, but more towards the normal side of dry, this might be good for you. No scent, effective cleansing, soft sort of creamy lather. Little case is cute and I'm sure would be handy if I weren't returning.",

They are small but last way longer than I expected them to. The full size versions of these bars take forever to go through even when used 2x a day. They also don't leave skin with the typical bar soap feel of being tacky/ dry.",

They're gentle enough to use when they aren't my regular facial cleanser. I use them at night, let them dry in the opened case, and they're ready to pack up in the morning. I've been using these for years.  I can't believe these don't get more attention.",

        "comments": "I've always dealt with skin sensitivity but for some unknown reason, at 35 years old, I woke up one morning and my skin had decided to reject everything I'd ever used. The Hyaluronic acid serum I'd used for months suddenly caused chemical burns, my skin was peeling, breaking out, and looked horrific—and no one could tell me why. (Still can't, actually) I wound up ordering Drunk Elephant's Baby Bar Travel Duo as a shot in the dark. Not only did my skin handle these bars, it LOVED them. My skin started to clear up within a couple of days after using these DE bars. I love how neither of these strip my skin of its natural oils—they're also fragrance free, for those of you who also battle sensitivity, and last a long time! I bought my duo in May, use one of the two bars every single day, twice a day, and they still haven't run out! I ordered the full sized bars to replace them a few weeks ago but they're still going strong! They might be small, but they're powerful. One full sized bar will fit inside of the travel case so that's reusable too :) Drunk Elephant has helped keep my sensitivity at bay while working to effectively target all of my skin concerns, so while they are definitely pricier than other brands, I find them to be worth it. I certainly have no intentions of switching!",

        "comments": "In the midst of me having an ongoing allergic reaction to another brand I went back to my basics which is Drunk Elephant. I decided to give these bars a try to see if it would help my face recover from the allergic reaction I was having. I cannot rave enough about these bars! They are so great for sensitive skin or skin that has been damaged. These give you a nice clean feeling without too much exfoliation and stripping of the skin. I will forever add these to my collection. My only complaint would be the size… I mean they are travel size but still rather small. That's okay though! The product itself definitely gets 5 stars.",
