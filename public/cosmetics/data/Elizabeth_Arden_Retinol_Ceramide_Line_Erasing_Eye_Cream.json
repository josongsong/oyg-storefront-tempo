If it's sold in store high end or drug store I have tried it all to see what works best for me. My skin care routine is not cheap but every product has been worth every penny. I look way younger then my age thanks to amazing skin care products.I am so happy I found this retinal eye cream from Elizabeth Arden. I have combination oily skin and very sensitive skin so I have to be very careful also what I put on my skin. This I cream I've been using for a couple weeks now and it truly is amazing I've been using it every night in the first night I could see results already. I started having some peeling at first but that's what showed me how the eye Cream was working getting the old layers of skin off. I could literally see the layers come off in my eyes felt smooth hydrated and amazing. I also noticed during the day when I applied my eye make up that it lasted way longer than normal in my eyelids look super smooth. For the price to me the price is amazing it's pretty cheap in my opinion for a good skin care product. With as well as it works I would expect it to cost way money.After a week there was no more appealing at all but I could see how well it was working at hydrating of my eye area and I truly could see little lines disappearing and it lightning up lines that were deeper than I thought there would be no chance of them ever going away unless they had cosmetic surgery. I also like that this ice cream doesn't have strong smells to it or it doesn't smell like perfume it actually is creamy and smooth and it works amazing. I have a skin care fridge and I would not recommend putting this in the fridge it says to keep it in a cool dry area and I'd be worried it would mess with the ingredients. Also you're only supposed to use this retinol at night so make sure in the mornings you wash it off so that it doesn't cause reactions when you go outside and you're exposed to the sun. I highly recommend using this product I'm so happy I found it. Thankfully I've received Elizabeth Arden products before in my make up subscription boxes so I have tried different stuff from Elizabeth Arden but this item I found and I truly am in love with it it's something I will be using in my every day skin routine for now on. Before you try any major surgeries or spend thousands of dollars on anything Else give this a try you will not be disappointed I know I am not I am so happy.",

And this is my second time I'm trying to leave a review just to warn people but they won't post my review. I don't recommend this brand as they are not honest with people",
