I've used so many different eye creams- high end/luxury and affordable- and have never noticed a difference in my 31 year old eyes (fine lines). this stuff is magic! my eyes look so youthful and plump. I absolutely love it. the first couple times I tried it, I had to start slow because I did feel a slight burning. but now I've been using this a few months and have no sensitivity to it. will be re-purchasing!",

On the flip side, I wouldn't be upset if it was sold out and I had to purchase a different eye cream. I am still open to options but this is doing the job. It goes on nicely and does not cause me any problems. I can't tell if the product is working and doing all the things it claims to, but I'm not about to use it on only one eye to compare results, so --- I am happy with it and only gave it 4 stars because it doesn't make me insanely excited or like I feel it's the best eye cream ever. It's just good :)",

I have been using this new formula for a few weeks now and do not like it. I feel like it actually causes under-eye puffiness, almost like a reaction to this new formula under my right eye specifically. I stopped using it for a couple of days and the puffiness went away. Tried it again and it came back.\nAs a side note- though I really liked the old formula, I did go snow skiing for a full day this past winter on a beautiful sunny day. Lots of rays! The next several days I had quite puffy under-eye areas to both sides. I had not used any other products, no sunscreen (yes, I forgot to apply and forgot my sunglasses!) and felt that I had a reaction to this product.\nUnfortunately, I will not be repurchasing this product.",
