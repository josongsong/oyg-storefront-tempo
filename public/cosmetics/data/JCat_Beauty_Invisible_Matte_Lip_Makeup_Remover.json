        "comments": "This clear gloss-like lip product is awesome. I love longwear lipstick but I hate how my lips feel when I try to remove it. I decided to try this because it was so cheap and I am impressed. You swipe it on like any lip product, wait a few seconds, then wipe all traces of lipstick away. It's  easy to use and completely portable. Definitely worth a try!",

I wear a lot of matte lipsticks and this is a very effective tool to remove it. My only complaint would be if \nyou squeeze the tube too hard a lot of product will come out and end up being wasted, so squeeze lightly. I would definitely purchase this again.",

I tested it with a Jeffree Star velour liquid lip (No Tea No Shade) & it's crazy how well this works. There's no scent, & no aftertaste in case you get some in your mouth lol. So glad I bought it before it became out of stock!!",
