This one has been the most hydrating so far.  Also soaks into the skin perfectly.  Also it takes VERY LITTLE to fully moisturizer your face.  \n\nI'm hoping it pairs well with the cleanser!",

This product was unfortunately a let down for me, entirely. It has the same consistency just a little heavier than the mucin, but it doesn't translate the same on the skin. It dries out super fast and dried my skin out to the same point as if you'd just started using retinol, it was that bad. Mind you I have combination skin and have never had a problem with getting too dry just sometimes too oily so I was completely shocked when this dried out my skin completely. It also sadly irritated my skin as well. I actually came to the reviews to see if anyone else had the same experience.",

It's one of the few snail-based products that does not break me out or give me fungal acne, but makes my skin clear, glossy and moisturized. It's hard for me to find skincare products that don't pill under SPF, but this is one of the best. Great for daytime any nighttime, but if you're using at night, I would recommend adding an oil ot an occlusive like vaseline to lock the moisture in, because it does dry quickly.",

On days when I'm in a rush, the Snail Mucin line is my go-to and is effective on its own, but combined with a few Ordinary products, it's the most amazing skin care regimen I have ever used. This moisturizing cream does have a very unique texture when you first apply it, but it is far and away the best!! It tightens, firms, moisturizes, and protects! I LOVE IT!!!",

However, this product really triggered the hyperpigmentation and dryness around my chin area. It was almost a purple-brown color that I hadn't gotten since before I became invested in skincare a couple years ago. My skin also became very flaky and would get dry after about an hour of applying this cream which surprised me and I would apply more in hopes that it'd help but my skin would just get even more dry. I wasn't using any other products other than my rose water facial mist and the birch sap moisturizing lotion :(( my skin just didn't like this product at all but i gave the cream to a friend and she fell in love with it lol.",

Works great as an AM moisturizer and PM moisturizer, and can be layered with an occlusive on top for even more hydration. Did not irritate my very acne-prone skin, and absorbs quickly enough to be used under makeup and sunscreen.",

Unfortunately, even with really strong, great brands, not everything works for every skin type. I'd wanted to try this as a new moisturizer, as what I'd been using made my skin a bit too oily, and I'd tried a snail based face mask a while back that made my skin super soft. I'd assumed that this cream would do the same. For starters, it seems REALLY goopy right out of the jar - but it's not sticky, and it felt like even if I put on too much, it quickly absorbed into my skin without leaving a film or a cast behind. Great, right? Except I noticed that during the day...my nose, my cheeks - they felt SUPER dry. Like I'd washed my face with steaming hot water dry. And whenever I put my sunscreen over it, it felt like it made the dryness worse. Over a few days of using this product, I noticed that I was breaking out in the same areas where I was feeling that excessive dryness - cheeks, chin, nose. So it looks like I'm going to be returning this!",
