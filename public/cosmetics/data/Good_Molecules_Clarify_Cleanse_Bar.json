Immediately it calmed my redness, by the end if the day my break outs were smaller and less painful. I struggle with adult \"acne\" (mainly little painful pimples) and i break out on my monthly. This is a life saver! I have used tons of products and this is by far my favorite. I have found its brightened my skin, cleared dead skin, i even found its softened fine lines which isnt even listed in the description but its amazing and doesnt burn my eyes either! A+. Also, ive been using this for about 2 months now and all i can say is the results just get better and better!",

        "comments": "Can someone explain to me why this 5 dollar bar soap completely changed my skin in a week?? I bought this on a whim with other products, I have been using it on my body only for a week as I have lots of very stubborn body acne for like... 8 years that I am trying everything to get rid of, I thought an acne fighting soap bar couldn't hurt in conjunction with the other stuff I'm doing. Ummm. It's the best my back and chest has ever looked. And I thought... huh... is this puny little SOAP BAR really making a difference? So I tried it on my face today. Y'all WHAT?! I am glowing!!! I look like a literal angel. Is this forreal??? Basically the only thing I am using on my back now is this bar, the good molecules niacinamide TONER (also incredible) every other day bc every day was too much for my skin, and a really good moisturizer from another brand w squalene and rose hip oils in it. And then sometimes some head and shoulders shampoo for the zinc pyrthione, like 1-2 times a week, and a glycolic exfoliator once a week.  Anyways, thoroughly confused. Now officially obsessed with Good Molecules.  Please try this if you have body or face acne. It's 5 bucks. I have acne prone, very sensitive, combination oily and dry skin, for the record. Including rosacea. So... all the things.",

        "comments": "I had high hopes for this cleansing bar. Despite it being a bar as opposed to in a bottle of some sort, it seemed to be exactly what I was looking for (I just find bars to be messy). I've been using it for about 3 weeks now and my skin has only gotten worse. Now, I try to be patient and understand that it can take time for skin to get used to new products. But I thought I'd start seeing an improvement by now. Then, tonight when I used this to wash my face, I used a completely white wash cloth to dry my face off and the dirt that was left behind on the towel left me speechless! I don't wear much makeup. A tinted moisturizer and then a couple small dabs of concealer on the more obvious spots. And I use a makeup remover before I wash. And yet, after washing my face with this \"cleansing\" bar, there was still dirt left behind. I then used a cleansing toner on a cotton round to see if anything more would come off and, sure enough, more dirt. So now the mystery of why my skin was getting worse is solved. It wasn't actually getting clean. Somehow this works for some people, because majority of the reviews are good. But it's obviously not for me.",
