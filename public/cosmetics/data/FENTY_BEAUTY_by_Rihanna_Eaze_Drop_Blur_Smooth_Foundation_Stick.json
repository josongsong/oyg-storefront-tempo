This left me very oily, i would have to put on a lot of setting powder throughout the day which was the whole point that i didnt want to have to do that. It also was a bit patchy under my eyes and by my nose and cheeks but that could have been something with my skin. If youre looking for something more less-coverage and not glowy, this isnt for you",

It blends perfectly and doesn't crease. I'm on the older side and some makeup seems to fill my wrinkles and highlight them and this does not do that. It really is one of the best foundation choices I've used so far, and you can build on it if you want more coverage. I even use it to even out my skin when I don't want to wear any other makeup. It is my newest favorite as are most of the Fenty products.",

        "comments": "I recently had the opportunity to try out the Fenty Beauty Eaze Drop Stick Blur + Smooth Tint Foundation, courtesy of a free sample from Fenty Beauty as a Buzz feed agent in exchange for an honest review. From the moment I received the product, I was impressed by its packaging – a sleek and beautifully designed stick that elegantly resembles a lipstick.\n\nOne of the standout features of this foundation is its remarkable durability. I put it to the test during an intense workout session, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the product stayed intact, without smudging or streaking. This is a game-changer for those of us who are constantly on the move and need a foundation that can keep up with our active lifestyles.\n\nThe foundation lives up to its name by effortlessly blending onto the skin. Upon application, it seamlessly blurs imperfections and provides a smooth and even tint that enhances my natural complexion. This aspect of the product truly shines, allowing for a natural and radiant finish that doesn't feel heavy or cakey.\n\nAs a fan of Rihanna's commitment to inclusivity, I was pleased to discover that the Fenty Beauty Eaze Drop Stick Foundation offers a range of shades that cater to a diverse array of skin tones. This inclusivity adds to the product's appeal, ensuring that everyone can find their perfect match.\nIn conclusion, the Fenty Beauty Eaze Drop Stick Blur + Smooth Tint Foundation has left a positive impression on me. Not only is the packaging visually appealing, but the product's performance also speaks for itself. Its ability to stay put during a workout and its seamless blending properties make it a standout choice in the world of foundations. If you're in search of a reliable and versatile foundation, this one is definitely worth considering.",

        "comments": "If you're young with better pores, this would great. My skin is still pretty great for 31 as I take serious care of it, however due to the nature of this product. It doesn't look amazing in my skin but I've seen worse too. It's actually pretty thin when it spreads on and I can't imagine how it could actually blur for anyone, even young with small pores. There might be reviews saying it does blue but I really believe they are the exception not the average. However, I do enjoy this a bit under my eyes. When I go to work I don't have a full face, just spf mixed with the dermablend pigment drops (I don't advise mixing spf with anything because that changes the chemical composition and dilutes the spf, but these specific drops actually emhanse protection so say studies and dermatologist I trust)then a but if xrewm/liquid blush on my fave and eyes, lips sometimes. If I've had a particularly long night I use this product a bug under my eyes (the lightest shade us actually more fair than the name of light, moreso than you would think for the small shade range which is another issue. Anyway, a bit tapped around where concealer goes (the corner and our side corner, the trend now I guess) looks super brightening without looking crazy. As of now, I wouldn't purchase it again but I'm glad I have it. If I finish the product and find im sad it's fine, obviously I would purchase another and change my reviews, ha, but I don't think it's that amazing.",
