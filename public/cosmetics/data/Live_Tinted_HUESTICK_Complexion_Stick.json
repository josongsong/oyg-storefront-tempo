        "comments": "The first few times I used this, I HATED it. I thought it was the worst product I had ever tried until I learned how to use it. First, this pills horribly under certain SPF's. I can't use this with Supergoop, only my La Roche-Posay mineral SPF works well under this. Second, if you apply too much this looks heavy, cakey, and insane. I have learned the hard way I only need 3-4 swipes to get good medium coverage. Less is more. I blend this out using a brush, and that's what works for me. If there are any areas that aren't blending well or that I need additional product, I use a finger and tap to blend or the product will start moving and smearing. Once I figured all these things out, I really do like this product. I'm 36, normal to dry skin, and this wears for almost the entire day before settling into my fine lines. The finish looks beautiful, very natural and skin-like. It's lightweight and feels like I'm not wearing anything. I like that it's a stick, easy to travel with, and the packaging is really heavy and great quality (cool magnetic cap too). Overall, this gets 4/5 because it shouldn't take so much trial and error to figure out how to use something. I prefer Ilia's stick foundation over this, but can't find my color match in that line. Also, if you have dry skin I don't think you would like this, I would stick with their skin tint.",

        "comments": "I love how lightweight it is! You don't need much to make it happen, but it's buildable if you need more coverage. I have a fair complexion with rosacea, so it's hard finding something that will matches my undertone without it being too thick. It leaves a more dewy look, so if you're looking for something more matte, I'd say you'd have to find a happy medium with your primer to balance it out. It's very moisturizing! It didn't leave my face feeling dry when I washed it off. I have big pores as well, and I felt that it didn't sit into them so much since I paired it with the La Roche Posay Matte Moisturizer and Good Molecules sunscreen. I might try a more pore minimizing primer to see if that will make any difference in the future.",
