It never broke me out, helped balance pH level, didn't irritate if it got in your eyes. I LOVED it but unfortunately I will never be buying this again. Also the ingredient Titanium dioxide?!!! It's a shame that Mad Hippie is doing what most other companies do just to fill their pockets more.",

My face was feeling very irritated, oily yet dry, and I had a bunch of texture all over. I was at the end of my rope with all the skincare lines that I own. Until I remembered I bought this a while back. I started using this for my only cleansing step and my skin is loving it!\n\nI don't follow the recommended way to use this cleanser. I apply on dry skin, work it in for a bit, and then I add a little water to emulsify. I remove with a warm, damp reusable cotton round (I love the Garnier reusable face pads). It gets everything off, and my face feels clean and moisturized at the same time. The only con is I wish it came in a bigger bottle.",

Admittedly that last one is a me thing not a products fault. I've tried so many over the years and just never enjoyed the experience but I enjoy healthy skin so ya gotta do what ya gotta do. Then I found this cleanser.\nI'm fully aware I sound nutty but I actually look forward to using this cleanser. It feels so good on my skin! It doesn't sting my eyes and never leaves my dry skin feeling stripped. It doesn't foam so it's easy to rinse by wiping off a few times with a wet muslin cloth. When I wear makeup I use a cleansing balm first then this but it's effective enough to remove everything leftover and on no makeup days it removes my spf like a champ. My toner cotton pad always comes away clean when I've used this.\nAs long as Mad Hippie makes this, I'll keep buying! Speaking of MH, I'm slowly integrating more of their products into my routine and I'm loving this brand!",

        "comments": "I've bought this from Ulta twice, and both times it went rancid before the bottle was finished. With the second bottle, I know I bought it online from Ulta in November 2020, and it had been manufactured in September 2019. (The manufacturing information was given by the Transparency App QR code on the packaging.) I'm not quite done with the bottle yet, but it's rancid, like rancid oil.\n\nThis isn't a fault with the product, per se. Oils go rancid, some sooner than others. Products have shelf-lives. Some environments are better for keeping oils fresh than others. But it would be good to have expected expiration dates, and an easier way to be sure that you're buying a fresher product.\n\nAll I can suggest is to buy it in person, so you can check the manufacture dates yourself on the package before you buy, and maybe don't store it in your bathroom. (It's not like my bathroom is poorly vented or usually steamy, and I've never had this problem before with other toiletries--even oil based products--but maybe keeping it in the coolest area of your house is a good idea.)",
