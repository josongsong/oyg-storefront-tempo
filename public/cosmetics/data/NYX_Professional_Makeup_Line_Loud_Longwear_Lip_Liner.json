It's okay with the shine loud lipstick (That are literally a god send, i bought about 30 of them now, not just to try different colors restocks) . I would just use those as a lipliner majority of the time. But alas I was out of my beloved lipstick shade total baller. So i got the lipliner. With the gloss it gets almost gummy. I never have that problem with just the lipstick. With the liner it literally pills if i do anything (eat drink purse my lips together). Matte no lipgloss it last fine but its matte so obviously its not very comfy. I havent tested it with a regular lipstick but i can imagine it last similarly to the gloss.",

        "comments": "Definitely would recommend this product to my friends. I have this lip liner in 6 different colors and would totally buy more. My friend showed me this liner in the shade rebel kind and I have not turned back to my previous lip liner. The color stays on for a long time, so you don't have to reapply every hour. Also the formula is very creamy.\n\nDownside is that these liners are SHARPENABLE. They do NOT have a swivel, so they aren't retractable. I recommend getting the NYX sharpener. I only sharpened them once so far and it wasnt bad. If you do have issues sharpening try putting the liner in the fridge for a few minutes and it should harden.\n\nAlso beware of buying this online because different skin tones affect what the color will actually come out as. Thats why some colors look different on then what the picture shows. I had two colors look a little bit lighter then what I thought I was getting, but they still look good.",

This pencil goes on gray… if it goes on at all, that is. It loves to go on patchy, clumpy, and inconsistent. I always start my lip looks with a Mac lip primer (it's always worked for me!) but it seems like this lip liner was fighting with my primer every step of the way. I'm usually pretty forgiving when i try new products but after my first failed attempt to use this, i pitched it. :(",
