        "comments": "I really like these brow pencils. Honestly, I didn't have high hopes because at the time I ordered, there was only one review and it wasn't a very positive one. But! In my opinion, these are very good if you can find your shade. I'll say right away that if you are light blonde, you are much better off with the \"Studio\" brow kit in \"Ash\" because even the \"Taupe\" pencil will be too dark for you.\nThese are suitable for medium blonde to dark.\nSo I got \"Taupe\" and \"Neutral Brown\" because I'm medium blonde at the moment ;). Can't be happier that I decided to give these a try!\nThe texture of these is very similar to other brands' brow pencils; they aren't too waxy, but not too soft either. They are soft enough to allow the pencil to glide when you apply it, but not too soft, so they don't feel like a sticky gel or anything like that. The pigmentation is very good; you definitely don't need to go over the same spot over and over again, which sometimes happens when the pencil is too waxy or just has poor pigmentation. I included the pictures, so that you can see the difference between the two colors and the amount of product you are getting. Speaking of the amount of products, you don't get much, as you can see, but you can't beat the price. If I had known I was going to like them this much I would have ordered more. Now I have an excuse to place another order soon. ;) Anyways, if you really need something like that, order more than one.\nI had worn it all day yesterday and found that the staying power is good as well. Mine stayed on for about 12 hours. I'm pretty sure it could last much longer than that, but I usually wash my makeup off at this point.\nOh! And I didn't find the spoolie too rough, as one of the reviewers mentioned. I have the spoolie from the \"Essentials\" line and I never find myself reaching for it because that one really IS rough and kind of \"sparse\" . I found this spoolie much softer and I started using it right away; didn't get the urge to grab my regular spoolie.\nSo yes, I would most definitely recommend this product if the shade matches you. It would be good if they would came out with more shades though. ;)",

I'd recommend it to someone who might be new to makeup but I probably will not purchase again",
