        "comments": "I dont find that its really an \"oil to foam\" but more like a gel. It does break down makeup and as a sahm who is exhausted at night, i love that i can skip that extra step and just use this. My face can feel tight and dry after using but i dont mind because i use hydrating things after. It doesnt burn my eyes and they are super sensitive. It also has seem to help clear a small brealput i had when i bought it. \n\nI do have one complaint…. The smell. Its bery earthy and strong. It reminds me of tea tree oil. Its gojng to take slme getting used to And i do have a cooling feeling when i use it. \n\nIm exploring korean skincare so i may try something else but i wpuld recommend trying this!",

Along with hormonal acne I also have dry sensitive skin that prone to clogged pores. I decided to give this cleanser a chance because why not I try them all anyways. But after using this for 2 days I can honestly say that I will never use anything else. It's the perfect consistency. Doesn't dry out the skin, removes every ounce of makeup possible. You skin is left feeling clean and not stripped at all. IT'S MY HOLY GRAIL now which is crazy for me to say because I have never had a holy grail cleanser I'm my entire life. This is chefs kiss!
