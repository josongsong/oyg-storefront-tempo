You can't move your face for 15 minutes after applying and you CANNOT apply it under makeup. It's like glue and foundation comes out highlighted under your eyes. \n\nTHIS STUFF started as a sample from somewhere and I'm about to buy more from Ulta! It smells like cucumbers, it's light and it works. Give it only a week and your undereyes are perfectly smooth. I'm not lying. That's why I looked it up online. Forget real expensive products, maybe they have incredible results, too. But this does it for me",

I am so glad I gave it a try.  This is very gentle and has improved the skin around my eyes profoundly.  My eyelids went from crepey to smooth after using this for a couple of weeks.  I started out using it every other day and now use it daily.  I live in a dry, arid climate and this does a great job combating the elements.  I have had co-workers remark on the improved appearance.  Love, love, love this product.",

Orange peel is sensitizing and should not be in skincare. I should have read the ingredients before using this product. The inclusion of orange peel totally defeats what this line is marketing itself as.",
