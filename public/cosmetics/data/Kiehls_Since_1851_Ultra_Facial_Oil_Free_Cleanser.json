I have used this for about 2 weeks now and it has made quite the difference in my ACNE PRONE, OILY skin. During the summer, I go from an occasional break out to a severe case of moderate acne--lots of whiteheads and a handful of nodules (the big painful ones that appear under your skin). I used this twice a day (morning and night) and it has done its part to control the acne  and treat it. TBH, I am thoroughly surprised it did as much as it does. I am going to keep using this for the summer and probably switch it out for the fall, but come back for it once the temperatures increase again. \n\nMy general routine with this product: \nCleanse\nOccasional exfoliator \nToner \nSerum \nMoisturizer",

I have tried everything from luxury to drug store cleansers: Kate Somerville, Dermalogica, Murad, Cetaphil, Mario Badescu, and Clean and Clear. Nothing worked as good as Kiehls cleanser. I have combination skin that is very oily in the summer and dry patches in the winter. The cleanser can feel like it is stripping your skin but if you have large pores, blackheads, and hormonal breakouts, it is worth it to combat the issues. My pores feel \"cleaned\" out. I have been using it for 4 weeks and my skin became more clear every day I used it. I no longer have weekly breakouts. I follow the cleanser with Clinique moisturizer and I only use the cleanser once a day.  I recommend this product if you have any of the following issues listed above.",

I have faithfully used Kiehl's products for over 5 years and have loved all of them, but I've been waiting for a collection that targets dehydrated skin without adding oil, or oily skin without over drying. I'm so happy this collection is finally here!\n\nI bought both the Ultra Facial Oil-Free Cleanser and Toner, and after using them for only 3 days now, I can already see an improvement in my skin. This new collection really cleans your skin without any drying effects. In fact, it actually locks moisture in! After only 3 days, my skin feels much softer and I've noticed that my skin is much less oily.\n\nI highly recommend the new Ultra Facial Oil-Free product line to anyone with oily, dehydrated skin. I'm sure other skin types would benefit as well.\n\nThank you Kiehl's for this wonderful product line!",

Don't get me wrong it might be great for really 'oily' skins but it doesn't work as well for my normal to oily skin. It also doesn't feel like it 'deep cleans' like the original product either.",
