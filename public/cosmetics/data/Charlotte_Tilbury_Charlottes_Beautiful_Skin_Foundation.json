Definitely not long term wear, but if youre looking for something lightweight/buildable and like the super dewy look it could work. Only super bad con is how easily it transfers on to anything one touch to the face and that spot has no foundation and its on whatever touched ur face. Makes products impossible to blend because the foundation underneath doesnt stay put.",

They always look very thick and cakey and oily, etc… \n\nI went in one day and one of the employees at my local Ulta recommended this one. I was hesitant at first and didn't buy it that day because of the price. Like I said, I've already spent a ton of money on foundations. I didn't like. I went back about a week later and got it. Had it shipped to my house cause they were out of stock. finally arrived. I let it sit on my counter. Has it to try it for about a week finally put it on last night with the airbrush pressed powder. I am obsessed. This is so smooth the color matches perfection, it looks like I have nothing on. It's very refreshing.",

I am fortunate to have clear skin with very small pores so there isn't a ton to cover other than some redness on my cheeks. The narrow tube with a pump is also fits more easily into a makeup bag than a chunky bottle and I don't worry about dropping and breaking it.

I usually need a foundation that looks beige without an orange or peach tint to it. I cant do pink undertone at all). \n\nI was walking past the CT stuff mostly looking at bronzers and eyeshadows, but my eye caught beautiful skin foundation in the shade 5n, and i thought that might work. I swatched it on my hand then on my jawline and it disappeared. I grabbed it off the shelf knowing I could return it if it didnt work, but it's an amazing foundation. It's definitely my favorite at the moment, and maybe HG. \n\n1. I have sensitive skin. This has no fragrance and i cant feel this on. I actually almost forgot to wash my face last night because i forgot i had makeup on. I usually cannot wait to wash my face at the end of the night. \n2. I have texture issues with large pores, old acne scars, some fine lines ( Im 40). I value blurring more than coverage and this blurs so well! It really lives up to the beautiful skin label because it does that— it gives the effect of just having better skin. Its not a full coverage foundation mask, but more like a blurring veil that evens out my skin. It works well over sunscreen, even mineral which is all i can wear. Ita difficult to find a foundation that plays well with mineral spf without adding unecessary texture. \n3. Holy moly this is actually long lasting. As a caveat i set this with powder, but i have to set all foundations with powder. I have oily skin. This lasts the entire day and i dont look oily at the end of the day. \n4. No shimmer. And its not dewy or matte.  Its a true skin like finish. \n5. Color match is perfect for me. \n6. I like the packaging. A tube with a pump. It travels easy and is easy to apply. Its more sanitary. \n\nI really hope this doesnt get discontinued or reformulated. I have tried hundreds of foundations and usually I hate them. I read this was reformulated once already, I've only tried this current version, but it's perfection!",

        "comments": "Influenster goodie. Here's my 2 cents: 1. Under the rose gold spell of this brand. It's a pretty. rand. It makes you wanna collect things because they look pretty on the vanity. This is no exception. As far as plastic packaging goes, it looks lovely and it matches her other items. The pump works well. Package is refillable so if you liked it and you got another foundation without a pump, you could put it into the rinsed tube when it runs out. #recycle Or if you buy two shades you can mix them into one (just pour some into a different container to save for later and add the second color, shake and mix) 2. Very sheer coverage as far as I'm concerned. I have very faint red marks and medium dark circles and I don't feel like this makes much of a difference. I have yet to find something lightweight that lives up to Hourglass' Hyluronic Tint. That one MELTS into my skin and it evens things out. 3. Texture. Yes. See pics. I feel like it emphasizes texture where there wasn't one. Can't explain this one but I would not wear it in sunlight. I have dry/ dehydrated skin with regular to small pores so texture is not really my concern other than skin products clinging to dry patches. This one definitely doesn't smooth over them. By comparison, Hourglass doesn't 4. Color. I have 2 Neutral and it's definitely warm on me. 5. Texture- runny. You have time to work with it. If you work with a sponge, a good amount will absorb into it. It feels lightweight on the skin. 6. I can't talk about the long term skincare benefits,  Influenster wants their review now. 7. No particular fragrance scent, it smells like foundation. 8. I wear it on zoom calls- my laptop camera is blurry enough to make the things that look off in person work on screen. I'm glad and very grateful that I have it. I can save my \"good\" foundation for going out.  9. Personally I will not be purchasing it. I will purchase other CT products instead and stick with the foundation that works for my skin.",
