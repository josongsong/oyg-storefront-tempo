The lip swatches shown on the dark skin women are not accurate at all and I suspect it's because they've been edited too heavily. The only accurate swatches are the one on the medium tone arm but I need it on a dark arm. We live in the digital age I need y'all to come with the color accuracy or you're getting all the returns.\n\nToffee is not giving any kind of pink or maybe I was led to believe it was. It's more like a camel brown. I HATE medium brown colored lip products on my dark skin. I feel like they make my complexion look dull and washed out. I will try and see if I'm compatible with some other colors because I really like the formula but I've tried other lipstick ranges meant to be nudes for dark skin by other black owned brands and, so far, this isn't competitive at all.",
