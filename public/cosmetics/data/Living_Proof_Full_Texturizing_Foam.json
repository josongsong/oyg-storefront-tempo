I section my hair and use it only at my roots, and prefer using leave in conditioner and serum on the lower half of my hair strands. For me, it would feel like too much product on the ends, making it hard to comb or brush through.",

I had it figured out when hair was a little longer, but trying to figure it out with new cut.  Used Full Dry Volume & Texture Spray after Full Moisturizing Foam.  These 2 products did not do that for me.   Hair feels like there is a weighted film of slightly sticky, greasy, damp feel.  Had to rewash hair. I will add that I'm not a fan of dry shampoo.  If you are, you may like it.  It's a no go for me.",

As someone with fine and thinning hair, finding the right styling product can be a challenge, so I welcomed giving this foam a try. \n\nThe Living Proof Full Texturizing Foam adds volume and texture to my hair without weighing it down or making it feel sticky. It's easy to apply and doesn't leave any residue behind. I love that it gives my hair a naturally fuller look that lasts all day.\n\nI also appreciate that this product is made without harmful chemicals like sulfates, parabens, and phthalates, making it a great choice for those who are conscious about the ingredients in their hair care products.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the Living Proof Full Texturizing Foam for anyone with fine or thinning hair who wants to add volume and texture to their style. It's a must-have in my hair care routine now and I will definitely be repurchasing it in the future. Thank you to Living Proof for creating such a fantastic product!\nThis product was complimentary from Living Proof",

I have very fine, thin hair and love mousse products to build volume in my normally flat hair. I think this foam does a decent job of providing volume but typically foam from a pump delivery system such as this does not give me the most volume. I think its great for every day but if I really want big hair, I have other mousse products that will give me the mega volume I am looking for. It certainly smells nice and does not dry my hair out, but would I purchase? Probably not. That being said, I have other Living Proof products I absolutely adore!",
