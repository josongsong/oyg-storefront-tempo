I have been experiencing dry flaky patches upon waking and late afternoon. This face cream has great ingredients and goes on nicely. It does not irritate but it's not hydrating enough for my dry patches. I have used several different Azelaic acid topicals for this issue and really need to find a better one. Perhaps if I do, this cream would be fine.",

I've never left a review before, but I felt the need to get on here and tell everyone to save their time and money. For context, I have dry skin and moisturize twice a day. This moisturizer does nothing to actually hydrate the skin, and it immediately pills all over the face. In just trying to rub it in, with NO other products on my face, it pilled and did not absorb in the slightest. I had to go wash it off. Now I have to take the time to go return it…",

The cream is thick but doesn't break me out or cause irritation anywhere on my face and neck. It also doesn't feel heavy on my oily/combination skin! 50g jar for the price it is isn't that bad. Although the packaging would be ideal if it came in a tube or with a different topper so air doesn't get in lessening the effectiveness of the ingredients.  The only scent of this product are the antioxidants. There is definitley no perfume smell! I would love if e.l.f. came out with a fragrance free under eye cream with the same benefits and added Spf 30 as this cream perhaps with added anti aging properties like a medical grade glycolic acid or hyluronic acid added to the mix? Just putting it out there...",

I found after about 3 days of use, my skin stared to feel tight. This was relieved by putting on the moisturiser but would only stop the tightness for an hour or 2 before applying again. Just after a week I started to get dry scaly patches around my face that this moisturiser did nothing for. After 2 weeks of use, trying to give it as good as a chance as possible, I just had to stop and go back to my usual moisturiser. If you have dry skin that isn't easily managed and need a thirst quenching moisturiser, this isn't it as much as I wish it was.",
