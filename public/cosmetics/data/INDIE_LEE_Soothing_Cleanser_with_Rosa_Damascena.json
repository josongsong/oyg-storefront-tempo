I will say the smell takes some getting used to. But it does what's on the packaging - cleanses and leaves my skin super soft. I'm only switching because of the cost.",

I would only rate 4 stars because I personally do not like the smell and wish it had less fragrance like most sensitive skin products do to prevent irritation. I also wish that it came in a trial size to test out first - although I know that this is a relatively new product so a trial size may come later. I would still say that it is worth the try to anyone looking for a good sensitive skin cleanser!",
