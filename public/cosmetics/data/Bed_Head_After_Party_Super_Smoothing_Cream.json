I bought it while it was on sale because I needed to add to my order for free shipping. I'm just being honest. So I only returned it because I already have some so I really didn't need a new one right now. I do always keep this product in my home. As a licensed cosmetologist this is a really great product. I always use it to smooth the hair and flyaways after styling. It works nicely if the hairspray you use is just a little to stiff and you want to smooth it without damaging the style you created. Bed head products also smell great. I use bed head masterpiece hairspray.",

I have tried many products when styling my wavy to curly hair, straight; this product is a go-to product that does deliver, especially in combination with Straighten-Out. I will be honest that I have never found a product that is my absolute favorite smoothing or straightening product; they all have their flaws, but this does a good job at a decent price point and I find myself unable to eliminate from my styling concoction. I know you curly-girls who straighten your hair feel the pain of finding the perfect product, too. This is worth a try for you.",

This was only my 2nd product I've tried by Bed Head, the After Party, and I'm in love! Even on less humid days, my hair is still frizzy, always. Since using this my frizz is down by more than half. I absolutely love the brightly colored bottle, lid is kind of oddly shaped. Easy to grasp, and hold while spraying onto my hair. I've use both with damp and dry hair, and the results we're equally just as great. I've been able to straighten my hair, while keeping my frizz lower. It makes my hair smell so good, I've gotten compliments. Not only on the smell, but also on some of my styles with it. People close notice the frizz is way lower, which I always dreaded. It's more shiny, less frizzy, feels more healthy. This cream isn't greasy, it doesn't weigh my hair down or feel scrunchy and hard. Plus it's good for all hair types. Now I'm excited to try more products from Bed Head, it's just what I needed and perfect timing. I've already recommended and will continue to do so.",

It's been about a year since I've discovered this about my hair so I'm always game for trying new products in general, but especially for controlling frizz. I was happy to receive this product, hoping it might solve my frizz problem. Sadly, it did not. Since my hair is more on the fine side I cannot use too much product without risking weighing my waves and curls down. If my hair was all flat, I wouldn't care. So even when using this product, my hair still ends up frizzy. Maybe it's because I'm not using \"enough\" but you would think that using the two pumps on damp hair would be enough—I use a microfiber towel for goodness sakes! I also don't blow dry/diffuse my hair because it doesn't work for me, so I didn't bother doing that when testing out the product (and based on some other reviews, blow drying doesn't make much of a difference anyway). I was hoping to love or just like this product, but I don't. I might give this product to a friend with hair that can handle it. I don't give it one star simply because I did enjoy the scent a lot.",
