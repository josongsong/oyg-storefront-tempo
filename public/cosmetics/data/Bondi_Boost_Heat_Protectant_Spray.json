I put this on my hair twice and both times my hair felt dry and frizzy after. This was when wet. After blow drying my hair looked frizzy. The spray bottle was a nigtmare. I had to use both hands to push down on it for anything to come out. Eventually I poured it in another spray bottle to use. I like that it has a light scent , but for the price it was not that good. Will not purchase again.",

While i have yet to see a dramatic reduction of thinning (only been using for about a week), every product has proven to have a significant impact on the thickness and health of my hair. \n\nThis serum, actually comes out of a twist top, as opposed to the spray bottle that is pictured, but i think it works best like that. I apply it every night before bed and every morning i wake up and my hair feels fuller and looks better and is never greasy. I have very fine hair so that is a big plus for me. Also it smells amazing! I am all in on this brand! Cant wait to discover what else they have to offer!!",

        "comments": "My hair is very wiry, thin, brittle, and prone to breakage. So naturally, I decided to try to grow it out shoulder length. My reviews are based on how products have helped or hindered that effort.. I started off using the Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate line. After a year, my hair was actually SHORTER. I finally read the ingredients and Redken products contain alcohol, which is very bad for my hair. I switched to Bondi Boost products and the results have been AMAZING!! I have noticed significant new growth, less breakage, and my hair is fuller, longer, stronger, and softer. These products have been game changers in my hair growth journey. I use this at night, prior to bedtime, and I have noticed significant new growth\n\nDISCLAIMER: During the same period, I did over color my hair, had to strip the color, bleach it, and re-color it. That process is most likely responsible for a great deal of damage and loss of length; probably more so than the Redken products. I also started scalp treatments, more frequent shampooing, and a change of styling products. Therefore the loss of length and lack of growth can not be totally attributed to those products, but I am still much happier with Bondi Boost.",

        "comments": "I dye my whole head of hair, and I can see growth right away. I have also tried sprays and oils, and the reason I prefer this application is because it distributes down my scalp without having to spray a bunch of areas. My problem with oils is that it only stays overnight or for a few hours, and I can't bring myself to oil my hair that often for them to work. I can easily fit this product into my routine and use after I wash my hair, and it stays working until the next wash, I feel like that's why it works so well. I've been told by several people that my hair's getting longer. Keep in mind, this won't really create new growth for thinning areas, you would have to use oils or rosemary for that- but it's amazing at making your hair grow quicker",

        "comments": "I was very confused by the comments that stated the product is \"greasy\" because it had the exact opposite effect on my hair - left it extremely dry & itchy. I compared the ingredients listed on the Ulta site vs the Bondi Boost site, and they DO NOT COMPARE! Some of the ingredients listed on Ulta include Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Coconut Fragrance Oil, Raspberry Flavour & Lactic Acid. There are NO OILS at all listed on the Bondi Boost site nor is there Raspberry Flavour & Lactic Acid. Coffee Seed Extract is the 2nd ingredient & get this. Although Ulta names the product \"Procapil Hair Tonic\" as well as on the image; look closely. You will not find the 3% Procapil included in their ingredients list. For reference, the bottle I purchased from Ulta has the same ingredients that are listed on the Bondi website which again does not have any oils in it at all. The product leaves my scalp VERY ITCHY & my 3C/4A hair EXTREMELY DRY! \nSEE FOR YOURSELF….ULTA INGREDIENTS LIST: *Aloe Vera Leaf Juice , Saw Palmetto Extract, Glycerin /Aqua /Sodium Levulinate /Sodium Anisate, Butylene Glycol /Aqua /PPG-26-Buteth-26 /PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil /Apigenin /Oleanolic Acid /Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, Glycerin /Aqua  /Avena Strigosa Seed Extract /Lecithin /Potassium Sorbate /Citric Acid, Horsetail Extract, Coffee Arabica Seed Extract, Ethyl Macadamiate, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, *Nettle Leaf Extract, *Glycerine Vegetable, Coconut Fragrance Oil, Raspberry Flavour, Lactic Acid.\n\nBONDI'S INGREDIENTS LIST: Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice*, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract*, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail) Leaf Extract, 3% Procapil®, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract*, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract*, Serenoa Serrulata (Saw Palmetto) Fruit Extract*, Glycerin, Panthenol (Pro Vitamin B5), Coco-Caprylate, Polysorbate-20, Fragrance, Pentylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexyglycerin, Citric Acid",
