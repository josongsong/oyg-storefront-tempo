If you're like me, then this product is not for you.\n\nTherefore this product does what it advertised: a gentle scrub.",

I thought it was maybe just a coincidence so I removed it from my regimine and waited for my skin to clear up. I then reintroduced it and it broke me out again, the morning after I used it! Very unfortunate as it is not the most affordable product",
