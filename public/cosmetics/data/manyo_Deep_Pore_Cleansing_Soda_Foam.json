I was surprised that such a small amount does the job - about a dime size dollop,  it foams and it's nice and silky, will not irritate the skin, If you have issued with clogged pores, just make sure you leave it on your skin for a few minutes so it can be more effective at dissolving and breaking down the build up that accumulates inside facial pores.",

This cleanses my pores deep and leaves my face nice and smooth afterwards. It also has a gentle pleasant smell to it, but it doesn't irritate my skin (I have sensitive skin). I will continue to buy this, it exceeded my expectations!",
