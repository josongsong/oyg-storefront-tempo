I currently use a really old one that somehow hasnt dried out but is on its last legs. I bought a backup and finally tried it and they massacred my favorite eyeliner. Its almost squeaky trying to apply it and it keeps dragging and skipping. It dried down to a SUPER shiny finish which looks like rubber and tbh feels like rubber on my eyes, I can physically feel the wing sitting on my skin. This is now my least favorite eyeliner of all time and im mouring. If you loved this eyeliner this will do nothing for you I promise.",

I followed what others said about storing it upside down and it fixed it. It definitely stays and seems like a same or similar formula to before, but the applicator and the fact I have to store it like that is terrible. I recommend looking for another eyeliner, this isnt it. KVD has gone downhill, Im so bummed. They wouldnt let me return either.",

        "comments": "Why did they have to go and ruin the best eyeliner of all time?!  I worked in cosmetics for 10 years and fell in love with this liner.  I was apprehensive about them reformulating, and sadly for me, it completely ruined the product.  \nI NEVER had this liner crease up on my lid before, and now the reformulation does.  I have tried 3 tubes to make sure it wasn't just a one-off, but sadly it creases after 7-8 hours.  That may sound good, but that means after the work day, my eyelids are sticking and the liner transfers before I can go out after work.\n\nI have tried dozens of other liners and have yet to find a perfect replacement, as many are not the brush tip I love, or they crease/smudge much faster.  The closest I've found in formula is the Rare Beauty one, though the packaging shape is a little different to get used to (designed to be easier to grip though for people with hand dexterity issues).\n\nRIP to the greatest liquid liner of all time. 🪦",

        "comments": "Hey beauties! 💖 Today, I am beyond excited to share my thoughts on a product that has completely revolutionized my eyeliner game – the KVD Tattoo Liner in the shade Trooper Black 10. If you're searching for that perfect, go-to eyeliner, keep reading because this might just be it!\n\n🖤The packaging is sleek, chic, and edgy – exactly what you'd expect from KVD Beauty. But it's what's inside that truly counts. This iconic waterproof liquid eyeliner boasts tattoo-bold pigment and a needle-precise brush tip that makes drawing the thinnest, sharpest lines an absolute breeze. And trust me, when I say precise, I mean it! The ultra-fine bristles glide effortlessly between each lash, giving you smooth, gap-free lines every single time. Whether you're aiming for a subtle day look or a dramatic wing, this liner delivers. Plus it dries almost instantly. \n\n🖤One of the standout features for me is how user-friendly it is. The flexible tip hugs your lash line beautifully, giving you total control. It's incredibly easy to draw a fine line with just light pressure – perfect for those crisp, sharp wings that everyone loves. If you're feeling bolder, a bit more pressure will give you a thicker, more dramatic line. The versatility of this formula is genuinely impressive. I've used it to create everything from classic winged liner to more graphic, editorial looks. It even doubles up for faux freckles and brow detailing if you're feeling extra creative.\n\n🖤The performance is stellar. As someone with oily eyelids, finding a liner that stays put all day is a challenge. But the KVD Tattoo Liner is long-wear, smudge-resistant, and waterproof. It stays flawless from morning to night without a hint of smudging or fading. Whether you're sweating it out at the gym or caught in a rain shower, this liner won't budge. High-performance is an understatement – it truly lives up to its name.\n\n🖤A couple of pro tips: For best results, store your Tattoo Liner flat and give it a good shake before use. If the tip feels a bit dry, simply wipe it with a damp tissue to remove any eyeshadow build-up. This little trick keeps the ink flowing perfectly every time.\n\n🖤Oh, and did I mention it's 100% vegan and cruelty-free? It feels amazing to use a product that aligns with my values and performs so well.\n\n🖤 The KVD Tattoo Liner in Trooper Black 10 has quickly become a staple in my makeup routine. Its precision, staying power, and versatility make it a must-have for anyone who loves a fierce eyeliner look. Whether you're a makeup newbie or a seasoned pro, this liner is sure to impress. Go ahead and give it a try – your eyeliner game will never be the same! 💫",

        "comments": "I never post reviews, but this eyeliner was so infuriating to me that here I am. Like many other reviewers, I'm a long time user of Kat Von D's tattoo liner, but this new formula makes it worse than any eyeliner I've ever used. \n\nThe applicator is so hit or miss -- you either get an onslaught of eyeliner or hardly anything at all.\n\nBut I've dealt with annoying applicators, that's not a deal breaker for me. But this eyeliner somehow manages to transfer onto my eyelid during normal wear (and I've tried every combination of setting spray and setting powder and nothing has helped) while simultaneously being absolutely impossible to get off at night when I take my makeup off. I use an oil cleanser and a regular cleanser, have started scrubbing my eyes, and I STILL wake up in the morning with flakes of eyeliner smeared on my face. I literally exchanged the first one I got because I thought the one I'd bought was just defective. Nope.\n\nWherever this formula was \"clinically reformulated,\" it was not on planet earth.",
