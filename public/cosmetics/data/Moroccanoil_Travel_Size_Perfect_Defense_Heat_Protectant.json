I thought it would offer some benefits other than heat protectant like softening or hydration but none, zero, nada. Also ALLLL of the reviews on ULTA are paid reviews. I've tried posting my negative review three times and it won't let me. Seems fishy tbh. Anyways this heat protectant feels like a hairspray going on as well, if you have fine hair that doesn't hold a curl maybe this is for you. But personally this is not my fave.",

The texture is very light, so it doesn't weigh my hair down or make it greasy, which is something I often worry about with sprays. It goes on evenly, dries quickly, and leaves a nice soft feeling without any stickiness.\n\nThe smell is also amazing — fresh but not overpowering, and it lingers just a little bit after styling. I noticed that after blow-drying and straightening, my hair looks smoother and shinier, and it doesn't feel as dry on the ends as it usually does.\n\nThe size is also very convenient — easy to throw in a bag if you're traveling or going to the gym. Overall, it has become a really useful step in my routine, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to protect their hair from heat damage while keeping it soft and healthy.

        "comments": "This heat protectant SUCKS. It dries my hair out every time doesn't provide any hydration. I have slightly thick wavy hair and it is dry and slightly damaged. I thought it would offer some benefits other than heat protectant like softening or hydration but none, zero, nada. Also ALLLL of the reviews on ULTA are paid reviews. I've tried posting my negative review three times and it won't let me. Seems fishy tbh. Anyways this heat protectant feels like a hairspray going on as well, if you have fine hair that doesn't hold a curl maybe this is for you. But personally this is not my fave.",
