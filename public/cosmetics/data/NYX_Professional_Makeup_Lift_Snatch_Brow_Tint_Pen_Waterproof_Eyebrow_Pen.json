Nowhere on the packaging does it say its waterproof & the pen does not say its waterproof. Why does the description say its waterproof?!! It smears easily with water and sweat, plus it turns a horrible orange color after spending time in the sun :(",

People have asked me if I got my eyebrows microbladed. I also use this pen to give me false freckles.",

        "comments": "I've gone through two of these in Ash Brown and have had no issues with the tip bleeding or weird undertones. The shade Ash Brown is a neutral-cool medium brown tone that doesn't look too stark against my naturally very dark brown brows. I use this to fill in sparse areas and it's very easy to create hair-like strokes that look natural and not over-done. The tube lasts months with regular use. Bonus: it doubles as an eyeliner and makes for a killer wing thanks to the ultra-fine tip.\n\nHOWEVER... It is absolutely NOT waterproof. I've swatched it on my hand and watched the product rinse away under running water without rubbing. If you touch your brows with a damp hand, it will run and fade. I've tested it while swimming and it didn't stand a chance. How they get away with marketing it as \"waterproof\" is a mystery to me. It performs very poorly under wet or sweaty conditions. That said, I do love the way it makes my brows look and it doesn't give me any issues on the (dry) day-to-day.",

        "comments": "This super fine point, waterproof formula is a fabulous job creating perfect winged eyeliner. Eye line, my eyes with my normal eyeliner and then use the NYX Lift & Snatch pen in a matching color to draw on perfect wings, whether I want them tiny little triangles or long drawn out points. Stains the skin well so that if it lightens up during the day from make up etc you can see exactly where to draw it back on perfectly. I've never even tried to use it as a brow pen. It's just that perfect for wings and I've recommended it to many people. I prefer the colors brunette, caramel, and auburn, depending on how dark my brown eyeliner is and how dramatic I want to be. Of course, black for high-drama days. Try you won't be disappointed!",

Sometimes it will seem like it's dried up and then suddenly the next day, without anything having changed, it's bleeding excess ink. Also going on a plane/through elevation changes with it makes it bleed (even when it's 3 months old). I don't get it at all, but when it bleeds I just wipe away the excess.",

I won't lie this pen does require some practice and a very light hand since it's very pigmented but once you get the hang of it you can create beautiful natural looking brows!! Remember the little hair strokes don't have to be perfect just don't put much pressure on the pen itself! In the picture I only used this pen and some brow gel that's it! I will be getting other colors for my clients as I am a makeup artist. Definitely recommend it!!",

So I decided I needed to take it apart and find out where all the liquid was, if it was dried up inside or maybe it was just plugged somehow. What I discovered was very disappointing, to say the least. I could hear that ball inside the bulk of the pen... where you would expect the well to be, like your regular writing or gel pens or markers... if you have or have had one of these pens, you know what I'm talking about. Just like fingernail polish, I would shake this pen, before using it and when it started drying out but it never seemed to help. \n\nUpon taking this pen apart, I discovered there was NEVER any liquid in the well or reservoir... where the ball is. It's just an empty tube with a little steel ball in it, rattling around to make you think there's something in there! You can tell from how clean and shiny the ball is, that there was never any eyebrow tint anywhere near it. I even ran a q-tip down through it to double check for any tint... none. \n\nThe little brush has a short, thin part that is hidden down inside the pen... this is what holds the liquid and that is all... there's is no sign of eyebrow tint anywhere else in this whole pen! Now, if you ask me, if someone starts out deceptive, they know that they're in the wrong, to begin with and who can trust a company that is going to these lengths to deceive the customer??? Don't believe me...? Take one apart yourself and see what you find...",
