It doesn't disperse like a spray; it just shot it onto my hair. I combed it through and then realized it smells SO HORRIBLE. Kenra's scents are usually so good and something I love most about the brand, but this one is a huge miss! I probably should have just rinsed it out but instead applied two more products in order to slightly mask the stinch.",

I let it air dry thinking once it dried the smell would go away, but no. So I rinsed my hair out very well without shampooing and the smell was gone. \n\nAfter it dried the second time my hair felt nice and soft and silky. Kind of a waste to use a leave in if I just have to rinse it out. Taking this back to the store.",

This is not to be used on the top of your head, or on the scalp. Of course its gonna be weighed down. I wash, towel dry a bit, and spray this into my hands. 4-6 pumps is plenty for me. Then i work into my ends. After i learned to do it this way i learned that i love this product and want to try some of the other things from the gold line. Still i hate the smell. But no worries it fades into a nicer smell on my hair.",

        "comments": "I had to write a review for this because when I was deciding to buy it, it seems like there are a lot of negative reviews for small reasons. Yes, the product comes in a spray bottle but it's a light lotion like texture so you need to spray it in your hands first and then spread through the hair. It's very similar in texture to the OUAI Leave-In but has more slip. The OUAI one is also in a spray bottle but is too thick to spray directly on the hair. This packaging mishap could bother some, but as someone with very fine hair, I have to spray into my hands first even with actual sprays sometimes otherwise too much product will get onto my hair and weigh it down. A lot of reviews are complaining about build up on the scalp… this is a leave in product which you generally want to avoid putting on hair above your neck. Yes, if I put product on the top of my head, of course I'm going to get build up, that goes for more hair products. Stick to the lengths of the hair and you're good! I would NOT use this as a heat protector for already dried hair, I'd use an aerosol spray for styling dried hair. Overall, I love this product, I like that I can either air dry or blow dry my hair with it, and also add a little extra shine and smoothness on 2nd or 3rd day hair that needs a little TLC.",

The spray has more of a lotion like substance but can still come out in spray form if you pump it quickly enough. I either work it into the ends of my long hair and comb through while dry, or spray through mid to ends while wet and then blow dry. I saw some other reviews say that it left hair greasy, but I didn't have a problem with that, just stay away from spraying into roots of hair and remember that a little goes a long way. 😉 I've had so many compliments on my hair since using this. Am definitely hooked and will be restocking as soon as I run out.",

This product is the same consistency as lotion so be careful. It does give great shine and it smells absolutely amazing, but it is not for everyone. I personally think that it is a heavy product. It works well with taming frizz and is good for us curly hair girls that experience the humidity crisis in the summer, but I would not use this on straight light colored hair because it could give off a greasy look. They will probably end up discontinuing this or remarketing towards ethnic hair after they see how many people return this product. I'll be keeping mine because I can use it on wet curls, but I will not apply any heat after using this. My husband also liked the smell of my hair.",
