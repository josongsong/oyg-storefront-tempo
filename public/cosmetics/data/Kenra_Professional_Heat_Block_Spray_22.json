While it isn't really meant for use with a straightener, I use it for that anyway because it helps keep my hair from curling back up during the day.  I have naturally curly hair and it doesn't like staying straight, but it will stay straight all day if I use this while straightening it.  Once my hair cools off, I just run my fingers through it and my hair is back to being soft and pliable.  Highly recommend this product.",

This feels like hairspray and doesnt leave your hair soft after. Curling irons and straightners do not run over the hair easily after using and the hair feels stiff. Also the smell reminds me of an air freahner in a public bathroom, not what I want to smell on myself all day.",

I felt like this built up on my hair and caused it to feel and look dry, and im not sure if the heat protection worked well because my hair did look damaged.",

The scent is very nice, the mist dries instantly once applied and you can still run your fingers through your hair with no build up. Your hair releases so nice from a straight iron and add a beautiful shine to the hair...just gorgeous. Is also a great finishing spray once style is achieved with medium hold... also adds great volume..especially for me who has long hair and loves volume on top.",

Its called heat block spray which seems like it would be a heat protector for straightening and curling etc.. So I washed & blow dried my hair and as my flat iron was heating up I sprayed a section of my hair and the texture was sticky and coarse like hair spray. It was impossible to straighten more or less run my fingers through the sprayed section.. It frustrated me, and I ended up just throwing my hair in a bun and not styling how I was planning that day. \n\nNow, using it as a light weight hair spray is great.. But I already had one (and it was properly labeled as hair spray) and didn't need another one. They should really change the name of this product and call it was it is because it is certainly not anything like a \"heat blocker\".",
