The first time I tried this, I didn't notice much of a difference and I still had a little wave at the root. Also wasn't a huge fan of the smell. I thought I hadn't used enough product so decided to try it again a few weeks later and was left with frizzy ends. I just tried it again for the 3rd time in 3 months and my hair feels SO gross after this round: the residue makes it feel like my hair hasn't been washed in weeks (I just washed today) and I can't get a brush through it without a ton of breakage. Blow drying today was a nightmare and if I didn't have somewhere to be in an hour, I would've washed my hair again just to get this stuff out of it. If you have fine, wavy hair, I wouldn't recommend this.",

Its been hours now and my hands are still tingling. Whats in this? It cant be safe! Even if i wear gloves and also not fet it on my scalp, my hair will be touching rhe skin on my neck and shoulders. \nTho it works well, I'll be returning Dream Coat.

        "comments": "At first I had thought this product was heavy and greasy until I realized it was actually a new conditioner I had used. This is in fact light weight. It leaves zero residue and as stated, you can use as much as you like and it doesn't negatively affect the hair. I parted my hair in sections and thoroughly sprayed root to ends. With that said, if you have long hair like mine, you have to imagine this wouldn't go incredibly far even with the 3-4 shampoos promise. With a hefty price tag, that's not a positive unless it's miraculous results. As instructed, I applied to wet hair, as well. I used a brush through dryer. FYI, if you get a good one, those things are great! In the end, I saw some nice shine, but it wasn't like glass even with careful hair straightening after the drying. It did look nice, smooth and healthy so I'll give it points for that. As far as humidity, I live in a sauna during the summer and moisture filled winters. It kills any hopes of straight, frizz free hair for me. I end up just letting it do it's thing and not fight it. My hair is loose wavy. This seemed to protect from humidity pretty dang well. I was really impressed by that. Are there cheaper products that will do the same? Possibly. I'd have to investigate further. That alone doesn't win me over with the price of this particular product. It states that this lasts for 3-4 shampoos and I have to say it seemed to continue with its protection with the first. I only wash my hair twice a week. You would have to take that into consideration. Is it the actual washes or days? When I washed the second time after a few days, it wasn't a noticeable staying power. In all honesty, this is a good product. My hair had some shine although it was nothing magnificent. It had a nice smoothness, but again, nothing mind blowing. There wasn't noticeable staying power for me. It did live up to the humidity protection. With making certain the hair is coated and taking into consideration the amount of hair one has, the lasting quality of the bottles don't look too promising. It has a light scent however nothing memorable. It's pretty neutral. There's no stickiness. It doesn't mat the hair and actually seems to help with comb through. To sum it up, I can't quite scream the praise. For the price tag, it should live up to the hype a considerable bit more that what it does. It should certainly have a longer life span. Maybe others found the jackpot here, but I don't see myself spending the money again unless I just can't find the humidity control in something cheaper. Nothing magical stood out. I would have expected better with all the glorious statements and videos. I think a lot of what we miss when watching these videos are the use of the other products to achieve the results they get. Notice it isn't just the Dream Coat. That's hundreds of dollars on products to even attempt high-end, salon quality results which is what they are suggesting here.",

        "comments": "My hair is down to the middle of my back I mean LONGGG. It's really thick, curly, coarse, frizzy, and dry. Doesn't matter what I put in it, my hair always looks dry and frizzy. I used the 6.7 oz bottle and it lasted me 5 washes. The only times it worked were when I would absolutely soak my hair from root to tip with dream coat and then dried my hair instantly. Couldn't let my hair air dry and then blow it dry or it wouldn't work either. Obviously this makes this product ridiculously expensive for me. That being said, when I soaked my hair with the spray and dried it instantly (says on the bottle but in case you missed it you can't use any other products out of the shower with it. I didn't even attempt to and I'm glad I didn't because it works) my hair was softer, smoother, and instead of poofing up and being light weight and all over the place it actually had weight to it that kept it looking and feeling like naturally pin straight hair. If you have my hair type you know what I'm talking about. I've tried so many products throughout the years (I'm 30) and nothing has ever done this to my hair. No amount of straightening has done this- nothing has. Also for reference I use a giant round brush- the biggest out there, and blow dry my hair smooth and I do get every curl and kink out that way. Again, I've been doing this for years and it comes easy to me for some reason. Probably the giant round brush. Got it from Ulta, it's ceramic with wire bristles in case you have my hair type. I also have to put that flat nozzle on my blow dryer or it won't work so you can try that too. High heat and high air flow setting on the blow dryer as well. In order to get the naturally pin straight results I have to blow dry like that and straighten it then hair spray. But it works. I'm trying the big bottle now to see how long it lasts. If it runs out in a few months (I wash my hair 1-2 times a week) then I'll have to buy it like once a year and go without most of the time because it's too much. I hope they lower the price one day if other people are having this issue too because the results when you figure out how you need to use it for your hair, are amazing. Hope this was helpful and not an hour wasted reading this chapter book review. You're welcome or I'm sorry.",
