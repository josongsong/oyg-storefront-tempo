It shouldn't be, because I've yet to meet a Naturium product I haven't loved! The brand somehow provides a very upscale product line at the most reasonable prices. The packaging is perfection! A squeeze tube where I don't need to dip my finger into a pot? Sign me up! It's the perfect consistency and texture - not too thick but thick enough it feels super hydrating going on, and continues to provide moisture throughout the day.

The Glow Getter Body Wash is a perfect example - it's a 20/10 for me! I also have some serums I love so decided to try the eye cream. So far, it's great! The tube packaging is something I REALLY appreciate, as I hate dipping my fingers into a jar. The consistency is perfect! Not too liquidy but not too thick. Does a great job of moisturizing the delicate skin underneath my eyes. Even my husband uses it! Gentle on skin, we will see how it hold up to my dry winter skin. So far, it's another win for Naturium!",
