First of all it's great and simple style of the product which will fit nicely in your bathroom shelf.I was using this cream for 4 weeks and I can tell you that my skin looks more hydrated and glowing.The cream has a nice texture,easy for absorbing and there is no distinctive sense which can be a bonus.It can be a great base for makeup,your skin after use isn't oily and foundation cream goes smoothly on this cream.Also I noticed not many creams have a SPF factor and this cream does which can be very handy for sunny summer days ahead. It's great value for money and I definitely will buy it again.It does moisturize my skin well and it suits my sensitive skin as well I didn't see any bad reaction after using it!",

        "comments": "I used this for some time and love the creamy moisturiser, but I've stopped using it now they've changed to this horrible tube from the old dispenser. I can't get the stuff out of the tube! I thought it was just me as I have arthritis in my hands but reading other reviews realise lots of other people are complaining about this. The moisturiser is very difficult to squeeze out and you can't get it all out of the tube, so the only way to use up all the product is to cut the tube open with scissors and then put cling film over it to stop it drying out. Really poor.",
