So I dont know if I left it on too long. I still will contunue to buy. Would I say its s good value? Not really. Worth it? Yes.",

I don't go as high as one of the pictures I saw in the reviews...I leave just enough room to do my liner/shadow on my lower lids. I have them on for a good 30-40 minutes and when I remove them I look like I got a great night's sleep, even when I didn't.  \n\nI get full coverage of my under eye area.  They are large enough where I can't imagine anybody at all having an issue with this. They say firmly in place, no slipping or sliding, even tho there is more than enough serum on them. They definitely have not dried out completely when I remove them. \n\nSince these are used immediately after I wash my face I always keep a set for the next day and after applying a caffeine based serum I put the same set back on so that I get 2 days of use with each pair. Once again, no issue with them not staying in place.\n\nI've Always had a problem with getting enough sleep at night...I try bur it just doesn't happen but because of these patches nobody would ever know that I'm a night owl. Highly recommend adding these to your morning regimine!",

After an overindulgent night, and waking up in the morning with puffy , dark, dry wrinkly eyes, I slapped these patches on & 30 minutes later , my under eye area looked refreshed! I wish I would've taken before & after pics, it was that noticeable. I cant say how long it's lasted, but for two bucks , it's worth it even for a temporary fix! I wish they made these for lids !",
