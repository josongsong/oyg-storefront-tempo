Every time I used the Clinique exfoliator—even just once a week—I would break out really badly, sometimes with two or more new pimples each time. I've spoken with others who've used it, and many said it didn't cause purging or breakouts for them, so it clearly varies from person to person. Unfortunately, for me, it caused more harm than good. If you have acne-prone or sensitive skin, I'd definitely recommend patch-testing before committing.",

I wish I new beforehand that this contains alcohol, then I would never have purchased it. Thankfully I am still in the return window and will bring this to an Ulta store right away. If you have sensistive skin and are sensitive to alcohol scent, you should better look for a different face lotion. I would not recommend this lotion at all!",
