I stumbled apon this brand when looking for a good, affordable, addative/ carginogen free skin cleanser. It has been so wonderful on my combonation skin through the winter, spring and the beginning heat of the summer to come. This is one of those products I continue to share with others because it really is that good!! As for the product itself its a clear gel cleanser which is very gentile on the skin. It does get bubbly but not sudsy. I use it in combation with various other good molecules products and it has kept my skin looking so very clear. Overall I love this product and its quality is uncomparable ! I reccommend to any and all !!",

I did my research, found this brand, and gave it a try. For context, I used this face wash and the Good Molecules daily moisturizer twice a day (and nothing else) and within 4 days I could tell a noticable difference! I absolutely love it and my face feels very clean and soft!! A few notes: 1) a little bit goes a long way, which makes it pretty affordable; and 2) it doesn't foam/bubble up in the way most others work but that's due to the clean ingredients. While I found this product to contain clean/healthy ingredients and provide amazing results, I recommend everyone do their research on the ingredients within their skincare products and find what works best for them.",

It leaves my skin simply CLEAN, and ready for rejuvenation from my next steps --moisturizers and serums. I really don't have any \"cons\" for this, unless you want your cleanser to go above and beyond cleansing (though that seems like a tough game to play, and usually backfires when formulas try to do too much -- I always say, leave it to the treatments) And no over-drying means adult-acne-free for me (except for those couple of hormonal days haha but I wouldn't expect a cleanser to tackle that) :)",
