Its kind of buildable but even then it smears so easily. I put in on 1 hour ago just to see the color already fading so i just wiped it softly and everything came off. Not waterproof either! For 25 youre better off getting a NYX or elf liner.",

I can get a passable result with powdered eyeshadow and a dampened super-fine eyeliner brush (or a flattened push brush), but it is a painstaking process for me.  MAC Brushstroke (Brushback color) is faster and easier for me to apply.  The line isn't quite as precise or as fine as with a push brush, but the result seems more crisp than with the black eyeliner pencils I've tried.  It is easier for me to draw a wing with its pointed-flex applicator tip than with a firm pencil, too.  I've only used this on my upper lash line, and it stays on better than expected.  It seems rub-proof, so when I make a mistake, it takes a wet cotton bud and a decent amount of pressure to fix it; it does wash off easily with my usual foaming cleanser.  I haven't noticed anything irritating about the formulation.  So far, so good.",

Until I happily discovered that MAC came out with the BRUSTROKE LINER! This is by leaps & bounds the best liquid marker eyeliner out there and I swear I've tried them all! As long as you treat it like a marker in your hand & take your time, you basically cannot make a mistake! I can make the thinnest, most delicate line or the thickest, most bold line I choose, it's kind of the choose your own adventure of eye liners! If I mess up, it's quite easy to fix either by going over it again with another stroke or using a q-tip to fix my flub...it typically does not smudge everywhere as long as I am careful not to drag it. It's all in the care you take though, as with anything...you need to slow down, stay close to your lash line, make sure you're light-handed to start (you can always add more...it's harder to subtract if you do too much!) and you'll be good to go! I am the costume and makeup director for a dance company and this liner POPS on stage. Enough gushing...you MUST try this product if you love a no muss, no fuss, perfect, rich, bold black defined eye! (unless you're using the brown...which gives good color too, I just tend to used the black more regularly.)\n\nMy ONLY complaint is that there aren't enough color options...I am ALWAYS looking for a good dark purple liner in this formulation with the same lasting power and maybe a dark green. PRETTY PLEASE MAC...MAKE MORE COLORS IN THE BRUSTROKE LINER!!!",
