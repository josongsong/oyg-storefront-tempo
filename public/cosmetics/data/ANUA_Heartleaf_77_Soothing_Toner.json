If you have money to spare give it a try but I can't in good faith recommend this product. I have been using it for a month straight, morning and night, with no positive results! Also the bottle is not flexible which can make it hard to apply if you have an agular or boney face like me.",

I think I'm allergic to some of the plant extracts they use in this product. I have super sensitive skin and I suffer from a lot of plant allergies seasonally so i'm assuming since this product is heavily made with all sorts of plant extracts, that might be whats causing the allergic reaction. Not safe or gentle for those with allergies to plants and flowers. Sucks but i will be returning this one.",

This K-Beauty gem, has a high concentration of Houttuynia Cordata Extract (Heartleaf), promises to soothe irritated skin, control oil production, and hydrate effectively. Let's delve deeper into what makes this toner a potential game-changer for many.\n\nKey Ingredients and Their Benefits:\n\nHouttuynia Cordata Extract (77%): The star of the show! Heartleaf possesses potent anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidant properties. It helps calm redness, reduce breakouts, and protect the skin from environmental stressors.\nPanthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5): A powerful humectant that draws moisture from the air and deeply hydrates the skin, leaving it plump and supple.\nBetaine: A natural amino acid that provides gentle exfoliation, improves skin texture, and helps maintain optimal hydration levels.\nAllantoin: A soothing agent that calms irritation and accelerates skin cell turnover, promoting a smoother, more even complexion. \nThis toner is particularly well-suited for all skin types. While particularly beneficial for sensitive and acne-prone skin, the hydrating and soothing properties can benefit most skin types.\nThe toner has a lightweight, watery consistency that absorbs quickly into my skin without leaving any sticky residue. I apply directly to my face with a cotton pad or hands, followed by gentle patting for better absorption.\n\nI experienced a noticeable calming effect on my skin after application. Redness and irritation are visibly reduced, and my skin feels refreshed and hydrated. The toner also leaves a subtle glow, making it a great base for the rest of my skincare routine.",

        "comments": "I had high hopes when I tried the Heartleaf 77 Soothing Toner, especially given its claims to soothe and hydrate sensitive, dry skin. With 77% Heartleaf extract as the main ingredient, it's designed to calm the skin, which sounded like exactly what my skin needed. The texture of the toner is light and refreshing, and it absorbs quickly, leaving no sticky residue, which I appreciated. However, after using it for a few weeks, I didn't notice any dramatic changes in my skin's overall appearance, texture, or hydration levels. It didn't irritate my skin, which is a definite plus for anyone with sensitive skin like mine. But unfortunately, it didn't deliver on its promise to add extra hydration or provide significant relief from dryness. It felt more like a basic toner rather than something that deeply nourishes or soothes, which is what I was hoping for. While I didn't see noticeable improvements, I can see how this product could be a good option for people who want a gentle toner that won't disrupt the skin's natural balance. It's a great option if you're looking for something mild, but for those with more demanding skin concerns, it may not offer the extra boost you need.",
