After using it for a week or so I started experiencing the most painful breakout above my lips (area right under my nose). The pimples even came in clusters!! It was horrible, and as soon as I stopped using this specific product and went back to my previous cleanser my face cleared up. Not to mention the smell was also disgusting. Will never purchase again :(",

I love the consistency of the gel as well and the amount of product will last me a long time. Overall, I would buy again.\nI wouldn't recommend for sensitive, dry skinned people.

My skin feels clean, but not squeaky clean, after using the cleanser, although it takes me a while to foam it. It lathers well but doesn't foam a lot from my experience. If I have a pimple, this cleanser will help diminishing it in several days. In the fall, the cleanser feels okay after using, but in the winter, my dry areas (my cheeks) can turn very dry after using the cleanser, so I have to reach for a moisturizer. With a decent price, sold at a drugstore, by a line that focuses on oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin, the gel cleanser does it job.",
