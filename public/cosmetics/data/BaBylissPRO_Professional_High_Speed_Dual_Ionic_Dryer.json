        "comments": "After using this hair dryer for a few weeks here is what I think.\nFirst of all, it is  beautiful! I love the color, size and design. It is small and lightweight compared to my old one. It comes with 4 diferentes attachments to cater to everyone's hair texture and style choices (including a diffuser). It is also quiet and very powerful.   The cool shot works very good and the buttons are very easy to\nuse. One of the buttons activate and deactivate ions for hair stylists professional treatments. It also states it uses double ions when on to dry the hair faster and make  it less frizzy. After using it 4 times I don't find that my hair dries much faster or gets less frizzy. In fact, if I use the ions button I find it makes my hair dryer ( not sure if it's because I have highlights and textured hair). I also have to point out I am using it on the medium heat option as my hair is fine. The other thing I dislike about it, (and to me it is very important) is that it doesn't have silicone or any type of bumpers to preven it from sliding when in use. (See video attached). This means you will have to turn it off every single time you put it down. The solution I found was to put a silicone mat I use to clean my brushes under it to present it from sliding around. None of this is a deal\nbreaker for me as it is less heavy than my older one but, I wanted to give my honest opinion. In the future, I would love to see bumpers on it. I am happy to have been able to try and to continue to use this hair dryer.",
