I'm sure my skin conditions are symptoms of my autoimmune conditions because I also get hormonal acne that's almost impossible to treat topically.      My usual skincare products are around 3x the price than this, and I hadn't even heard of this brand, let alone considered trying it before a friend recommended it to me. And honestly, despite the good ingredient list, I really wasn't expecting anything when I first tried it. But shockingly, I loved everything I got.      I started out applying this as one of the last steps in my routine before bed, and I was amazed at how this lightweight moisturizer was able to keep my skin supple throughout the night. But don't get me wrong, I wouldn't consider this product an occlusive at all. it's more hydrating than moisturizing.      I grab for now during the day now as well. I actually prefer it more for daytime use. Currently, summer's just beginning and the weather in my area is already a sweltering, humid 95 degrees. I love applying this in the morning because it has such a refreshing, cooling, silky, gel-like formula that doesn't pill, feel heavy under or sweats your makeup off, or cause any extra oiliness throughout the day. It feels even better kept in the fridge!     For reference, the formula/ texture/ results of this moisturizer is very comparable to Purito's Sea Buckthorn Vital 70 Cream and their Deep Sea Pure Water Cream.      This's great for those who have combination or oilier skin types and want hydration without feeling weighed down. However, if you have broken skin or a compromised/ damaged skin barrier, like from eczema or something, this may sting a little when first applied. I mean for the price point, it's amazing!",
