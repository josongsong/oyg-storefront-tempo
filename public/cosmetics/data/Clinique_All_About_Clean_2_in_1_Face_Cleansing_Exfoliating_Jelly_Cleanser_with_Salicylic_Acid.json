I have struggled to find a really great cleanser for my skin to alleviate the breakouts and really take away the blackheads which lead to breakouts.  I am still under the care of a derm but treatment has not been perfect.  I tried this product with much doubt.  Boy was I wrong!! This takes awake the blackheads (I following cleansing with the Clinique Clarifying lotion) and makes my skin so much clearer and youthful looking.  I get impacted blackheads that are awful and the Covid masks make it worse (despite changing everyday), but this cleanser takes care of everything. I have been using it twice a day, but will caution that you may have to go to one of the other Clinique cleansers as twice a day may be a bit harsh for sensitive skin.  I used Clinique in college and moved away from it for some reason.  Glad I am back.",

It is banned in many countries and still \"up for discussion\" in the USA as an additive in cosmetics. There are scientific abstracts which show in numerous studies that this chemically produced additive can cause potential reactions. (Ingesting it is a whole other issue) Clinique, you are the go to, the leader in safe, pure skincare and cosmetics. It would be fabulous if your engineers could revisit ingredient lists and remove harsh chemicals and overlooked allergens. (Lavender, chamomile, almond, walnut, shea, moringa, marula, and argan are all high on the list of supposed \"great for your skin\" allergens) \nPlease always remain as clean, safe, and pure as you are!!\nPS Calyx has been my \"go to\" fragrance for over 20 years whenever I know I will be outdoors with a lot of mosquitoes! Especially when I'm golfing! Bugs HATE green scents! Calyx not only smells fantastic, it helps keep those pesky buggers away! Bravo! (Could you please add powder to the Calyx line?)",
