I've been loving the Kenra Platinum Luxe One Leave-in as my leave-in conditioner and main heat protectant, but this weekend I decided to try the Platinum Pearl Detangler in its place.  I saw a lot of reviews here about people not liking the smell, and perhaps that's more of an issue when you apply it to wet hair and leave it to air dry, but I found the scent to be  tolerable and it was barely noticeable after I blow dried my hair.  I used a generous amount on wet hair and then followed with a little bit of Kenra Blow-Dry Spray heat protectant, as I always do when doing my silk press.  The Pearl product left my hair super shiny and silky and soft after my blow dry and flat iron was complete.  I didn't use any other products as leave-ins or heat protectants than this and the blow-dry spray.  The only other product that gives me this good of a result with the silk press is the other one I mentioned  - the Luxe One leave-in which has tiny bits of gold in it.  From now own, I will just alternate between the pearl and the gold when doing my silk presses.  I love many Kenra products, but not all of them equally, so I wouldn't bother to write a rave review of this if I wasn't truly impressed.  100% satisfaction for this product in a silk press situation!",

        "comments": "I was very excited about this product from\nThe positive reviews I had read, but the first time I used it, I could not comb my hair out? It created tangles vs detangling. I thought it would maybe dry nice after, but my hair was harder to dry, remained tangly and it felt dry and straw-like when fully dry which is never does normally. I thought maybe it was a fluke, so I tried it again about a week later and the exact same thing happened to the point that I had to braid my hair for the day instead of even wearing it down because it was so unmanageable. I love their other products but I'm\nnot quite sure what happened with this one for my hair.",
