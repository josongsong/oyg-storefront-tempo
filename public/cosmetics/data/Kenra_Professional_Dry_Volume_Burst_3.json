Much better than the Living Proof product and cheaper as well. I have shoulder length very dark brunette fine hair and it leaves no residue at all. I just hope they keep this around! Along with their award winning hairspray, this combo makes your hair look amazing!!!",

After using the spray I didn't notice any sort of difference nor did it last in my hair long. I thought this would be a perfect addition when using dry shampoo and It may have helped a tiny bit, but not enough to try again.",
