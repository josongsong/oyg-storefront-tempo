I picked this up along with several other dermalogica products and have been using them for 4 months. I wanted to use it for a while before reviewing. I wanted just a daily toner and picked this up to try out. I am not a fan of the spray component, its a little aggressive. Would much rather prefer a fine mist instead. It smells a bit like windex to me. I don't see a noticable difference after using this. So the value for the cost is not worth it to me. It's just an average toner.",

This toner makes my skin so ultra smooth and keeps my skin super soft and healthy....I am 29 and have dealt with skin senstitivity and breakouts since high school (age 16), and my skin has actually worsened over the years from life and stress;) But I began using Demalogica in Frebruary of 2011 and its now April and my skin is Flawless!!!! I will never go back to any skin care regimen and trust me, I have tried E-VE-RY single skin care product out there, including the \"all popular acne systems\"... I highly recommmend Dermalogica to every woman out there...skin problems or not....Get in touch with a skin care specialist IMMEDIATELY and have them map your skin, so they can tell you what kit to start out with and watch your beautiful skin unfold....Im also African American and suffered from the hyperpigmentation marks (dark spots over my cheek areas) and I am a butter pecan complexion....Dermalogica is fading away those marks with each cleanse morning and night...Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful!!! In addition to the toner, I use the Special Cleansing gel. Daily Microfoliant, and Active Moist Moisturizer....okay I've said enough for now;) I'M SPEECHLESS...xoxoxoxoxo's",
