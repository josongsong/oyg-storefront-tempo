        "comments": "I've had this product for over three months now. Because it is very sticky, it works like a \"lock\" for the spray button, causing the product to spray more as a direct stream rather than a mist. After a few sprays, it loosens up and becomes easier to use.\n\nI primarily use it to create waves in my hair or to straighten it. It does an excellent job of smoothing and holding a wave; however, it can make my hair feel crunchy. I have to brush my hair directly after spraying, while it's still wet, to avoid it sticking together in large clumps.\n\nToday, after being out, I went to brush my hair and discovered a huge knot. It felt sticky with a gummy-like texture, and it was difficult to remove—I had to use some oil to get it out. The only explanation I have is that this product was the cause, and I didn't brush it out quickly enough after spraying.\n\nAs other comments have noted, it is very similar to a firm-hold hairspray. Do I love it? No. Do I hate it? No. Am I going to buy it again? Not before I try something else.",

        "comments": "I bought this after seeing it on a list of best heat protectants and was so disappointed after 1 use that I thought I had to be the issue. But after multiple uses I can say it didnt get better it actually stopped working. \n\nThe spray is incredibly sticky. It sticks to everything - your hands, your counter, your mirror and even the inside of the pump. Because it was sticky inside the pump it was incredibly hard to get the spray out - I would have to use 2 hands to spray which was super inconvenient while styling and ultimately lead to uneven dsitribution. When sprayed it made my hair sticky and crunchy as well. Adding heat ultimately got rid of the crunchiness but i was very nervous at first. I tried to use this a few times but hated it so much that I ultimately stopped styling my hair. A few months later I tried to use it again - and the residue inside was so sticky it had sealed the pump closed and made it unusable. Probably used 1/4 of the bottle and hated every second of it. The only pro is that when styled my hair looked fine - so it works if you can actually use it.",

Also they were leaking when I received them so lost some product. \n\nIt is sticky and we will see overtime if it's a good heat protectant but it was recommended by my hair stylist for styling dry hair. It is like a hair spray but I like that it helps hold the style",

I keep a bottle 70% alcohol with me at work to spray on the nossil to get it to spray out evenly. I will sometimes use water as well.

I also used it to blow dry then straighten my wavy hair, and I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly it straightened out! Not to mention the fabulous volume it gave me which I don't normally have when I straighten my hair. To top it all off, it smells so good, and I am very picky with smells! This product makes me want to try more Kenra products ASAP!",

It was suggested to me by a sales associate when I went in to buy my regular catwalk iron guard. This product took my normally 1.5 hour straightening routine into 3 hours because after spraying each section I had to wait for the product to dry and also brush it through my hair because the hold was so firm.\nThe time was the biggest issue for me. As far as results, my hair came out great, it was light weight & shiny. However since I'm aware of a product that does this in half the time, I won't be repurchasing...in fact, I may try to return it.",
