It balances things out after a couple weeks of using religiously, and only takes 4-5 drops to cover an entire face. If anyone is confused about how to apply serums…start with 4-5 drops in your fingertips, rub them together (fingertips only) for just a couple seconds, then begin tapping your fingertips all over your face randomly. This evenly distributes the product before rubbing it in all over. Afterward, go ahead and press it in gently, with the palms of your clean hands. \nI have tried many brands of rosehip seed oil, and this one absorbs the best without looking or feeling heavy like some others can (as long as it's applied properly). The Baukucha oil blends by Good Molecule are nice also, but did not show results like this pure rosehip seed version for my personal skin.\nI have dark / medium 32yo skin depending on the season, and this is incredible for keeping any dark spots evened out, or diminished all together; no breakouts from using this…ever. \nI use a Niacinamide serum underneath, and a rosewater toner to finish. Keeps my skin glowing, bouncy, and hydrated all year round. Can't live without the Rosehip seed serum or Niacinamide from Good Molecules.",

Since the first day this product had a fishy smell (exactly like fish oil) and I simply shrugged it off. I continued using it on my hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes with a decieving impression that was inspiring hair growth, which it is supposed to do because of its antioxidants and vitamins. This morning I got utterly fed up with the scent and looked up why it smelled so bad. The answer I got was if your rosehip oil smells like fish then it has gone rancid, and that it is supposed to have a mild earthy or nutty scent. I am very angry and upset. I don't have that much money to spend on beauty supplies, and deeply regret my decision to spend any money on this product. I have learned my lesson to not purchase any more of Good Molecule's products for the fear of getting another spoiled, bacteria-infested item.",
