Buxom has the best color range with comfortable, cool tingling and are long lasting. Plus, the price is worth it compared to the other brands! Buxom is a little sticky, but I LOVE that. I cant stand runny glosses that end up mostly in my mouth. They wear super flattering and I hope they never change the formula because I would be truly devastated. Long live Buxom glosses 🩷💋",

        "comments": "At the age of 38 my lips are starting to wrinkle. This has caused most of my lip products to spread onto the outside of my lip line. So I just changed to liquid lipsticks. What I have found is that liquid lipsticks make my lips super dry. I recently tried one of these lip glosses and fell in love. The color white Russian can go over any liquid lip without changing the color and adding moisture and minty feel. I thought White Russian would be that nude light color but it ended up functioning well over any other bright lip color. However the lavender shade is a very beautiful nude color and not purple at all. Overall I love the product because I can use it as a top coat for my liquid lipsticks or as a moisturizing gloss.",

        "comments": "I was excited to get this on sale but was totally disappointed. I got Kir Royale, and I was expecting a full color lip gloss that was like The Gabby polish just without the glitter. What I got was this sheer gloss that was only a fraction of the color it was supposed to be. \n\nThe gloss itself is very thin for a buxom gloss, but still has that lovely buxom tingle that I love. When I applied the gloss it went on smooth like I expected, but when I looked closer, all the color had seeped into the fine lines on my lips (esp along the edge) and it kind of looked awful. I thought maybe it's because I applied too thin of a layer, so I applied another layer and all that did was accentuate the lines even more. \n\nMaybe I got a defective one or an old one, but this is not a good product. When someone says lip cream, I expect a full color, liquid lipstick type of color, not a sheer gloss with color in it. Maybe my expectations are too high, but come on buxom, this is your same old gloss that's not mixed properly or doesn't have the correct amount of color added to it. With Gabby and Brandi, I never had the color seep directly into my fine lines and make me look older or like I don't know how to apply lip products. It literally looks like a clear gloss on my lips with this feathered crackled look of color. \n\nI'm going to try it again later and see if it gets any better, if not then I'm gonna try another color or just return it. Good luck to those who bought this, I hope my experience isn't your own. \n\nI'm attaching 2 pictures of a swatch on my hand to show you what happened, but the camera kind of blurs the extent of the color seeping into the lines because of the glossiness, and the color is slightly darker than in the pics (natural sunlight and all).",
