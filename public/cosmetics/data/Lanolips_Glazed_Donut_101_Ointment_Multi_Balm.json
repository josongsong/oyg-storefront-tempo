Most lip balms have done little to help, but applying this once a day before bed keeps my lips smooth and soft throughout the day. I also keep it on hand throughout the day because I enjoy the feeling of it and the fun scents (glazed donut is my favorite right now because it is a sweet and cozy scent!). It isn't overly sticky, which is important to me since I have long hair and it gets stuck on my lips if I wear anything too sticky.",

        "comments": "This is a miracle lip balm. My lips were in rough shape when I was dehydrated, and got windburned lips from being in the middle of Wisconsin winter. My lips felt so nice when I applied this. By the next morning I noticed a significant difference in my lips. I truly could not beliefe it. I don't notice any difference on the skin, other than your skin is sticky, so I'm not sure what else to use it for other than lip balm. You don't need a lot, and it works best when you apply it with your finger. It's thick at first (main reason you don't need a lot) but, as it warms up and you run your finger back and forth a little bit, or just rub your lips together for a little bit, it thins out. So I guess you could say there's sort of a learning curve with it, but it is SO worth it! It has a shiny finish (wet/gloss shiny not shimmer shiny). The scent is fairly noticable and slightly tastes how it smells, which is artificial maple syrup. I personally love the scent, so I will definitely repurchase. Highly recommend, if you like that artificial maple syrup scent, though, as it does tend to linger for a good bit.",

        "comments": "This is a miracle lip balm. My lips were in rough shape when I was dehydrated, and got windburned lips from being in the middle of Wisconsin winter. My lips felt so nice when I applied this. By the next morning I noticed a significant difference in my lips. I truly could not beliefe it. I don't notice any difference on the skin, other than your skin is sticky, so I'm not sure what else to use it for other than lip balm. You don't need a lot, and it works best when you apply it with your finger. It's thick at first (main reason you don't need a lot) but, as it warms up and you run your finger back and forth a little bit, or just rub your lips together for a little bit, it thins out. So I guess you could say there's sort of a learning curve with it, but it is SO worth it! It has a shiny finish (wet/gloss shiny not shimmer shiny). The scent is fairly noticable and slightly tastes how it smells, which is artificial maple syrup. I personally love the scent, so I will definitely repurchase. Highly recommend, if you like that artificial maple syrup scent, though, as it does tend to linger for a good bit.",

        "comments": "I bought this after hearing great things & I so badly wanted to love it. I love a thicker gloss before bed to moisturize my lips overnight, but this just wasnt it unfortunately. I wore it out & the product turned WHITE on my lips. I thought maybe it interacted with something I wasnt sure. I tried it again later that night directly following my shower / skin care and it again after wearing it for 5-10 minutes gave a super white tint to my lips. I didnt mind the smell, but I do agree it was very heavy on the maple.  Sadly, will be returning this product.",
