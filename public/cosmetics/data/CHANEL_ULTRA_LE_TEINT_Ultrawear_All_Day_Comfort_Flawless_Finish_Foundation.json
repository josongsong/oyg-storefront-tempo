One thing I really love about this product is that its lightweight qualities allow either a medium or full coverage look that is perfectly & easily buildable to your liking. It spreads on the skin easily as well and does not dry or set in too quickly. It is my favorite of all foundations by far!!!!!",

Have tried many over the years and as I have aged I have had to become pickier in what I'm using. \n\nThis foundation is excellent for women who ate experiencing wrinkles, oiliness, uneven skin, etc. I have some wrinkles, extreme oily skin, break outs, and skin disorders. This covers everything and stays perfectly in place all day! It does NOT settle in wrinkles! It is buildable! Easy to apply! \n\nThrowing out my MAC and Clinique and keeping Chanel! \n\nOnly wish were they had paler not goldeny shades, since winter ive gotten whiter and my color no longer matches and doesn't come in a lighter shade.\n\nIf you're on the fence you will be really happy with this!!",

        "comments": "I ordered this foundation after a girl in my dance class recommended it. It looked so beautiful and flawless on her skin, and she said it was long wearing, which I like in a foundation. I have normal skin, and I do get shiny in my T-zone, which is why I look for foundations with mattifying properties. I religiously used Estee Lauder's Double Wear, but sometimes it felt too heavy on my skin. I have tried a variety of foundations, both drugstore and high-end, but I have yet to find anything that stayed in place on my skin the way it did. I think this Chanel foundation is a contender! I was not sure about the shade since I ordered online, but it's a pretty close match. I have broken blood vessels in one cheek that I prefer to cover, and I thought this foundation did so beautifully. It was also had a buildible coverage that did not cake up. I liked the finish of the foundation, so I opted to not set it with powder. It looked fresh and beautiful, even hours later! The one thing I abhor about this foundation is the fragrance. Why is that in there? I don't understand the purpose and could honestly do without it. I get migraines regularly and some scents are triggering. I could see this one being one that might trigger a migraine; however, I did notice the scent faded pretty rapidly in my opinion. It's not a deal breaker because of how gorgeous the foundation wore on my skin, but I would not be upset if they removed the fragrance altogether! Definitely worth the extra cash if you feel like splurging on a foundation, but if I found anything cheaper that was comparable, I would probably go with that option over this pricey formula.",

        "comments": "even with a good primer this slid off my face in 2 hours. I will say it initially went on like a dream- good coverage & ultra smooth finish, i had high hopes i had finally found my HG. However, it broke apart and became an oily mess. I really expected more from this at this price. My skin is T zone oily.\nSo far Estee Lauder double wear has been the best and my go to.  it does look a bit cakey if applied to heavily though and emphasizes lines and wrinkles.",
