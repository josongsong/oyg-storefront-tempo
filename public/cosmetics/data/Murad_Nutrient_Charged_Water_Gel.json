Otherwise, I end up with like a light film everywhere. I don't understand it because I do feel like it absorbs, and it's not because I don't exfoliate. It's only this product that does it, which sucks because I have oily/combo skin and sometimes get cystic acne, and this moisturizer is the only one that doesn't break me out and doesn't leave me greasy. I'd rather deal with the flaking than breaking out, so I keep getting it!",

It's not too light that it gives too little moisture and it's more gel than cream so not too heavy either. There is a light floral fragrance to the cream, too. Again, the level of moisture feels right for my skin, but what I don't love about this is it pills. I only use it at night because there's no use trying to put make-up over it. I often wake up in the mornings with tiny little gel clumps on my face, even with very light application. For the price, it doesn't feel worth it for me not to be able to use it both night and day and to literally have it come off my face.",

As someone who regularly exfoliates, I expected this to drink into my skin, but it just sat. When dry (I usually wait 10 mins before applying makeup) it flakes off when I start to put on my foundation. So, I tried an option where I washed my face, patted dry, then just put this on with no other Murad serums beforehand. Still dry/tight and flakes off. I have combination skin and wanted something lightweight and stuck with the Murad brand of products but this was a no.",

I use this as my third step in my skin care regimen after using the Murad hydro dynamic eye cream and it works fabulous together I would not change this for anything! I just turned 54 and my skin has very few wrinkles or sagging and I attribute that to the Murad products I have been using consistently and religiously! I have are there Murad products that also are the best I've ever used including their spot acne treatment because even at my age you occasionally get a blemish and this gets rid of it without the flaking and drying of other acne treatments! Dr. Murad was a genius of skin care! I just literally cannot say enough about this product or any Murad product! If you're on the fence about trying this it is so worth the price a little goes a long way so don't use a lot at first go easy with it and find your perfect amount from there. One 1.7 ounce jar lasts me quite a while and I use it twice a day regularly and religiously! it goes great under makeup and makes Foundation look so much smoother sometimes I don't even use a primer because my skin looks so nice I often don't even go without any foundation just this moisturizer! I realize this is a very long review I generally don't leave many reviews but I feel very strongly about this product it is amazing just amazing! It is well worth the money and I assure you, you will be more than pleased with your purchase!!",

        "comments": "I had never tried a water-gel before, but after reading these reviews I was sold! My skin is normal/combo. The initial application was so nice. I don't have sensitive skin so I didn't mind that this product has fragrance. \n\nI started noticing some negative changes to my skin immediately, including tightness in my skin toward the evening times which had never happened before. It's important to note that I did not change any other aspect of my skincare routine. My skin has never been extremely dry or flaky but I realized there was a problem when I wore the CC cream I've used for +2 years (IT cosmetics CC cream) and saw actual flakiness! With quarantine, I only wear makeup once a week so I was shocked to see my skin flake.\n\nI used this product twice a day, every day for three weeks. I finally decided to exchange it for the First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream which has been working fabulously!\n\nI'm giving this two stars because it's important to note that I live in a dry climate which might be a contributing factor to this products inificieny towards my skin.",
