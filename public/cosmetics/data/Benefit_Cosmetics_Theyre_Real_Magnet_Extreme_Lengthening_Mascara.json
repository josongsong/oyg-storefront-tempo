        "comments": "Benefit They're Real! Magnet Extreme Lengthening Mascara is different than any other mascara out there. It has a magnetically charged core in the brush, and the ingredients in the formula are attracted to the brush. This is science, people. The opening is smaller than it needs to be so that the brush is covered in just the right amount of product. No more having to wipe excess product off your mascara wand! This mascara took 4 years to develop and when I learned that Benefit had patented their magnetic technology I had very high expectations and let me tell you, Benefit They're Real! Magnet Extreme Lengthening Mascara did not disappoint in any way.\nI first noticed the creatively located image of a magnet on the top of the wand, on a gorgeous silver tube. The shade is called \"Supercharged Black\" which is a fun play on the magnet theme going on here.\nAfter I applied my eyeliner, shadow, my face makeup and combed my eyelashes, I was more than ready to try this mascara out. I wanted to see how it could benefit the look of my lashes. Wow! The bristles on here are placed perfectly, and it really did grasp every single lash very quickly. You can actually see the magnetic technology working! It usually takes me about 8 minutes to apply mascara, but while using Benefit They're Real! Magnet Extreme Length Mascara it took me half the time! (Yes, I really did use a timer to see how long it takes/took to apply mascara.) Usually I have a very difficult time applying mascara to my bottom lashes and I usually get the formula on my skin, but that did not happen with this mascara. It immediately picked up every tiny little lash and coated them just perfectly. My lashes look so pretty, a very flirty fanned out look, and definitely longer! The only thing this mascara doesn't do is make lashes look a lot thicker, but I don't think this mascara was created with that in mind. I believe their focus was on creating a very lengthening mascara that grabs each lash quickly and easily and they perfected that goal. No wonder they put a patent on it! I am charmed with this mascara in every way.\nThis is the mascara of the future.\nI want to say thank you to Benefit cosmetics and thank you to Influenster for sending me this incredible mascara in return for my 100% honest review of my experience with it.",

        "comments": "Mascara is such a subjective product; different people have different lashes and lids and desire different effects. For that reason, I can't outright pan this mascara, but I was really disappointed that the formula didn't give me the results I look for. \n\nI have dark, straight lashes of varying lengths and density, fairly dry lids, and I go for a \"My Face But Better\" look when doing my makeup. My favorite mascaras tend to be 1) long-wearing tubing formulas that give my lashes a boost without being obvious 2) non-clumping, non-flaking formulas I can swipe on and forget about for the rest of the day, and 3) easy to remove with my regular micellar water at the end of the day.  \n\n2 of my HG mascaras—They're Real Tinted Primer and They're Real in shade Mink Brown—are not only made by Benefit but *part of this mascara line*. I was really excited about this VoxBox, but They're Real MAGNET just missed the mark for me. \n\nI'm including photos for comparison, but the first thing I noticed was the wand. They're Real/Primer and even Roller Lash have thin, very flexible wands; however, the MAGNET wand is stiff and much thicker. You can tell it is meant to grab more product, and it does. The first time I used MAGNET, the product application was so thick and goopy I had to go back through my lashes with a clean wand to separate my lashes. Bit of a hassle, but they looked nice when I'd finished. A few hours later, I had to remove one of my contacts because something was in my eye: the culprit ended up being 2 big flecks of mascara :( I wrote it off as user error, and decided to scrape off the excess on the tube before use next time to avoid a repeat. I also made a note that the mascara didn't come off with Bioderma and my second cleanse that first evening. \n\nThe second time I wore MAGNET, I scraped off the excess on the tube and applied carefully. The formula feels very thick, almost like dried out Roller Lash. I think this could give a volumizing effect, but it made my uneven length lashes clump together again. I separated them out with a lash tool but felt like I had spider-leg lashes. I was sweeping fallout from my undereyes all day but still had a hard time removing the mascara. If you oil-cleanse regularly, removal shouldn't be a problem (I just didn't have an oil or biphasic on hand and had to hunt one down). \n\nAs with all mascaras, I'd recommend purchasing in travel size first to see if this works for you before committing to the full size. Benefit is awesome about making sample/travel sizes available and they last for several months with daily use. #VoxBox #Benefit #TheyreRealMAGNET #mascara",
