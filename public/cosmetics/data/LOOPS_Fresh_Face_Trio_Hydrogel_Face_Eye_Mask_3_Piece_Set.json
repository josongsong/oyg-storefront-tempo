I wasn't expecting a huge difference, but wow — these little patches actually work. The moment I put them on, they feel super cooling and refreshing, like an instant wake-up call for my eyes.\n\nWhat I love most is how they help with puffiness and those stubborn dark circles. I tend to look pretty tired in the mornings, but after using these, my under-eye area looks much more awake and brighter. They're gentle too — I have sensitive skin and I haven't had any irritation at all. Just smooth, hydrated skin.",
