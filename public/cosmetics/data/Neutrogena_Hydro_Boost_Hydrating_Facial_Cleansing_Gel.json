        "comments": "TLDR: NO, BAD AND HARMFUL, GET ANYTHING ELSE, I am now confident neutragena products are all worthless\n\nFirst of all: neutragena, you have failed me time and again with products that boast claims that are either impossible to achieve with the actual ingredients or have the complete opposite effect. I have been burned by choosing to trust advancing forumulations from this brand so many times. Y'all should be ashamed of yourselves for selling this to people, a product that is practically heavily scented dish soap. It is absolutely ridiculous to put the word hydrating on this product and tell people it is safe to put on your face. Shame on you! Enjoy never getting my money again & seeing the impact of your awful formulations on your shrinking sales charts from everyone else realizing they can literally get almost any other facial cleanser on the market and have a better experience. Want to listen to my feedback? Develop better formulas and listen to the scientists in your lab (god I hope there are scientists) when they say one is awful \n \nAfter a few uses on my face I realized this cleanser is incredibly stripping. It left me with that alarming \"squeaky clean\" noise on both face and body skin. After max 4 uses this caused my face to peel and a giant wound to open after continued use past that. And I only continued using because this was my only option, at this point I might throw it away.\n\nI would never repurchase this cleanser, even for body acne. I would highly recommend researching ingredients of your cleanser, even just running through an AI asking if any ingredients may be harmful to you. Labmuffinbeautyscience (idk if I got that 100% right) was very helpful and has alternative suggestions that worked for me.",

I did not use it around my eyes, not sure about waterproof mascara.",

I have combination skin and I was just looking for a good hydrating cleanser to use as we move into the colder months - thinking this would help hence the name. Upon day 2 to 3 of use my face began to break out horribly! I attributed this to the \"purge\" phase, and continued use. This was the WORST mistake I could've made because it has only gotten so so much worse! I'm devastated. I will also add that there is really nothing hydrating about the product either. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I do know that this product falls way below even the most basic cheap cleansers. I believe they really bombed on this one. I've never had a product be so opposite of it's uses and claims - to the point that it reversed the quality of my skin and actually caused harm.",

After rinsing, my face was free of the day's grime and it didn't feel stripped at all. For being so gentle, I didn't believe that it would remove a full face of makeup. Boy, was I wrong, it removed foundation, brow gel, eyeshadow, liquid eyeliner, 3 coats of mascara, highlight, bronzer, and blush. I wear contacts and it has never irritated or burned my eyes. I will definitely put this on the list for the future. \r\n\r\nI received this product through PINCHme for free in exchange for an honest review.",
