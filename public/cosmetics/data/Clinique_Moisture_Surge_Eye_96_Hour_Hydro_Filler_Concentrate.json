It is also very sticky on the skin for an hour. \nThe pump gets clogged too easy with the small pilled droplets in it. Nothing will come out, so have to pump it multiple times then way too much comes out and it's wasted because you cannot put any back. \nVery disappointing as this is too expensive for the terrible packaging. Would be better in a squeeze tube or something you can put it back into if you get too much out.",

This product does an excellent job at keeping the skin around my eyes hydrated, protected, and just looking better overall. If I skip a day or two I really notice. The only drawback is that the packaging is a real pain to deal with. The dispenser does not want to dispense, and when it does, random amounts of product come out. I'm on my 4th or 5th tube and they are all the same way (this tells you how good the product is, that I've stuck with it for this long). I store the tube upside down and it works well most of the time. I might try some other products soon because I'm so tired of struggling with the dispenser.",

Thanks to the store manager she taught me how to place the pea size amount on my finger, and gently rub the product to \"break the capsules\" required to get the eye gel to work with the full effects, this is important, I tried it anf fell in love with it, I purchased and started using it immediately and my eyes were brighter, you can feel it working like a gentle tightening, and my favorite part, it is totally non irritating, I gently put under my eyes near the corners, and a bit on the lids, the next morning I felt my skin around my eyes and the moistureizing effect is huge! I still use my Clinique All About Eyes for puffiness and use this a couple times a week as it lasts so long on your skin, even after that morning face wash they are still hydrated, one pump gives that pea sized amount so the product goes a long way, and will last a long time. The texture of this eye gel is unbelievable it's so silky and yet you almost feel the aloe butter working around your eye area. I would recommend for everyone especially for women who don't sleep well, (like myself) and for anyone looking to brighten the eye area especially under eye makeup it truly is the only eye gel I've actually felt and see it working! Thank you Clinique for an excellent product and another favorite moisture surge product, nothing compares!😍😊",

So Clinique is not cruelty-free. My second point of issue is cost. If this eye cream was super hydrating and long-lasting, cost wouldn't concern me but I think this is one of the worst eye creams I've tried all year and at the highest price point at that. I personally don't like the bursting beads in beauty products but the beads aside, the formula of this is thin, slippery, and doesn't feel like it absorbs well. I tried with and without product under this eye gel but neither approach seems to help it absorb. I've tried water gels that absorb into the skin well and hold moisture all day but didn't have the same experience with this product. If you like a thin eye gel, this might be a good fit, but if you're a cream hydrator fan, keep looking!",
