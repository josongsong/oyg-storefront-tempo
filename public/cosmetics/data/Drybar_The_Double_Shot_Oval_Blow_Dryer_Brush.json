I was the first one to use it, and I used it on wet hair and the drying time was fine. However, the end result was not good. It made my hair feel as if it were doll hair in the regards of it being tingly. I don't believe this unit is hard enough to leave the (Hair) looking smooth and polished. My daughter used it a couple days later and had the same if not worse results than I did. Sadly, we will be returning this product.",

I've tried MULTIPLE dryer brushes (one actually caught fire because it just couldn't handle this thick mane of mine) and non of them lasted long. I was told about the drybar brand and to try the double shot dryer. So I figured if it works, I don't mind spending the money. I love it, but my only issue is with having thick hair the bristles don't last long with these kinds of dryers. The dryer works great after having it just over a yr, but unfortunately the bristles are falling off and/or are burned which sucks since this isn't a cheap product. I wish this one came with changeable brush heads so I can toss the beat up one. Other than that, this dryer is great, just sad that I may have to look for other options",
