I got sick of constantly spending money on those pencils that always break,  are difficult to apply,  and just don't have a good amount of pigment in them.   Problem solved with this product!  This stuff is highly pigmented and I can already tell it's going to last me a very long time.   A little bit goes a very long way.  I apply it with an Anastasia angled brush and it literally stays on all day.   No smudging or fading.   I love this product and I highly recommend it... especially if you are tired of constantly buying those eyebrow pencils that always break.",

After a few hours you can see my pores have absorbed the product and you can see black dots underneath my brows. I have black hair and olive skin so i bought both ebony and dark brown. I have tried them alone and even blended. Same result. So disappointed as soooo many swear by this and i really wanted to love it.",
