        "comments": "I received a free bottle of this as a gift with my order last year. After a couple wears, I went on and bought another bottle. It wasnt until my 3rd bottle that I read all the claims. The claims are spot on! I kept telling people about this foundation. Because when it survives a summer in Florida without any issues, you tell everyone you know. I would tell people that I feel like I rarely get oily, but its also not drying. (I have normal to combo skin depending on the time of year). I could never truly describe what type of foundation this was until I came and read the claims. The ONLY con is the bottle itself and lack of a pump. I dont use this like a moisturizer and use my hands (weirds me out). So when pouring product on the back of my hand, its hard to control how much comes out. Other than that- I LOVE this foundation. Please dont ever discontinue!",

        "comments": "I tried this foundation years ago when it first released. I liked it well enough, used it up, but never repurchased at that time. I've been on a \"skin tint\" kick for a while now, but was looking for something with more coverage for an event this summer, and decided to try this again. So glad I did! This applies and blends easily, settles down to a nice satin finish (but can be manipulated with primer - dewy primer gives more glow, matte primer takes the satin finish down). I have dry skin and it didn't cling or emphasize dryness. I also have mature skin (48) and this looked nice on all my areas of fine lines. It lasts well for a normal day. No irritation or breakouts. \n\nThe big CON: the shades run dark and a bit cool toned. I don't mind the undertones since I lean cooler complexion, but the shade Ivory is about two shades darker than other brands' ivory shade. I've been using this quite a bit all summer, but will likely have to set it aside for winter as the shade is too dark.",

When at Ulta the other day, another woman told me she experienced the same with her new bottle and has moved to another brand of foundation. I did notice that my old bottle said \"Made in the US\" and now the new ones say \"Made in Canada\".\n\nI am sad that I can no longer use Superbalanced and now have to change brands. Clinique- if you did change an ingredient or formula, please bring back the old version.\n\nSad to go!",
