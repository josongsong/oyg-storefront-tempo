The Ulta makeup artist suggested Mull It Over to me based on my inspiration, and I love it! No, it's not coral, BUT it is a gorgeous light terra cota that works for my skin color. It's now my go-to for daily wear. Love!",

The soft blurring effect is so forgiving if you don't have the perfect lip base- I live in a dry climate and have had lipsticks leaving me looking awful after application because of how they pool. It was so shocking to find that this formula actually leaves my lips looking alright after- many lipsticks I've tried end up drying my lips throughout the day. \n\nAbsolutely favorite formula, sultry move is my favore lipstick. If they offered some griege, or neutral gray beigey tones for the alternative and goth girls, I would buy 10 just to ensure I always had one. We've been looking for ages and if mac brought a powderkiss version, it would dominate.",

        "comments": "I have a love/hate relationship with matte lipsticks. I despise shiny lips on me, but matte lipsticks are usually really drying. This is a great in-between formula that's SO comfortable to wear. It doesn't look like I've smeared my mouth with gloss, but it doesn't suck the life out of my lips, either. The Werk Werk Werk shade is gorgeous! I've looked and looked for a red that's less intense than my favorites (Russian Red and Ruby Woo) without being pink on me. (I'm medium-fair with blonde hair and light eyes, so it might look more pink than red on a darker complexion.) This one is my new holy grail soft red. It manages to be red without being !!RED!!, if that makes any sense. I love the way that I can apply it lighter for a sheer look or heavier for more color, and it's still red no matter what. The only downside I've found is that it can smear easily, but that's how it goes if you're wearing something that's not a super matte or long-wear lipstick. The color fades a bit throughout the day, but I don't mind reapplying. If you have fine lines around your mouth, you might want to use a lip liner. The first time I used it, it feathered within a couple of hours. I use a clear liner with Powder Kiss lipsticks because I usually go for a soft-focus application instead of a sharp lined look. I've never found a liner that doesn't also work its way into the lines along with my lipstick, but clear does the job with this lipstick formula. When I discovered the Powder Kiss formula, I bought several and let my mom and sister both pick one from my haul. They love them, too.",

        "comments": "I like the concept of it, it's more silicone based so it feels very lightweight. This formula doesn't have the waxy feel of a matte lipstick but doesn't feel as oily/waxy as a satin for example. The slip it has is much more light feeling. HOWEVER, the lipstick transfers pretty easily. It transfers as much a lustre or glaze. I do enjoy that sort of soft-focus look but if you have deeper lines it doesn't make much of a difference. Another thing I'm not fond of is the pigment. It seems more like a buildable coverage. My issue with buildable is that you'll end up with the creasing aspect of color pooling into the lines and emphasizing them. I don't like that the formula varies by shade. Some crease up more than others, some aren't as pigmented as others. I think MAC ought to formulate each color to be consistent. I do quite like \"Devoted to Chili\" though, looks great for the fall! \n\nIn general I like the formula, though I feel this formula should have really utilized their nude shades, that soft focus look would look amazing with nude shades for everyday wear especially with this lightweight formula. I'd love to see Yash, Kinda Sexy, Cherish, Angel, Creme Cup, Peachstock and even faux in this formula.",
