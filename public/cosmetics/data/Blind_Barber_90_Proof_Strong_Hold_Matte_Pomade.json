I kinda wish that they would make it into a cologne for men. \n\nThe hold is very strong. It's easy to overdo with this product. But as long as you mind how much you're using, I think this is a great product to keep unruly hair in place.",

I'll usually run a dime-size amount through the roots and use a round brush and blow dryer to style. It doesn't leave my hair crunchy or too greasy, and it's easy to fix my hair throughout the day if I need to. I'm not usually a fan of fragrance, but the vanilla is very elegant and unisex. I also like that it washes out pretty easily. I would repurchase it.",

This sample size really had me excited because I finally found a product that made my hair look amazing - it had a great micro web look and really went on great! It dried really mat as well which is great for me! I couldnt wait to get a larger size! Unfortunately when I received my purchase the product was not even remotely the same. The gel leaves hair greasy and does not have the same micro web feel not does it have the same grip on my hair. Every time I go to do my hair now I really don't look forward to it - I pretty much have resorted to wearing hats. Honestly, if someone could help me out in finding something that fits what I found in the sample size above I would be so happy! Please help.",
