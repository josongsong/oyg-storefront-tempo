        "comments": "The Banilla Co Clean It Zero Green Peel Toner pad is the best toner pad I've used. I have very oily skin so toning is a necessity for me. I usually get the toner & add it to a cotton pad, but this product simplifies that process. They are presoaked & I love that it includes tweezers to help remove the pads. The actual texture is what really won me over. Most toning pads are too rough & harsh, in my opinion. These are rough enough to slightly exfoliate, but not feel scratchy. The actual formula on the pads effectively clarifies & balanced my skin. I'm having no oily issues on the days I use this product. I'm so happy I've discovered this brand. I see why the K-Beauty craze is alive & well. I'd highly recommend for oily, unbalanced skin.",

They are oversized pads (in a rather oversized jar!) which makes them much easier to use that the standard pad size. These pads are good as touch ups between face washes, esp if you have oil skin like me. It takes some of the oil off and leaves your face feeling refreshed and cleaner.",

I tried the Clean it Zero green peel toner pads and I love how it removed my waterproof eye make-up and left my skin feeling much brighter and smooth.  I have combination skin, but I tend to be more oily, especially at the end of the day.  The toner pad removed my excess oil and didn't dry out my skin.  The packaging is really well designed and includes little tongs to pick up only one toner pad at a time.  Other toner pads that I've tried in the past are hard to pick up and you end up picking up a few and putting the extras back in.  Which then causes them to dry out.  Not a problem with these toner pads.  They never dried out!  Also, after cleaning my face, I used the pads on my elbows.  I don't have really rough elbows, but what does it hurt?!  Clean ingredients and clean skin.  Best clean product I've used in awhile!  Gifted by Banila Co.",
