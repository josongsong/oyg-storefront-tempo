I'm a little bit of a review snob and never buy a product that has less than 4.5 stars, but I bought this on a whim without looking at reviews.  I'm so glad I didn't look at reviews because this product is amazing and I have bought 2 bottles so far.  I don't wear mascara often but when I do it's usually waterproof or drugstore L'Oréal.  It also works great for eyeliner and eyeshadow.  There's 0 scent which I prefer.  I put this product on a cotton ball and everything melts off super easy.  The ONLY issue I have with it is that if it gets in your eye and you're not super careful, it will cloud your vision for a few minutes.  When I use it really carefully I don't have any issues.  I've tried so many eye make up removers and this one is by far the best.  A little bit goes a long way too.  I really wouldn't let these reviews deter you..it's worth trying for yourself! You may love it, I definitely do :)",

There is no scent making this perfect for sensitive skin!\n\nI have always wanted to try a milky eye makeup remover but, I had got the chance to until this product. This eye makeup remover is so gentle yet moisturizing it leaves my skin feeling and looking better than before I used it. I wear waterproof mascara and it removes the mascara with ease and I do not lose tons of lashes like with most makeup removers. This eye makeup remover gentle dissolves the mascara leaning my lashes not feeling crispy but, moisurized.\n\nThis makeup remover has three ceramides in it that dissolve the makeup and THEY WORK!!! You then add in the hyaluronic acid to bring moisture back to your skin you get one of the most effect, gentle cleaners I have ever used!\n\nI wear contacts and I have zero issue using this while I wear my contacts which is amazing, as most things irratate them. I feel like this makeup remover has aided in my eyes looking the best they have in years and being more moisturized to help prevent or slow down aging. I also feel comfortable wearing mascara more often now because, this makeup remover takes the mascara off while sparing my eyelashes! This makeup remover is absolutely everything I could ask for!!",

After shaking the product to mix it, I found the fragrance free product was gentle on the skin and did not leave an oily residue.  I like that the compact design means that it holds just about the same ounces (4) as my favorite remover (4.2), but at a shorter footprint, which is nice for users who lack counter space or use a medicine cabinet for toiletries.  I wear several coats of mascara and found that this product struggled a bit to fully remove my make-up.  It took several attempts and a bit of work, but the product eventually did remove my mascara.",
