        "comments": "I have been very fortunate to have \"outgrown\" my hormonal acne. Whether that is from the multitude of birth control's I have been on, or just simply growing in age, I am fortunate nonetheless. With that being said, in the last few months I have been noticing increased breakouts in my cheek area, which was surprising to me as I have been one of those people that maybe gets a pimple around their cycle and just simply rinses their face with water while in the shower. I have always dealt with oily skin so I decided to try out this face wash as I didn't want anything medicated or too strong, but enough to wash the sweat and oiliness at the end of each day and hopefully mitigate my breakouts. After about a month of use, I have noticed a slight reduction in my breakouts, but nothing major. I will say this cleanser is definitely not for \"problem\" skin or severe acne, but enough for a basic cleanser. It does however leave my skin feeling a bit stripped and dry so following up with a moisturizer is definitely a must. I personally use Bubble. Overall, I'm not sure if I would buy this again but it's a decent price for the size and works well enough.",

After using this product I have not broken out SINCE (even during menstrual) and its been over two months since Ive been using it. For the price point there is a ton of product and lasts you months so youre really getting your moneys worth. I pair it with the facial moisturizer and let me tell you, the discourlation that Ive had for years is beginning to fade and my skin is BRIGHT!!! Highly recommend this brand/product.",

No bubble wrap no peanuts no crumpled paper I'm surprised the pump didn't snap off from the top of the bottle. \nAnd what a waste on your companies shipping costs for a box that was the size of a 25 gal. Storage container. Thats the size of one of those black with yellow lid boxes you probably have in your garage or basement. \n\nLucky nothing was broken. But do better. Now I have a giant box I have to tear up to fit the in my tiny CA recycling can. \n\nYes, I would recommend because prices are good and it is a well known company.",

I don't wear foundation, but I do wear sunscreen, loose powder, and tubing mascara.  This face wash works well for me if I start with a wet face, lather the product in my hands, and then apply it.  My skin is sensitive, so I just use my fingers and to loosen and massage the sunscreen and other products off, with just a bit of attention on the lash line for the mascara.  Everything rinses cleanly away, and the product seems less harsh than other foaming cleansers I've tried.",

I also like how I can use this cleanser both in the summer and winter as I can be prone to oily skin in the summer and dry skin in the winter. I also love how one bottle seems to last me a long time! Another pro is that it seems to help with my hormonal acne as well :)\n\nA huge con however is that it is true that the spring in the pump does rust. Ive only recently noticed this but it is gross nonetheless. I still love this cleanser I just buy the refils and reuse a different bottle from another cleanser I had.",

I like this a lot and have had zero pimples or zits since starting to use it. I started using this in May and it's now the end of June. I'm very impressed. I first tried this by using a sample I got at a yearly derm doc appointment.",

Half a pump is all I need to get lots of lather, especially when I use my natural sea sponge on exfolation days. It REALLY lathers well, and one bottle lasts a long time. I've been using this twice daily for two months now, and I'm only half way through the bottle. It's a great price for the quantity and quality of product you get. It doesn't dry or irritate my skin, either. I would recommend using a micellar water or makeup remover before washing your face with this, though, just to make sure you've got ALL of the makeup off, and a toner afterwards. It leaves the skin feeling very clean without feeling stripped. I don't think it would work for drier skin, though. Sensitive skinned people should be fine using this. My skin is slightly sensitive and I've had no problems with it at all. I will repurchase.",
