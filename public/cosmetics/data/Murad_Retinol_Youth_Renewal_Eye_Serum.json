        "comments": "Murad Skincare - Retinol & Resurgence Review\nAs I approach 30, I've gotten much better about an anti-aging nighttime skincare routine. This line from Murad is a good option to start entering the world of retinol. For best results, we are meant to use in combination with Retinol Youth Renewal Serum and Retinol Youth Renewal Eye Serum. This super-trio is buffered by gentle hydrating ingredients that make sure you don't get the flake or irritation that's known to come with retinol. \nThe serum for eyes specifically is designed to \"treat fine lines and wrinkles, firm skin and reduce dark circles for an overall vibrant morning face.\"\nOverall: High end, quality retinol product, very popular and admired brand. It's a nice option for a simple 3-step nighttime care kit. Light and easy to layer together, not greasy. It does get tingly on the eyes so be careful and don't over apply. \nPackaging: it is great to have the pump on the jar. The pump dispenser means you will be able to get the dose out accurately; one pump is enough for both eyes. It's also great & necessary that the container keeping the product away from light and air. \nIngredients: Overall this does not have the cleanest ingredients, very strong chemicals in here. Very potent, but not the most gentle option on the market for sensitive skin. The retinol is a newer formula, not the barebones formulas that are known for irritation. Although I still had a noticeable, flakey dry spot under my eyebrow. This is known to happen with retinol. I probably didn't apply the moisturizing step and this caused the flaking. \nFragrance ingredients aren't the best for sensitive skins. Small amounts of very volatile, synthetic environmentally toxic ingredients. Shea & other ingredients are there for antioxidants and to help moisturize. Peptide-rich red algae extract helps improve firmness and elasticity.\nCruelty free! \nResults: I have been using for about 5 weeks. I haven't seen dramatic results yet, but ingredients list leads me to be confident that I will around week 12. This product line is known to take 12 weeks or more to really see effect set in. Which is expected as retinol, essentially gentler formulas, are known to take this long to see results.",

        "comments": "I received the Retinol Youth Renewal Eye Serum in the trial kit and was really looking forward to seeing results.  After using this product for about 2 weeks, I developed white spots - almost like small pimples - around my eyes - and of course on the most delicate areas!  Not only that, it actually looked as if I developed MORE fine lines and the skin around my eye area was very dry.  I will stick to my Regenerist Retinol24 Night Eye Cream.....",
