The finish is absolutely gorgeous, especially when pairing it with Huda Beauty's Cherry loose setting powder under my eyes, my nose, above my lip, and my chin. It's necessary for me to find a good foundation and a good powder because I live in Phoenix, AZ. As soon as I step outside, the heat beats down on me. The SPF in this foundation is obviously not enough, so first I moisturize with Pond's, put a 60+ SPF sunscreen cream on, Power Grip primer, then my foundation. My foundation has never looked so good! I don't care what anyone else says, but I love the scent of the foundation. I feel so pretty and luxe when applying it and smelling it. I'm on my second bottle and I will definitely be purchasing it again as it is my new regular foundation. I only hope that maybe Dior considers adding more SPF to it, but not if it changes the current formula.",

And this formula is extremely glowy, so a litte definitely goes a Loooong way. \nI have also been mixing this foundation with lighter BB cream to create my own shade, its been great - the glow stayed on ALL DAY. In comparison, Estée Lauder is just a bit smoother and matte. \nHope this helps!",

        "comments": "I received the Dior Forever Skin Glow foundation from Influenster as a free sample for my honest review. I use the shade 1W Warm and it is the perfect for me. I am usually a NC15 in MAC, and have fair skin with a warm undertone. Dior has a good range of shades, so I think most people would be able to find their match I have normal to dry skin, which is mostly dry in the winter, so I'm always looking for foundations like this one to add extra hydration.\n\nI have tried the old formula of this foundation and it was too dry for my skin, however the skin glow version of this foundation is perfect for my dry skin. It helps to hydrate and doesn't stick to my dry patches. \n\nThe foundation can be easily buildable, depending on the look you're going for. If I am looking for a healthy, dewy look I use my beauty blender. If I am looking for a more full coverage look, I use my flat foundation brush to stipple on the product. Either way it is applied it sinks right into my skin without siting on to of my skin like some foundations. It minimizes the appearance of pores and makes my complexion look healthy and plump. \n\nI live in a Florida where it gets humid and warm even during the winter months. This foundation does stand up against the heat, even without setting with a powder! No need to reapply. The foundation could easily be worn for several hours without breaking up or melting off. Also, I really appreciate the added sunscreen to help protect my skin from the Florida UV rays. \n\nI would serenity recommend this product to friend and family. Dior did such a good job with this foundation because it makes your skin look like yours, just better. The packaging is also very luxe and minimalist looking. Sustainable package is important to me, so the bottle being made from recycled materials, and that you are able to recycle the bottle itself is an added bonus I will repurchase this foundation when I run out!",

        "comments": "*All photos are taken in the natural light and are without any editing* \n\nAhh I don't know where to begin with this one as there were a few issues. I had such high hopes and expectations for a product from such a prestige brand, but, alas. For a foundation that's supposed to be hydrating, this couldn't be more drying and matte on my skin. At first, I thought I got the wrong one. No, this is the new formula (according to many devoted users online). I think it accentuated all the imperfections of my skin. It made my skin feel tighter as the day went on, yet the coverage was not as desired. The other problem was the shade. I got a neutral cause that's what usually works for my skin that is cool-toned with bright warm freckled. The neutrals make it all look more even. However, the shade 0.5N (which seemed like it should have been light enough for my fair skin) was waaay too yellow, and oxidized into a shade that was a couple of tones darker than what I was aiming for. The oxidization with this one is intense. It became too dark and too orange for me. I don't mind the scent of this foundation, but it could do without it (it reminded me of an air freshener scent, to be honest). The last issue I had with this is removing it. My cleanser that I use for any makeup removal didn't work on this one. I had to \"wipe\" the foundation off with a cleansing pad. It's so sad to be so disappointed with the product that comes with a hefty price tag, but here we are. This one is a strong pass for me. Hoping I get to be wowed by Dior in the future, but today is not the day... at least not with this foundation.",
