I love the way you can see the bright light with a digital temperature just up to 455 Fahrenheit with a little twist easily adjustable. The curling iron will beep when your temperature is ready to use! My favorite is the 9ft professional swivel cord no more tangling or twisting. I have a medium length hair and this 1 1/4 it's a perfect size for a nice smooth curls or beach wavy look. My curls looks amazing nice and shiny all day. This is one of the best curling iron I have ever had. Great modern design!                                     \r\nHot Tools' Professional Black Gold 1-1/4\" Digital Curling Iron has an ergonomic design and efficient styling with digital controls. It's great for styling romantic, softer curls and waves and even creating tighter styles with subtle definition.\r\nFeatures \r\n* 1-1/4\" barrel size\r\n* Temperatures reach up to a professional-grade 455 degrees F for any style on any hair type.                               2-hour auto shut-off gives you peace-of-mind & universal dual voltage lets you create anywhere you travel\r\n* 9-ft. professional cord for comfortable reach & hassle-free styling",

        "comments": "In all honesty, I've never been more disappointed with a curling iron. I'm a licensed cosmetologist and have been using Hot Tools styling tools for a decade and never have I had a tool under-perform like this, sure I've broken more than one marcel iron due to excessive wear & tear, but they always did their job - the curls came out beautifully smooth and held their shape for a long time without any added product, but I can't say the same for this tool.\n\nI've tried everything, clean hair without product, hair with heat protectant, using working spray, finishing with hair spray and nothing will keep the curl in the hair for longer than 3-5 hours tops. Using smaller sections and a higher heat initially appeared to curl the hair better, but it fell out by the time I got done curling the rest. I'm not sure if the barrel is just heating unevenly, causing the hair to be unable to fully take shape, or if this iron requires an abnormally long contact time with the hair.\n\nThis is my first time using one of the newer, digital styling tools and I'm sad I bothered to try this instead of the standard gold iron that I'm familiar with (and always gives superb results). While the look of the tool is sleek, more functional (love the built-in stand that you don't have to constantly take out and tuck back in, plus a longer barrel), and modern (the digital aspect is quite nice and the orange light when it is heated up helps remind you that it's still on), the tool itself does not produce the results I expect from a Hot Tools product.",
