No matter what i tried my face inevitably ended up dry, cracked, flaky, and sensitive around my chin. I tried so many different moisturizers, getting facials, slugging, exfoliants to get the dead skin off, and nothing helped. I'm not sure when i picked this up, but within a week my skin did a complete 180. I was trying another product at the time and stopped using this for a few days to determine which was helping and i very quickly found out it was this one. I've never looked back. The only con is the packaging. The pump can be annoying to get going, and also i wish it came in a bigger size!",

I have used this above my lip, on my elbows, hands, knees, feet, and ankles.  This has made my skin feel soft , and it honestly does not hurt anymore. I absolutely LOVE this! It pumps out of the bottle easily,  I do not smell anything from it, and it's not greasy.  This is a amazing product and mind-blowing quality.",

Usually my products come in a box but this time they came packaged in a bubble mailer, which isn't the issue or a problem at all, I just noticed that was the first thing different. \nSecond thing I noticed it came from the Return Center, which maybe I never paid attention to before but that for some reason stuck out to me.\nThird, all my products came in perfect condition except for this one.  The top came off super easy as if the circle sticker seal on the right side of the bottle where the cap meets was already cut as if this had been tried out, returned and then re sold to me apparently.  This is just what I formed in my own opinion after opening my package.  Maybe I'm wrong, but as an avid consumer this was a different situation in my opinion and why was my seal already broken?",
