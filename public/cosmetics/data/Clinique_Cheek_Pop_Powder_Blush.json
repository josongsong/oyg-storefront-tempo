        "comments": "I LOVE blush. Like obsessed. If I have anything on for sure, it's blush. I typically use cream and liquid blushes and set with powder blush. Please note I don't typically shop in Clinique because it doesn't fit my needs. This blush, however, has such a smooth, buildable formula that it literally feels like a cream to powder. I originally bought one at a different store over a year ago and fell in love SO I grabbed some other shades at an Ulta sale. And y'all, I use that blush religiously and I'm nowhere near pan. The pigment is great, allowing the product to last longer. I HIGHLY recommend and I will not recommend anything I only like. I have to love it and have been using it long enough to really know the formula, how the pigment stays, and how it feels on the skin. 10/10",

The Heather Pop is such a gorgeous soft pink color and it has a nice finish; its not shimmery but not quite matte. I have a cooler skin tone and combination to oily skin. This blends quite well too. I love that it boasts buildable coverage, you can go for a more subtle natural or bold look. I want to try more colors now!",
