I do not have thick nor full brows but I was looking for a product that gives them a \"fuller\" effect and makes them look a bit \"cleaner\". \nThe things I like about this product: I enjoy the size of the product because it is very portable and fits into my small makeup bag. \nI enjoy the size of the spoolie brush because it allows me to work in sections and really get up close and detailed into the hairs I want to maintain. \nI like that it is clear and did not leave me with a white cast. \nNow for the cons: \nIt really did not hold my hairs down at all. Again, my eyebrows are neither thick nor bushy, and this product did little to hold them down. \nAdditionally, as others say, it does leave the brows feeling sticky and it does take a while to dry down. \nI achieved the \"laminated brow\" look for about 10 min before they just went back to their regular state. \nAdditionally, a lot of the product comes out on the spoolie so you have to constantly be removing product if not you're going to apply a hot mess onto your brows.\n\nIn all, this product may work for some, but it did nothing for me.",
