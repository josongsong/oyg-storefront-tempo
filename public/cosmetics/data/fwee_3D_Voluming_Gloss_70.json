It's a gorgeous color that has nice pigment with a beautiful glossy shine that gives juicy vibes from back in the day. It is the perfect addition for a \"clean girl\" makeup look. \n\nThe doe-foot applicator makes it feel fun and easy to swipe on, and the gel texture is smooth and cushiony without feeling sticky (HUGE plus!). I didn't notice any strong scent, just a lightly sweet, pleasant aroma, but it was hardly noticeable. \n\nIt layers nicely over anything and keeps lips looking hydrated and effortlessly glossy all day.  I'm glad I've found this brand as this gloss has made me a huge fan!",

The color is lychee and in my opinion it looks good with my skin tone. The pigment really pops and a little goes a long way. The gloss stays shiny for a long time. I experienced an instant plumping and major hydration thanks to the added Vitamin E. Personally, I love the lip applicator and its shape it makes it easy to apply.

The shade B01 Vanilla gives my lips that soft, milky-beige wash that looks so fresh and natural, almost like a perfect \"your lips but better\" nude. What makes it special is the 3D voluming effect it instantly makes my lips look fuller and smoother without feeling sticky or heavy. The formula is lightweight, cushiony, and has that glassy shine that just catches the light beautifully. I love that it layers well on its own or over lip liner and lipstick, giving me that plumped-up, juicy finish every time. It's one of those glosses that feels comfortable enough to wear all day, and the color is so versatile it pairs with any makeup look",

The box that it comes in is a little odd because the font and design makes it a little cheap, but the packaging of the product itself makes up for it. It has an iridescent and futuristic design that makes it unlike any product I've seen recently. The gloss smells fruity and the color Lychee is so pretty. It's a little stickier than I'd like a gloss to be, but it's very pretty on the lips and the slight stain it leaves is great. Not a huge fan of the applicator because I think a doe foot shape is best. Overall, very happy with this product and would recommend!",

It has some curves to it and I love how long and pointy the applicator is. This makes it perfect for getting into the corners of your lips as well as making the cupids bow look nice and sharp. It is super smooth feeling on the lips as well. Although it's a thick gloss and you can definitely tell it's there, it is not sticky at all which I love about it. There's not much of a scent but whatever it is is pleasant. It makes my lips feel super moisturized and doesn't have any plumping stinging effects if you are not into that. It makes your lips look super hydrated and I love the nice color that it gives them. It seems like there's not a ton of product for the price, but a little goes a long way so keep that in mind. I highly recommend! Thank you again for sending it to me!",
