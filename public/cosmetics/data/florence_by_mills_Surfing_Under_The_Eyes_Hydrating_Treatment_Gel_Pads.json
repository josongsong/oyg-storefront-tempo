This was my first time trying Surfing Under the Eyes. I have sensitive skin so they did tingle a bit at first but it was temporary. It was likely because I had just washed my face before applying them. I've never had an acne breakout from using them. They don't have a strong smell and are easy to apply. I like to store mine in the fridge for an hour or so before applying so they're extra cool on my skin. They give an extra dose of moisture to my skin, so a must have for dry winter season!",

It went away after that but when I woke up the next day , I really saw a difference. My eye-bag were less obvious. I didnt like how they were so easy to move though. One touch and they were like moving around all over. It was also kinda too wet? In some way. But I liked how it was cold and a depuffer.",
