Anyways I recently got this moisturizer to give it a shot since theres so many good reviews! When I tell you this moisturizer saved my skin… it saved my skin. My dry flakey skin was gone in a matter of seconds, the irritation also gone! My skin has never felt this soft and looked this good for a long while. This product does go a long way so a couple small dots all across the face will do! I definitely would repurchase this product in the future once I run out. Truly the best!",
