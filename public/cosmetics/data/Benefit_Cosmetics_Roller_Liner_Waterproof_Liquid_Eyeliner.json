I would leave it upside down all night to use in the morning and try shaking it and wetting it slightly but nothing worked. That second week it just appeared grey. I felt scammed of my money. It does last all day and have a beautiful matte finish after just buying but i wouldnt reach for this one for everday use anymore. Better options for price point that will last you longer.",

After using if for some time the tip wont be saturates enough no matter no much u keep it upside down. Its jet black and that beautiful but lasting power is just like any drugstote proxuct.

        "comments": "This eyeliner is great! I've been using it exclusively since receiving it to test and very pleased so far. It's a pen style so it's easy and comfortable to hold to get my line and wings precise. And if you find you have to go over lines, the product layers nicely without lifting or product build up. \n\nThe shade of black is BLACK, not grey. So know that the color is going to be bold. The liner isn't completely matte after the dry down. It had a semi satin finish but I did find it mattified later on. I wear glasses regularly but applied while wearing contacts did not irritate my eyes. The liner is also an easy removal with makeup remover or cleanser and doesn't flake off throughout the day. \n\nI love black liquid liner but usually find felt tip pen liners to not meet my needs since they either dry out too fast or the tip gets super flimsy or the tip is too hard that it hurts to apply. I tend to prefer brush tip since they're durable but flexible, but I have no complaints with Benefit's Roller Liner. Still I would make sure storage is tip side down so it's always ready for use and doesn't dry out (which sucks aesthetically since the cap is a cute hair roller but that's not a major con).\n\nMy only complaints are that it claims to last 24 hours & is waterproof. While I wouldn't wear makeup for a whole day, I can say it's pretty long lasting, just not 24 hours. Definitely at least ten to twelve hours for regular daily wear without excessive fading and the color is still black. But if you scratch or rub an itch by your eye or if you sort of tear up, your wing is going to fade slightly. I can't vouch for water running over my face to see if liner holds up but I doubt it can hold up for so long without fading or smudging, especially when you wipe water away. \n\nHowever this liquid liner is great. I'd probably buy it when \nI run out and I may look into the brown version.\n\n*I received this product for free from to test. All opinions are my own*",

        "comments": "The first time I used the Roller Liner, it was a disaster. Most of the time if I don't use eyeshadow, I like to put a concealer on my lids and then use a felt tip liner after it dries down. I have to say that this did not work well because it transfered on my top lid almost immediately and continued to do so throughout the day. With that being said, this would not be a good liner to use with just concealer, a paint pot, or a cream eyeshadow. If you use only a concealer on your lids or a paint pot, you have to either set your eyes with a translucent powder or use eyeshadow before applying the Roller Liner. I don't know how it performs on the lid by itself since I do not wear my makeup that way. When I used the Roller Liner with concealer and eyeshadow on top, it performed perfectly and I didn't experience any issues. \nIt claims to be 24hrs and I believe it is, but don't expect to sleep with it on and see it the next morning. It claims to be waterproof and I have to say that it is rather difficult to remove. I haven't tried swimming with it, but I'm more than positive it would survive a water test. The Roller Liner does dry down matte without flaking. You can go over your lines as many times as you want and the liner stays in place. For the most part, I would say the Roller Liner does create a smooth and continuous line, however I did experience a few times holding the applicator incorrectly (especially when creating a wing) can cause the liner to skip and not dispense product. I found the best way to apply the eyeliner is to use a light hand or the line ends up looking too thick. The packaging is cute, but the actual felt tip seemed too long in my opinion. \nAll in all, it's a great eyeliner, but the price is disappointing. I was excited to try this product out, but I don't feel like I was blown away. It was just okay. *I recieved this product compilmentary for testing purposes.*",
