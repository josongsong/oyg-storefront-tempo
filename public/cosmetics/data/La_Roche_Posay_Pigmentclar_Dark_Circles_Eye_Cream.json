        "comments": "I have always had dark circles under my eyes. They are due to genetics, but made worse by allergies, diet and more recently, age. I've tried a lot of eye creams. A lot of them made some improvement, but not tons.  It has reached the point when I've used 6 different eye creams at a time - each targeting something slightly different, and different day/night routines. I have also had times I've used only 1 product. \nPigmentclar simply has the most effect for me, hands down. I can't call it the Holy Grail eye cream for me - it doesn't tackle wrinkles as well as other products. It handles the darkness the best though (coupled with low, processed sugar dietl). It works best when I use it day and night, as the first product. I do follow with a Vitamin C moisturizer in the day, and a wrinkle tackling moisturizer at night. I still get darkness, but it's the best it's ever been.",

I bought this on a whim and after the 1st application I was hooked - the metal applicator is so cool on your eyes it feels great. And then by the 2d application (no kidding) I looked different... My eyes were dark and sunken and now they feel like a normal persons.. I bought this along with Redermic intensive and I am convinced I look a year younger every couple of days (3 weeks I think I look about 45 vs 53) Last week I saw a friend I hadn't seen in 2 weeks, her 1st words 'omg what r u using your skin looks phenomenal' and she went and purchased these",
