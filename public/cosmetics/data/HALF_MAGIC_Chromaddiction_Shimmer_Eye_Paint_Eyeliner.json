I love the window star peek of the color shade on the bottle/packaging. I like that the applicator allows me to control the precision when applying it to my eyelids. And that it gives you options to make designs using it. It feels creamy and cool when applying on my eyes and more of a liquid. It tends to dry fairly quickly, but I still wait 5-10 minutes before applying more layers and any other eye products on top of it. I love how vibrant it looks on my eyes and the fun pop of color. There were areas where I needed to apply multiple layers as it could be more see-through but I think that's just to my user error when not applying it evenly on my eyes. I also like that it tends to stay on all day long, and can work great as a party or casual look.",

        "comments": "It has a smooth application of an ethereal blue shimmer for the first swipe. The multidimensional pearls that reflect the light at every turn do give it a lilac/blue shift that is beautiful. It is buildable, with a second layer giving more opaque pigment, but if not done at the right stage of drying it can just smear the first layer away with the second like how dry-erase markers will erase itself. It cleans off without too much work as well. The applicator brush is not really useful if you were to do your own liner with it, but definitely works for all-over eyelid coverage.",

Unfortunately, Doni apparently doesn't know the difference between \"shimmer\" and \"glitter\" because this is full on GLITTER.  So why call it \"shimmer\"?  The name's incredibly misleading and whoever was the reviewer who called these \"subtle\" and \"shimmer\" is blind.  They're beautiful and durable and the packaging is beautiful but I bought \"shimmer eye paints\" expecting SHIMMER not sparkle.",
