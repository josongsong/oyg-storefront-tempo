The mask now is not as nourishing and to my unfortunate surprise, made my hair fallout. I also hate how cheap the jar feels, especially with wet hands, the thinness of the jar makes it harder to open. What a waste.",

We have tried other hair masks and just didn't like them. This one though, makes our hair feel so good. The mask itself is very thick. I use a good quarter size and work it through my hair after washing it, I rinse it after washing my body. It smells soo good! My hair gets oily fast due to pcos and this doesn't make it worse. It doesnt leave a weird residue after. Our hair types are medium to thick, coarse, wavy hair however, I think it would be fine for any hair type. I will definitely buy it again.",

It tames my frizz and gives me a subtle shine. I say its a win for me. It doesnt weight my hair down either. I have brown, long hair, not thick but not thin either and I have a good amount of it. Since i dont apply heat to it, I cant really appreciate the shines potential but I like it enough to continue using it. Ive seen improvement with frizz, no build up product or making it oily.",

I try to maintain a schedule of washing my hair every third day to maintain healthier hair, but also work out every day, so I am very conscious of products that may lead to greasiness or weigh my fine hair down.\r\n\r\nI have used Mane Magic three times now and have been pleased that I have not felt like my hair has felt dirtier on or before wash day.  I have left it on a little longer than the suggested 3-5 minutes merely for convenience. As soon as I wash it out, my hair feels MUCH softer. My hair seems smoother for the period of time I let it air dry (usually frizzes out) and I'm experiencing noticeably fewer tangles, which I think will help with my breakage issues. As to a mirrored, glass-like shine, I haven't experienced that however my hair is shinier, particularly the first and second days after washing. I would probably re-purchase, particularly at this price point.",

I was really excited to use it because I have never done any kind of hair mask before, and I'm super bummed it let me down. As a first time user, some instructions on how much to use would have been really nice to have. But since there wasn't, I started with small amounts and gradually increased how much I used each time. After a couple of weeks, I am now using quite a bit and don't see any reason the amounts being used shouldn't show results. However, I still have yet to notice any of the benefits this product promotes. The only real change I've noticed is that my naturally wavy hair actually seems to be less wavy, which is enough to make me want to stop using it. It smells quite nice, and I like the packaging. But unfortunately that is the only things I like about it.",
