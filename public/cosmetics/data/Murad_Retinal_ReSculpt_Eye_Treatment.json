After a few weeks of using this nightly I absolutely noticed my under eyes looked better and now after using it for about 4 months I have noticed a huge difference.  Did it erase the bags under my eyes?  Of course not but it looks noticeably much better and has given me some confidence back.  I have been so tired of wasting my money not knowing what would work and though this is expensive it is 100% worth it.",

However, upon opening mine, it is like a hard block. I just rub my fingers across the top and dab it on my eyes. But I haven't noticed any difference at all. So I think I really got sent a bad batch. I hope nobody else received this.  After looking at all the pics, it doesn't appear so and I wish they would send me a new one. I already had an issue with my shipping and they had to send out a new shipment of the entire order just to receive defective merchandise. For this much money, you would think the order would be checked to make sure everything looked okay! Really disappointed with Ulta, for the first time ever!",

As someone who struggles with fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes, I have tried numerous products in the past, but none have compared to this one.\n\nFirst off, I love that this treatment contains retinal, a powerful form of Vitamin A that helps to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. This ingredient is also known for its ability to improve skin texture and firmness, which is exactly what I was looking for.\n\nThe texture of the product is smooth and lightweight, making it easy to apply and absorbs quickly into the skin. I also appreciate that it is fragrance-free and gentle on the delicate skin around the eyes.\n\nAfter using this treatment consistently for a few weeks, I have noticed a significant improvement in the appearance of my fine lines. They are much less noticeable and my skin feels firmer and smoother. I also love that this product has helped to brighten my under-eye area, making me look more awake and refreshed.\n\nAnother aspect I appreciate about this eye lift treatment is the packaging. The pump dispenser makes it easy to control the amount of product I need and ensures that the product stays fresh and hygienic.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the Murad Retinal Eye Lift Treatment to anyone looking for an effective and gentle solution to combat fine lines and wrinkles around the eyes. It has become a staple in my skincare routine and I can't imagine going without it now. Thank you, Murad, for creating such an amazing product!",

However, upon opening mine, it is like a hard block. I just rub my fingers across the top and dab it on my eyes. But I haven't noticed any difference at all. So I think I really got sent a bad batch. I hope nobody else received this.  After looking at all the pics, it doesn't appear so and I wish they would send me a new one. I already had an issue with my shipping and they had to send out a new shipment of the entire order just to receive defective merchandise. For this much money, you would think the order would be checked to make sure everything looked okay! Really disappointed with Ulta, for the first time ever!",
