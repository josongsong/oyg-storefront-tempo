It is very hydrating and somehow not very heavy/sticky on your lips.\nMy problem is that like the Lemonade lip treatment by Lanolips this tube where the cap and tube screw together split. So now every time I try to squeeze some of the balm out it squeezes out the side. Its such a waste and I am very disappointed in how it somehow split when I have only been using it for about two weeks.",

I like the feel, but sometimes I can't keep it on because of the taste and smell.  I hate to waste product so I'll use this with something else I guess.  I like the tube though, it's skinny easy to fit into pockets when needed.  hasn't made a mess.",

I have one in the car, a couple in my purse, my gym bag, night stand, coffee table, kitchen counter--the list goes on.  So many products just aren't as great as they claim to be.  This one is wonderful.  My lips are instantly smoothed and soothed, it layers very well under lipstick if needed, and the dreamy, light banana scent and flavor is so pleasant.  Love it!",

        "comments": "I purchased this because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I hate it. It moisturizes fairly well but I could only use it at night. First off: it doesn't go on totally clear but gives a slight white cast to your lips, even when put on thinly, so it cannot be worn alone unless you enjoy looking like a sickly ghost. That being said, if you try to put anything over it, even hours later, it will clump up any type of lipstick, balm or gloss. Like really clump up. Like embarrassing lip scum clump up. I tried using it in my routine regularly by putting it on as I started my makeup routine and scrubbing it off with a washcloth when I was finished, which worked fine except for the one out of every three days I would forget to do that and end up with nasty lips bothering me at work all day long. Absolutely infuriating. I thought that this would be better than the Bite lip mask because those are just a touch sticky and a reviewer said this is not sticky. It is super sticky. I also thought it would be cheaper but you end up using quite a bit more than you need to with Bite lip masks so it ends up being a waste. Super disappointed with this purchase.",
