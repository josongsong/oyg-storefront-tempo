        "comments": "I got this for my 16-year-old daughter, who has a hereditary puffy under-eye. It works wonders! Every time she uses it, someone asks her what she did differently with her eyes. I used it under my forty-some-year-old under eye. It's really wonderful, not greasy or shiny looking, but hydrating and very smoothing yet very lightweight. I certainly see brighter undereye when I use it, and if I'm using concealer, it sits smoothly over it. No irritation or itchy eyes, and I even use it for my upper eyelid too. I will definitely buy many more to stack up during the 50% sale on September 18th.",

I saw absolutely no difference in puffiness, dark circles, or texture. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is that it is pleasant to apply and feels cooling. I guess it could work as an overpriced gel moisturizer for the eye area, but only if you need a light moisture. This does not deliver a lot of moisture. I liked it for day time but use something much thicker for night time. I have combo skin and am 42 with some fine lines, for what it's worth. I would never pay more than say $5-10 for this product.",

I already use Belif products (the moisturzing eye cream & moisturizing bomb face cream) so I'm already familiar with the brand, and this is now another item I'm keeping in my daily routine. \n\nIt's a thin, clear gel and feels so refreshing in the morning. I love how quickly it absorbs into the skin so I can put it on whenever I want a little boost of moisture under my eyes. And it literally helps me look so much more awake in the morning! Idk how it does it but it does haha \n\nAgain, love this product!! I've already bought it twice when on sale to stock up.",

The only caution would be what's expected, don't get it directly in the eyes because it'll burn pretty badly.\n\nIt's doing a great job healing my skin after I wasn't in the best health.

I've always suffered from bad dark circles from being pale, having deep set eyes, and thin skin in that area. I have tried countless vitamin c, retinol, other brightening products that made zero difference because I realized the issue is not discolored skin for me, the area is sunken and needs to be plumped. Caffeine and hyaluronic acid products seem to be the only thing that helps fill the area. I have tried the Yerba eye gel as well, but did not notice much difference. I can see a significant visible difference using this within an hour. The photos are before/after of only one use with an hour time difference, I imagine the results will be even better after a few weeks.",

I saw absolutely no difference in puffiness, dark circles, or texture. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is that it is pleasant to apply and feels cooling. I guess it could work as an overpriced gel moisturizer for the eye area, but only if you need a light moisture. This does not deliver a lot of moisture. I liked it for day time but use something much thicker for night time. I have combo skin and am 42 with some fine lines, for what it's worth. I would never pay more than say $5-10 for this product.",
