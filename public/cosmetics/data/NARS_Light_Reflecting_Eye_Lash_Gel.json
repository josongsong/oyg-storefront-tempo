It makes it seamless. I finally ran out and had been using some other cream and well. It just didnt stand up at all.",

This one is great for me...light texture that absorbs well and takes concealer beautifully and holds it most of the day. So happy I found something.",

        "comments": "I was on the fence about buying this because I have a really strong bench of skin care heavy hitters (serums, eye creams, moisturizers, peels, you name it).  I am SO glad I bought this.  It absorbs amazingly well, but beyond that my under eyes have remained moisturized through a 12 hour workday and even after a long nap I woke up to my eyes still looking smooth and plump and moisturized which is even more amazing when you consider it's winter and I've been indoors with the heat pumping.  I came back to buy more immediately.  I hope Nars always makes this!  I am in my early 40s for reference and have dry / combination skin.",
