I have used this product for 4 years to wash my face every night, and it is the best for removing makeup at the end of the day - I always feel super clean too! Also, for the past 4 years, I have been generally acne free, and I attribute that to this product. The product removes all oils/makeup/etc. from your face, so afterwards, your face may feel a little dry. However, it isn't a problem if you put on your favorite moisturizer afterwards. The only con about this cleanser is that if it cakes at the top, it will clog the tube, but it is easy to unclog with a toothpick.",

That is not necessarily bad but it will make you breakout for about 2 weeks then all the sudden BAM my breakouts have flattened, my texture is improving, and my skin is softer! Gycolic acid will generally cause some sort of purge (you can look it up if you don't believe me lol) but as long as you stick with the wash, don't give up, you'll start seeing some decent results in a couple weeks. I use in conjunction w/ heritage store rose water, cosrx snail mucin, and then cerave daily moisturizer. My acne is typically hormonal & cystic along my jaw but when I purged it was around my cheeks. A purge is not a bad reaction.. a bad reaction is when your skin has small bumps/redness/itching/burning/stinging I DID NOT have this reaction.. my purge was cystic that eventually formed white heads. I tried my best not to pick or pop the white heads. My skin never burned or was irritated while I used this face wash. I hope this helps anyone with acne!",

I tried the drying approach, salycillic acid, benzyl peroxide, and azelic acid from drugstore and name brand. Anything from Neutrogena, to Clinique, Estee Lauder, Somerville, Murad, Kiehls, Curology, Proactive, and even things you've probably never heard of. Then I tried the natural approach; rose hip oils, tea tree, and assorted natural serums. I did the prescriptions topical creams, the prescription antibiotics and nothing seemed to really work. This face wash leaves my face tight but SO clean. I leave it on as a mask and when I wash it off, my face feels FRESH and I have not had a new breakout or pimple since I started this wash. Though this seems like a men's brand, I am a woman and I can honestly say this is curing my acne, slowly, but surely. If you feel like you have tried everything, forget the price and try this wash and couple it with the clean break moisturizer. I do not regret my decision at all.",

And for YEARS I was looking for a replacement. Could be used as a mask or wash, Clay, Ash, no perfume smell, just WORKED. \n\nGendered products are stupid, use what works for your skin. This. Works. Because it's a \"mans\" product it just means it doesn't smell like flowers and shame. GOOD. I want to smell clean. Not like flowers. \n\nKeeps breakouts down to a minimum, doesn't overdry and make me flake and no stupid useless micro beads that are terrible for your drain. Use good product. \n\nThe cap has had an issue the last 6 bottles I've bought where some product collects after each use and dries out so maybe a different design might be needed.",

        "comments": "I love this face wash in combination with the clean break oil free moisturizer. I have SUPER sensitive skin, everything I try is either too strong and irritates my skin or is not strong enough. I was on the hunt for a face wash and stumbled across this . I know it's supposed to be for men but this is the perfect face wash for my adult acne . I lather it up as a face wash rubbing it in circular motions for a minute then as it starts to dry up on my face I add a little more to use it as a mask and leave it for 5 minutes. I then apply the clean break moisturizer, with this moisturizer I like that it's light and my skin quickly soaks it up. It does not leave any kind of greasy film. Within the past week of using both products my face has quickly cleared up and my makeup is applying perfectly . I am also realizing that my makeup is lasting longer and not getting greasy as fast as it would . I will say I am getting a few small pimples as this face wash is cleaning the gunk out of my pores but just as they come they are quickly going away . Sn: I realized that my face did not like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide so I am happy to say that the glycolic acid in this face wash is not causing any irritation .",

I'm a woman btw, and I'm definitely going to check out more men's products lol",

I was so enchanted by it, I've since purchased a good amount of bottles and only just recently flipped the bottle to look at the ingredients.  \n\nAfter a few months of use, I began to see patchy, irritated spots on the skin surrounding the eye area despite my avoiding it.  Based on some further research into the composition of the wash, I believe I exhibited some reaction to the ridiculous amount of fragrance within it.  I understand that it's hard to market a product that doesn't smell pretty but it really makes me not want to repurchase if I continue to experience this reaction due to a set of fragrances that in no way assist the skin.",
