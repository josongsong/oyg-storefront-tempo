It is also easy on my sensitive and acne prone skin. I would recommend this to anyone with these issues. I follow up afterwards with my treatments and moisturizers. It seems to work well with those too.",

Turns out, it contains coconut oil which my skin is not a fan of. So I took a chance to try this and omg, let me tell you -- it applies the same way as the balm; onto dry face and rinse with water. Though there's no foam, I felt like it was working in removing some of my makeup that a wipe wasn't able to (I use that first since it was my first time trying this product). Works on waterproof mascara too! I was kind of scared to wake up the next day with a breakout since my skin is also sensitive. Lo, behold, that wasn't the case! I was glowing!! Next time I'll try to use this without a wipe prior. Hope this doesn't discontinue! I'll keep repurchasing.",
