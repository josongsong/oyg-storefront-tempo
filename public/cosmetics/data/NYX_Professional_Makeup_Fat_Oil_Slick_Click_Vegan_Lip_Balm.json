It seems to stay in place a little better than liquid glosses, and is a little stickier than a balm but not as much as the lip glosses I'm used to. the color payoff is nice, but sheer enough to make the color look natural. It stays glossy and feels nice and hydrating. I'm also a fan of the scent, which is a very light, creamy sort of raspberry.",

The pigmented balm in click up packaging dispenses just the right amount of formula every time, all I have to do is to click the bottom green button, and it dispenses just the right amount of formula needed to hydrate my lips.\n\nThis lightweight, buildable balmy formula provides my lips 12 hours of hydration for all day ultra-comfortable wear and care.  Moreover, this Vegan formula powered with avocado, cloudberry and raspberry oils gives a fat boost of fat care for my lips.  The Double Tap - Raspberry shade is super attractive and makes my lips look so gorgeous that people keep on asking me what I have been wearing on my lips.\n\nI have already recommended the NYX Professional Makeup Fat Oil Slick Click Vegan Lip Balm, in Double Tap - Raspberry shade to many of my friends and family and several of them have already purchased and used this lip balm on their lips and are absolutely happy to use it since this lip balm is Vegan and is powered with avocado, cloudberry and raspberry oils.",

When thinking about the amount of plastic on this earth and how there's a bunch of non recyclable parts to this, it really should have just been much simpler. Obviously I acknowledge that I'm buying from this makeup brand because it's cheap and therefore it's objectively wasteful. That being said, why isn't it just a smaller, simple container?",
