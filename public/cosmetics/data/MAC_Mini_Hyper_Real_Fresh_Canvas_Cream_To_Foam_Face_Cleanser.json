I love a foamy cleanser, and the fact that this facewash literally makes my skin squeek. It also leaves a shine and removes all my makeup.. I have no idea why you wouldn't want a face wash that truly cleanses. I purchased this and its a huge bottle, so for the price it will definitely last!",

        "comments": "The Hyper Real Fresh Canvas Cleanser has undeniably set a new standard in my skincare routine, and the cream-to-foam formulation is nothing short of a revelation. From its transformative texture to its revitalizing effects, this cleanser has become a daily indulgence that I eagerly anticipate.\n\nThe standout feature of this cleanser is its unique cream-to-foam formula. As soon as it touches the skin, the luxurious cream effortlessly glides on, providing a soothing and calming sensation. What sets it apart is the seamless transition into a lightweight foam upon contact with water. This dual-action ensures a thorough cleanse that removes impurities, excess oil, and makeup while maintaining a gentle touch.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of Hyper Real's cleanser is its ability to cleanse without stripping the skin of its natural moisture. It strikes the perfect balance, leaving my face feeling refreshed and clean, yet incredibly soft and supple. The hydrating properties are a game-changer for someone like me with combination skin – a thorough cleanse without the dreaded tightness.\n\nThe packaging of the cleanser is both practical and visually appealing. The sleek design adds a touch of sophistication to my skincare shelf. It's evident that attention to detail has been considered in every aspect of this product.\n\nThe scent is subtle yet invigorating, creating a spa-like experience during each use. It's a delightful blend that adds a sensory element to my skincare routine without being overpowering or irritating.\n\nI have noticed a positive difference in my skin's clarity and texture since incorporating this cleanser into my daily routine. It seems to promote a healthy glow and has become a vital step in achieving a fresh canvas before applying any additional skincare products.",

The smell reminds me of the Soap & Glory brand, very rich and mature as well as that vintage feel. Unfortunately, I noticed that this cleanser doesn't hold up in comparison to my favorites and it's twice the price. It also doesn't much much sense to me that you can't use it anywhere near the eyes, as it's described as a foaming cleanser and foaming cleansers expand. However, this cleanser doesn't foam up as advertised and it's very drying. I mistakenly had the misfortune of putting this near my eyes and it stung worse than any cleanser I've ever used. It also doesn't cleanse very deeply as I noticed there was some makeup still on my face and had to use another cleanser to get the job done. I truly wouldn't recommend this to anyone especially those with dry skin like mine. There are so many more amazing cleansers on the market that are more affordable and won't make your eyes burn.",
