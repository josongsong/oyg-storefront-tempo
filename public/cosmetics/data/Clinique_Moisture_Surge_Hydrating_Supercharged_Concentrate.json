In my honest opinion, with how similar the formulas are, this one is all you will ever need. It leaves my skin feeling soft, hydrated, and plump all day. It absorbs quickly and completely into the skin and the aloe has a light cooling affect that is very enjoyable to use. Combine this product with the moisture surge face spray and 100h moisturizer and you will not be disappointed. My oily dehydrated skin has never looked and felt so good.",

I was hesitant to try this product because I thought it would over hydrate my face and make my t-zone more oily than it already is since every moisturizer that I have tried does that. OMG, that was NOT the case with this one! I have never had a moisturizer that has perfectly hydrated my face and kept it oil-free. This product is it! I wake up and wash my face in the morning, removing and left overs of my night cream. I pat my face dry and apply the gel on my face in a light layer. I must say at first, its almost too light that I feel that I need to apply more but I don't. Then I wait about a minute and start my make-up routine. Let me also say that before using this product, no matter how much setting powder or setting spray or moisturizer I used, my skin would get oily in about 2 hours. Now, let me tell you that after using this product, by the end of the day, my oily t-zone was gone! I was shocked!!! I didn't have too blot or anything.! My face stayed sooo soft and nice all day. This thing is gold! Please give it a try if you have skin like mine! If not, just return it if it doesn't work for u lol. Hope this help!",

        "comments": "So i am a true skincare/all beauty junkie. I have a serious problem with constantly buying skin products, to \"help\" and \"clear\" my very oily, sensitive, consistently clogged, face. I have tried so many creams, gels, face washes, toners, treatments (besides chemical peel) to help clear my skin. My issue is not your typical \"Acne\",but rather a face full of closed comedones. Closed comedones are the flesh colored bumps on your skin, that won't budge, won't pop, but makes your skin texture bumpy and rough. Open comedones are visible pimples, and cystic acne that can be popped, where as closed comedones can be squeezed, yet never pop. It's because the pore is completely blocked with oil, dirt, and sebum. Nothing has ever gotten rid of them, and I have tried everything high and low. Having closed comedones and sensitive, oily skin, I really have to watch what I put on my face. I have experimented many different gel hydrators, moisturizers, eat, because cream or lotion moisturizers break me out so bad, and just cause more closed comedones. I use the Clinique 3 step system for oily skin, which really doesn't improve my face neither, but still use it. When I used the sample of this Moisture surge, Hydrated concentrate, I literally fell in love with this stuff. The little deluxe sample lasted me for about a week. I used it twice a day, morning and night, and I finally thought I found the right product for my face, which was a miracle. I gave the rest of the sample to my grandmother, and told her to try it, while I went to ulta and bought the full size. Now that i have been using this consistently off and on, I can say this product is decent, but not amazing. I feel like the sample worked better on my skin, than the full sized I own. True, it does moisturize, and it does even out my oily skin and sebum production, but this does nothing for my texture (closed comedones) I figured using this consistently, I would see some type of improvement in my skin problems overall, but this didn't really do anything for it. Also, if you pop a pimple, don't put this on afterwards, because IT WILL BURN. With that being said, It is a good lightweight, gel moisturizer for oily and combination skin. If you have acne, or closed comedones all over your face like me, this does nothing for it. It doesn't make it worse neither, it just kinda sits there, and keeps your skin matte. It's also sticky a bit after you first apply it, which makes it great for a primer. I don't wear makeup alot (because makeup emphasizes texture) and that's the last thing I wanted people to see, But I'm an avid makeup collector too, and this is a nice primer for preapplication for your foundation. This is not a Savior. This stuff is not a miracle gel. It's just decent. That's the best word to describe it. This is a 100% accurate review, so if you have skin like me.. Now you know. I'm sure this would be wonderful for dry skin, combination skin, and even oily skin with no acne, or texture issues. Man, what I would do for a clear face. One day, I will find the answer. Until then, Ill keep trying and reviewing for all the skin care junkies out there like me, who struggle with acne, closed comedones, and oily skin.",
