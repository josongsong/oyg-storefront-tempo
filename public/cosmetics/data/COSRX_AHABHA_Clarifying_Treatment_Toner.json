I randomly started getting some whiteheads that wouldnt go away (i have acne prone skin but whiteheads are not my norm), so i wanted to give this a try. I was really excited at first as it seemed to work overnight. The morning following the first use (and every use following) my skin immediately looked plumper and nice. But as the day and following days went on it went back to bumpy and seemed to get worse. I thought maybe skin was purging due to the product causing a faster cell turnover. After builing up the tolerance for it it did not help. I took a break and went back to simple skin care (cleanser and moisturizer) and skin cleared up. I decided to give it another try a couple months later to see if the same thing would happen and sure enough it made it worse for me again. Im not sure why it initially appears to work but is misleading. It sucks that products work differently for everyone but this was my experience.",

        "comments": "I really do believe this does something because my skin definitely went through a purge phase for the first month (so don't start this before an important picture time). But this was also my first time using an AHA/BHA.\nA lot of the whiteheads turned into small pimples (different than my typical oily-skin hormonal acne). Thankfully after a full month my skin finally settled. The thing is, my skin still gets hormonal pimples, still has scars, and my pores are still visible. BUT, I'm not getting anymore tiny whitehead acne.\n\nIt's not a miracle worker, but I do think I'll keep this in my routine. Btw it DOES have a sting to it if you have broken skin, but it doesn't actually irritate my skin. It helps having a really good moisturizer (but when wouldn't it). After purchasing this I used it right after the shower (where I used the good morning gel cleanser), and right before my ultra repair moisturizing cream.",

        "comments": "My skin is dehydrated, but still acne prone at pushing 70. With an Asian/K approach, you need to balance the acid mantle at the first, toner step.  BHA gets deep in the pores and does that, with zero frills.  Not an American style alcohol based toner.  Though it will remove any cleansing residue, that is not the point. If you have, as K regimes call it, 'trouble' skin, you need bha in the first layer. Even for decent skin, it renders any of the following skincare steps more effective.  For me, this is a must-have, HG product.  If I leave it out, my skin clogs. It may not be enough bha for oily types...you may need another bha layer.  Cosrx has blackhead power essence for that.  Having no alcohol, it is not drying.  This is one of the top products I have found in ~50 years of skincare.  No frills.  If you like a straightforward, ingredients-driven approach, Cosrx is for you.  And it won't empty your wallet, either.  I'm out of this now, and my skin shows it!  When I follow a PC/ Cosrx routine, even the SAs say 'What acne?  You don't have acne!''  Most Cosrx products have a minimal ingredients list.  As with food, that is usually better for you.  If you use Cosdna to check ingredients, as I have to, you NEVER see warnings.  Products are very likely to be allergy/sensitivity friendly and unfragranced.  Just targeted ingredients that work.  Cosrx rules.  Thanks, Ulta, for starting 3 Cosrx products.  Need I say, go for more?",

        "comments": "I love several other toners and essences from CosRX so wanted to give a bottle of this a go as I do have sensitive acne and blemish prone skin.\nThis was unfortunately super drying for my skin, ironically as the most watery toner I've ever tried, and it did not suit my dry skin type at all - I normally use toners to hydrate my full body's skin before moisturizing, and this just left me so dry that even following with a moisturizer I love and trust was noticeably feeling a lot less soft and I felt dry again much quicker. I tried to make this work by trying every body moisturizer I had, but it just wasn't working. So I actually was ready to dump with out, but decided to mix this with another toner that doesn't have active ingredients in it so I could use it on my feet before putting vaseline over them in hopes my feet wouldn't suffer so much like my body's skin. I can't use this as a toner on my body like every toner I have used before, so it is definitely not suited to my skin's needs sadly.\nI like enough products by this brand that I don't think I will stop using anything else I've enjoyed by them because of this, but as this is the 2nd product I do not enjoy by them, I will just be sticking to what I like rather than try to experiment with anything else now.",
