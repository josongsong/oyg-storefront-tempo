I use it in the morning and night and now I never miss a day.\r\n\r\nI had noticeable bags and dark circles under my eyes.  On a Zoom call a few months ago, a co-worker called out my bags under my eyes.  After getting over the embarrassment, I knew they were right.  I've been searching for products to help me but nothing has really worked ... until now.\r\n\r\nWithin two weeks of using the Eyelighter, I can see a noticeable difference in the puffiness under my eyes and the dark circles have almost disappeared.  The tool is super easy to use and dispense.  I apply the cream directly on my eye using the tool and glide it under my eye and up to the side.  I can feel the build up of liquid under my eyes move out and back into my circulation system and my eyes are less puffy.  The cream actually brightens my eyes as well.\r\n\r\nI am so happy with this product and cannot wait to be on another Zoom call with my co-worker and have them comment on how incredible my eyes now look.",
