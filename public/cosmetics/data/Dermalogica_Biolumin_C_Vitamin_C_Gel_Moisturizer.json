        "comments": "I love all of Dermalogica products. This is like a mix of a cream serum compound to me but a cream texture. I have a tiny face and it takes two pumps to get the adequate amount I need for my face and neck. It dries on the skin very quickly but not dries like you cant feel it, dries like you can't spread it. So you have to get it everywhere you want quickly. Then it is very tacky so it should be the last thing you apply. If you apply anything afterwards you will get pilling. All that being said it does wonders for my skin. Leaves my skin glowing and fresh after i use it. It plumps it up and helps my pores as well skin texture. Its an amazing vitC face product. I find it hard to fall in love with vitC skincare products but always want to have one in my regimen. This has been the only one that truly does everything it promises to do. It does have some cons but i just dont use it on days I'm planning on wearing makeup. If you are a daily makeup wearer id recommend using it either hours before or in the evening. You get a good amount for the price. Its got a nice dispenser. Overall i give 5 stars cause not everything can be completely perfect in every aspect but if you get what you want from it can you really be upset.",

        "comments": "This product was gifted by Dermalogica to test out...here's what I thought. (For reference I'm 42, have dry/combo skin, and discolored spots from sun damage.)  It has a strong first scent of orange/citrus when first pumping it out but afterward smells herbal-y. It was a strange scent change since I couldn't detect an orange scent on my hands afterward, just the herbal smell. It happened every time and I still haven't figured out what magic does this. It's not unpleasant but I wanted to mention it just in case someone else wonders if they had a stroke.  I expected a gel but it's actually a light cream. I was pleasantly surprised because I was wondering if a gel would be enough moisture for my dry-ish skin. It felt really good going on, soothing and cool. I did not use a moisturizer on top in order to really test it.  The first thing I noticed (after a few days) is that I didn't need to exfoliate as often as usual. If you have dry skin you'll know what I mean; The dry skin kind of builds up and needs a good exfoliation or your skin will look dull. It really worked to chemically exfoliate, so no scrubbing was needed.  Using it twice a day, my skin felt fine. I didn't dry out or get itchy. It's a good lightweight hydrator but I know I'll need something more nourishing in the cold weather. I also noticed after around a week that my dark spots looked a little more faded and my complexion is a little more even.   Overall this is a really good product that performs the way it says it will, which should be the norm but often isn't. I liked getting the 3-in-1 of a chemical exfoliant and dark spot corrector inside a hydrating moisturizer. It could definitely cut down on the amount of product I usually buy for my skincare routine. I'll for sure keep using it!",

        "comments": "I love vitamin C serums and creams. I have about three that are my favorites and I'm always trying to find something new. Unfortunately, this serum/ gel moisturizer is loaded with a lot of photosensitizing ingredients, fragrance, and unnecessary ingredients that detract from the product. Strong fragrance has no place in face products. My husband could smell me approaching after I put this on. It smells great, but it's not worth the migraine. This product immediately bring me and gave me a headache from the strong scent. I don't react this way to the other vitamin C products that I have, so I don't understand why I react so strongly to this. It's not like vitamin C is a new product to my face. Vitamin C is a product that should be more during the day, but some of these ingredients are known to cause reactions when combined with the sun. Why on earth would they be in this product? Here are some of the culprits: Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Extract, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Raspberry Ketone, Jasminum Sambac (Jasmine) Flower Extract, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil,\n\nMy skin burned immediately upon contact with the serum. I tried to wait it out to see if I can get better, but then I developed hives. I still have them even after several hours and a Benadryl. I didn't even go in the sun, so I can't imagine how horrible the reaction would be if I had done that.\n\nI received this product for free.",
