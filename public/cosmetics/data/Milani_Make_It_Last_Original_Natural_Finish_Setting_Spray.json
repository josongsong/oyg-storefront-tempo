This setting spray caused my makeup to separate after 3 hours. I saw videos saying to apply it immediately after skin care and then apply a final coat after completing makeup. Unfortunately, this technique didn't work either. I will keep looking for my holy grail.",

If it is the reason why then it makes my makeup seperate due to the oiliness .",

My biggest issue is my mascara tends to collect under my eyes but I don't like waterproof so I have been trying to find an affordable setting spray that keeps my makeup in tact. So far this setting spray has been great, I do notice after about 6-7 hours my mascara does find its way under my eyes but it's nothing like it looks if I dont use a setting spray. I love the natural dewy finish of this setting spray as well, I have dry acne prone skin and this does wonders for keeping my makeup glowy and it does not bother my acne at all. I don't wear a lot of makeup, mainly concealer and blush, and usually by the end of the day both have disappeared but with this spray I still look like I'm wearing makeup and I am very happy with that!",

I had than blowed dried my hair and flat ironed it on the highest setting in the same space without opening a door or window as it was cold outside and the heat was on. I however do not tolerate heat well and in turn sweat profusely and after applying my makeup in the past sweating would always be a problem for me. With my makeup smearing and streaking from the beads of sweat. After applying my makeup this time I used the setting spray as directed and no evidence of streaking or smearing was visible. I am very happy with this product and recommend it! The price is right and the product is great! What more do you need?",
