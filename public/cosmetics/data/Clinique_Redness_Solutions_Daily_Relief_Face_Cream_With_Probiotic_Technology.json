I have red in my face and in one area is my right cheekbone that really stands out more red.   I apply my foundation and it covers some what but that cheek bone still shows red.  After washing off my makeup I applied the Redness Solution cream. I was amazed in the morning that I could see a difference in my face.  My cheek bone was still red but the red was lighter, yep lighter. The rest of my face was better.  I have been using it in the morning and no foundation primer.  Really it works for me without using a primer.  That's because one less step, and at night.   I absolutely love this cream.  Finally found something that works.  Morning I do shave and applying this cream after does not burn nothing, i do not put any other cream on.   I wait a few minutes just enough to set up my train case to get ready to my makeup on.  Night time I go through removing everything and use my clarifying lotion then apply my Redness cream.  Thats it.  It doesn't pill on me it's nice cream. It's not greasy.  Its been a month now.  My foundation looks better and  I checked outside and it looks good.  That's a plus.  I have many points and will use them to buy another jar.  Hoping for a sale.",

My cheeks would get so red and actually feel like they were burning and I'd never let anyone see me without makeup. Tried so many products. My dermatologist told me stick to a simple routine and don't fall into the fads of multiple products.  I started using this after cleansing and using the level 1 toner and after a few days what a difference. I now use it every morning, goes very well under my primer and foundation, and use it every evening. I'll follow with Farmacy Honey Halo at night and on days I'm not wearing makeup. My skin finally feels comfortable and I don't look crazy red all the time.  Highly recommend this product. Give it a consistent try if you have red sensitive skin and I hope you get relief like I have. Been using over a year now .",

By day 4 my face has itchy and burning. I am so sad. I don't typically react to skin care products like that. I am not sure what could be irritating my skin, but this is definitely causing inflammation. I'm disappointed that it cost this much for me to have recieved that kind of reaction.",

Well no sooner, Clinique discontinued COC forever and replaced it with this, Redness Solutions.\n\nRedness Solutions is nowhere near as great as COC was. As a replacement for the superior product it will have to do because even though it pales in comparison there is still nothing out there that compares for sensitive skin.\n\nAs a heavy duty moisturizer for highly sensitive skin and eczema sufferers this is better than anything else out there now that COC is gone. As a solution for redness...it has done nothing to change the tone of my skin or even it out in any way. I do not necessarily have a \"redness\" issue though, so I am probably not the best person to comment. I do, however, have red areas and as I said, this has not changed that for me a bit.\n\nIn addition, you must use only the absolute bare minimum amount at a time or else the product begins to \"pill\" up on your skin and can cause zits. Starting off with a tiny amount until your skin adjusts is probably a good idea.\n\nIn all, for people with extremely dry, sensitive skin and bad skin allergies this is a must-have but it just doesn't seem THAT great when compared to the product it replaced.",
