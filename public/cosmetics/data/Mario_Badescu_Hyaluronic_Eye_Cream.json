        "comments": "I am almost 40 and have been testing a variety of anti-aging products over this past year.  My eyes are showing minimal to no aging - no lines or crows feet, but now is the time to be preventive.  I purchased 2 eye creams: the Mario Badescu Hyaluronic Eye Cream and 1 from a well known global brand 2X the price of this one, both about the same size.  I chose the global brand because I tried a deluxe sample in my early 30s, which I liked but didn't need an eye cream then.  I chose this Hyaluronic eye cream based on reviews and I am glad I did.  It's been about 4 months and I noticed that my eyes are brighter, hydrated, and youthful.  I am of Indian descent and the skin around my eyes looks somewhat darker then the rest of my skin, but it is not dark circles from aging, I think it is an ethnic issue.  I immediately notice that discoloration gone.  I never realized that the skin around my eyes was not hydrated enough. I use wear eyeshadow on lids to cover it up, but I don't have to anymore.  This formulation is also non-greasy, your skin just looks well moisturized.  Whereas the pricier global brand was greasy and thick, I could only put it on at night and it clogged my pores on the side of my nose causing breakouts similar to my teens.  So far, this is the only anti-aging product that I am satisfied with and have added to my daily routine.  It is worth a try, but please keep in mind that I don't have lines around my eyes to comment on those results.",

        "comments": "I remember reading some reviews before buying this eyecream; one was about clogged pores and tiny dots that could occur from this product but, since I'd seen so many other great reviews as well, i decided to purchase this anyway. A month later, i truly regret it and i cant do anything but warn anyone looking to buy this. It didn't work for me to say the least, wish i would've listened to that tiny bumps warning.",
