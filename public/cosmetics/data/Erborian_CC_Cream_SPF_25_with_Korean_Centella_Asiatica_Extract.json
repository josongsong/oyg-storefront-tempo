I wish they would clarify your skin tone before sending samples because I could have totally felt differently if it matched my skin better, but unfortunately you could easily see when I had rubbed it off of my nose or my chin. It also built up extra dark color around the edges of my face. I just blended it in but I've never had this issue before with other CC creams. Maybe a bit too much color. I could do with less coverage.\n\nAlso, I felt like I looked spotty. It wasn't quite a smooth one color look. It was textured visually, but it didn't flake really except for with my blush but I think I was blending too much lol.\nNow I did like the feel and smell of it. Idk why some people had an issue with the smell it's nothing crazy for a cream to smell like cream. 🤦‍♀️😅\n\nAnyway, for the price, I'd definitely buy something better. This would be a decent budget option, but my review is based mostly on the price. It also has almost nothing beneficial in it except the centella asciatica. But Koreans love their one ingredient skin care. I however, prefer a powerhouse. Tyvm.",
