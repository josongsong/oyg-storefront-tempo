It's so hard to find true cool toned lip products and these are that, PLUS they have crazy longevity for a gloss, and have great shine and sparkle. I would loveee to see more shades of this come out! Especially ones like Blushing Lizard that have an almost duochrome effect to it. That and Chaos Prone I am able to wear on their own, but I do like pairing a brown liner with Y2K Cherub because of its frostiness. It makes the most gorgeous, frosty, milky pink lip combo.",

Problem Child is bolder for a late-night look, but I think you could wear Blushing Lizard anywhere. The glitter isn't gritty, so it feels smooth on the lips. My one gripe is with the applicator. The first time I opened my first bottle, the doe foot came off the rest of the wand and got stuck in the top of the bottle! I was able to pull it out with tweezers and use Gorilla Glue to stick both parts of the applicator back together, but it was still disappointing. Granted, this only happened on one of my two purchased bottles, and the other one has been fine so far. Just be careful, I guess.",

        "comments": "This review is specifically for the Magic Brownie shade, as I have not tested the others. \n\nThe Pros: \n\nThe packaging is unique and fits well in a pocket because of the flat, rectangular design. Magic Brownie applies as a beautiful pink/brown nude, is quite glossy and has relatively comfortable small glitter particles.\n\nThe Cons:\n\nFor the price point, the packaging does feel on the cheap side - specifically the applicator wand. The doe foot is very small (which some may like), but the wand itself feels fragile - as though time or pressure will cause it to break. The formula, while nice, also does not quite match the price point, but is not sticky (at least for this color).\n\nI would recommend buying it only if it's on sale.",

        "comments": "I have been wanting a black lip gloss and the sparkle is so pretty. But I was very disappointed in this product. First, the formula is SO sticky. If a stray hair accidentally touches it, it's like glued to your lips. Second, the color is not at all like what is shown in the product photos. I am pale and it goes on light gray. If you layer more on for a deeper color, it settles in the creases of your lips and just looks patchy. And third, you cannot wear lip liner with it! This product erases any other lip product you try to pair with it. I wanted to love it but it's one of my most regretful beauty purchases of the past year - especially at this price.",

The glitter actually looks like specs of glitter, and not a frost lip look some \"glitter\" glosses have. The only issue i have is that when I eat or drink. The glitter in the gloss, if it makes it in your mouth. Feels like you have small flecks of sand in your mouth. It's barable and i feel like everything else is good. So, if you can get pass that for the look i'd reccomend it.",

It dries down a bit and smooths out. As long as you buy this knowning what texture glitter has you will be fine. This is not a lip oil. The color lasts a decent amount of time for a gloss. \n\nThe size of the product is good too.

It's seriously such a vibe I got so many compliments. I love pairing it with my half magic lip liner as pictured. It's completely worth the price. I am going to stock up on the test ic the shades I can't wait to review more products! It doesn't leave your lips sticky or dry and it's such a classy yet bold look. Definitely makes a statement ladies.",

        "comments": "Love the unique name. Definitely caught my attention. The Frosty B*tch shade is a beautiful, shimmery color that provides a nice frosty sheen when applied. It gives a subtle and somewhat icy look, which is perfect for certain occasions or when you want to make a statement.The lip gloss is relatively easy to apply, and it has a pleasant, non-sticky texture. I appreciate that it doesn't feel heavy on the lips, and it does offer some hydration.However, there are a few downsides that kept me from giving it a higher rating. One, the staying power is not the best. I found myself needing to reapply it more frequently than I'd like, especially after eating or drinking. Additionally, the color payoff isn't as intense as I expected. It's more of a sheer gloss, so if you're looking for bold color, this might not be your best choice.",
