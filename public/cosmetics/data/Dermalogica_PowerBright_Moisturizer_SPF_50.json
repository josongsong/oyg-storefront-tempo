I've been using this one for 2 weeks now and I've seen a huge difference in my skin tone! The dark spots on my cheeks are completely gone and the ones on my forehead are fading. It goes on great underneath the Skin perfect primer. I've used other sunscreen moisturizers before and they are always very shiny and greasy looking even after putting on make up. This one doesn't have that effect and it makes my skin glow!",

It was the best moisturizer and make up base for me and had mattifying effect for my oily skin like any other product i have tryed. The new formula is too oily and my pores look way bigger than before. I wish both formulas are available so people can choose depending on their skin type to have this moisturizer with all the other benefits that they like in this cream. Will not buy the new one and deffinetly have to find a new brand wich offers that mattifying effect.",
