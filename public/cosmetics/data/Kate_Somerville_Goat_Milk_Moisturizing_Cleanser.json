        "comments": "I had my eyes on this cleanser for a few months and when the time came around to purchase a new cleanser I was so excited to finally try this. The ingredient makeup seemed like it was going to be ideal for my skin. The consistency of this is more comparable to a gel cleanser than a milk cleanser in my opinion. That being said; it acted like a gel cleanser as well. I gave it multiple tries; but it left my skin stripped (like the post-castile soap tight/dry feeling) so I ended up returning. That alone is enough to make me run for the hills; but if you have any sort of sensitivies to fragrance beware this is an incredibly fragranced product; due to this I experience some sensitivity near the eye area (obviously not in or on my eye). Steer clear if you like having a moisture barrier!",

It never leaves me feeling stripped, it's so creamy and my skin feels so clean and moisturized after. I love the subtle, natural smell to it. I love when I get to use it and look forward to it. The beautiful thing is that Ulta frequently has it on sale… it's not always loud so be on watch. I now have two bottles in back stock since I've purchased my first and I have yet to pay full price. Stock up on sale, girlies. TRY on sale - so worth it. We've been lucky but I'd pay full price for this, easy.",

At 33, I had yet yo gind a cleanser that didnt leave most of my skin with that tight, stripped feeling- or not clean at all. This is it!! After a couple pf weeks. I can safely say I'll never buy another cleanser as this exists. Its worth the price to finally have something that works on my whole face, not just my t zone or just my cheeks. My forehead and cheeks get super dry, I have oily acne prone nose- but this helped with it all. Hydrating for cheeks and forehead, but cleansing enough for my nose. Very little goes a long way too!

The old one separated and hardened into globs that resembled hardened honey making it difficult to get out of the tube. It was also very balm like bordering on greasy. This version  is white and fluffy; hydrating  but not oily. It rinses off nicely. I have very dry skin but think anyone could use this. It has much better mass appeal that the original formula which I would not have repurchased. I would still double cleanse if wearing a full face of makeup but one cleanse with this is perfect for a morning cleanse or a minimal makeup evening cleanse. It's very pleasant to use and I'm glad I had another opportunity to try it. It leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.",

The ingredient makeup seemed like it was going to be ideal for my skin. The consistency of this is more comparable to a gel cleanser than a milk cleanser in my opinion. That being said; it acted like a gel cleanser as well. I gave it multiple tries; but it left my skin stripped (like the post-castile soap tight/dry feeling) so I ended up returning. That alone is enough to make me run for the hills; but if you have any sort of sensitivies to fragrance beware this is an incredibly fragranced product; due to this I experience some sensitivity near the eye area (obviously not in or on my eye). Steer clear if you like having a moisture barrier!",
