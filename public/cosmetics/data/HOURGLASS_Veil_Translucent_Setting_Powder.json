I use the translucent shade to lightly set my liquid foundation (either Jones Road WTF or NARS light reflecting) or use on my tzone when just wearing sunscreen. It doesnt take much but I'm only using powder to reduce shine not necessarily to \"lock\" anything in place. Feels weightless and doesn't break me out. Worth the price.",

It is perfectly balanced!  The design of the packaging is very thought-out and looks luxurious.  Hourglass really knocked the ball out of the park with this setting powder.  The only con I would mention is that for the price, there maybe could be a little more product if you want to compare it to others in the same price range, but you would also need a less of this product to get the job done so that is also something to take into consideration.  A little does go a lot further with this powder compared to others on the market.",

        "comments": "Ok so to start, I am 40. And while I'm pretty fortunate to not be riddled with wrinkles, I have a few fine lines. And noticing no matter what powder I try it settles into the creases so bad. And I have tried some amazing powders. Smashbox halo, Kim chi, Bobbi Brown. All of these are amazing products. But maybe not so much for mature skin. Which I'm not all the way there, but I definitely don't want a product that accentuates my fine lines. ￼I saw a review of this product on Flip. It looked awesome. But again I figured it would just end up like the other ones, but then I was in store I saw it. I tried it on the back of my hand, which has more fine lines than my face will ever have. ￼ And I was so impressed I bought it. Tried it this morning and WOW. It's so fine that it does not accentuate fine lines. This is an amazing product and my very first hourglass product. And a forever staple in my makeup arsenal! OBSESSED!!!! \n\nI do see reviews saying that they wish there was more product in there, but when I look at all of the other powders that I have it at has the same amount, so people might be referencing the travel size versus the full size.",
