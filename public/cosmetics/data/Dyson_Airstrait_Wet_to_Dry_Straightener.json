To make matters worse, Dyson's customer service has been unhelpful and dismissive—I couldn't even get proper support for the issue. Save your money and protect your hair.",

If I want to dry it and straighten it, its going to take over an hour. I saw people saying this is way faster, so i gave it a try. I used it right after a shower (so it hadnt even air dried at all) and it took 30 minutes! It makes my hair look so smooth and silky too. I love it and feel like its well worth the money for the time saved by it.",

I had a Dyson hair dryer for 5-6 years until it broke and have been using one of those hair brush dryers but this- this is fantastic!  It dries my hair and leaves it stick straight with no frizz and it'll stay styled like that until I wash my hair. It usually wait until my hair is 75-80% dry and then do a quick rough dry at the roots, then go in. I pass it through each section 3-4 times then i have beautifully dried, straightened hair!  This was definitely a great investment and i highly recommend",

I can use this as a blow dryer to get it almost dry and start straightening, or use it on completely dry hair. The cool shot feature really is the star of the show, you can see a difference immediately when using it and how shiny the hair is after. I would say the noise is pretty loud, and it's kind of a bulky product. My hair doesn't stay as straight when using it as opposed to a standard hair straightener, but it saves me time, and looks more sleek.",

There are tricks to making this work on frizzy, stubborn hair, and i dont think the negative reviews tried very hard honestly. It takes a couple passes to dry and there is frizz after the wet to dry setting, using the dry setting smooths the hair after its dry, and using the cool air sets it for days! \n\nAll i did was watch some youtube videos to learn this and am so grateful that this exists!

But I still turn yellow.  In reading about the Dyson Airstrait Straightner, I am hoping since it doesn't have the direct heat, it will help with the yellow situation.

I wil usually use it on damp hair, after letting it air dry for a bit after the shower. It takes me 5-10 minutes. Sometimes I'll use it on dry hair and it is even faster! I only use it twice a week, if that, for the past year and I haven't noticed any form of damage. I do recommend it to others who would like to cut styling time.",

The style is straight, there is no using this product to create waves. If you are ok with the stick straight look, saving time and dropping a significant amount of money on a one trick pony, this is for you. If you need more from a styler besides straightening and time saving, you might want to consider something else. This fills my need and I appreciate the time savings, but the cost is pretty extreme. I took away one star for the price tag.",

I finally got one and my only regret is that i didnt buy it sooner! \nThere is a learning curve, it took me 45 minutes when i first got it, but now im down to 20 minutes from wet to straight! \nI have long, fine curly/wavy hair. I section it and with 2 passes it is dry, sleek, and smooth. Better results than using a straightener. My only issue is that it can not get all the way up to the roots, so i lock it and dry the roots with the dryer part and then go over it. Its not a problem for me because my roots are straight, but i could see it being a problem if you have curly roots. \nI know Dyson claims no damage, but this thing gets hot enough that you cant touch your hair, so im a little sceptical about that claim. However, before using this ( when i was using a regular straightener) I would have a handful of haor come out in the shower and now its only a frw strands and my hair just feels healthier. So i definitely think its better than using a straightener. \nIt leaves my hair so sleek, smooth, soft, and oin straight. The results last for days too! If you are lije me and on the fence about dropping the money for this hair tool…. Do it! Its amazing and worth every penny! Total game changer!!!",

I set the setting for low (again blonde!) and it takes no time to dry my hair. It comes out super smooth and straight. Id be lost without it! I havent had a problem with it drying out my hair but I follow a pretty strict routine with products that serve my blonde hair. This hair dryer/straightner is perfect! Worth the investment!",

Until this purchase I was a total dyson supporter with many items ....now I won't ever again!",
