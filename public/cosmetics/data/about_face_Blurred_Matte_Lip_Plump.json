When I put on true red, it should not be the color of a blackberry. Also no plump just soft extremely smearable gunk. If you want plum go w buxom. If you have dark to black skin you might like this product because they are extremely dark and saturated, but still thick and smeary so I really don't recommend you try it. I mean I have a lot of buxom matte plumps, shine plumps, too faced, and my whole box is filled w my glosses , lipsticks, plumper, colors, matte plumbers . My favorites are buxom and I shouldn't say it on here but JEFFree Starr. Love his lipsticks . Love! Nothing like them on earth. I only wear shades or red btw. Buxom has some great plumper reds I wear them very often. I even got some random liquid lip stuff on here I love. This is going back and I rarely return lipsticks eps red it's not red it's black omg",

Most surprising is the beautiful stain it wears off to or can be blotted to; it creates that blurry lip look I never could achieve before… and it also doesn't get crumbly like matte lippies can. I got Kismet, a peachy color that's not too orange, brown or nude. Also Petit Rouge, a cool cherry red that can be blotted to a gorgeous stain. Kismet is my favorite as it's rather unique.",

I also swatched Side-Eye in store, but it basically looked orange on my skin tone. Give us more, please!",

It lasts all day and really blurs the lips. There is a slight tingling sensation when you first put the product on but it isnt overwhelming in any way and goes away over time. I got one shade to try and went back the next week to get two more. 10/10 recommend! (Also pairs great with their lip gloss)",

As the formula wears in, it leaves a subtle tint that lasts, making it the perfect low-maintenance lip product.\n\nFrom a plumping perspective, it gives a very light plump, nowhere near the intensity of the Too Faced glosses (which I personally love). If you're more on the sensitive side, I think you'd really enjoy this one!\n\nFor application, I lightly dot it on my lips and then tap it in with my finger. It helps diffuse the formula, giving a natural, lived-in look.",
