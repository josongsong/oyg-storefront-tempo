        "comments": "[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] The Fwee Lip&Cheek Blurry Pudding Pot is a playful and intriguing addition to any makeup collection. The compact pot already promises a multitasking vibe, merging lip color and cheek tint in a single, convenient product. The packaging is charmingly quirky, with a soft pastel aesthetic that feels both modern and whimsical. The texture is creamy yet lightweight, gliding smoothly onto lips and cheeks without dragging or pulling. On the lips, the shade delivers a comfortable, satin finish that looks natural and slightly juicy, never overly glossy. On the cheeks, the product blends out into a dewy flush that lifts the complexion with a healthy glow. The color payoff is buildable, allowing for sheer everyday polish or a deeper, statement look with more layers. The Blurry Pudding Pot excels at blending, thanks to its cushiony consistency that shears away harsh lines. It performs well across skin tones, offering versatility for fair to medium and deeper complexions with flattering warmth. The scent is subtle and sweet, enhancing the application experience without clashing with fragrance sensitivities. Longevity is reasonably good for a creamy hybrid, typically wearing several hours on lips with minimal feathering and a soft fade on cheeks. The formulation feels comfortable for extended wear, not drying out the lips or emphasizing fine lines. A key strength is its dual-use design, reducing clutter while encouraging a cohesive makeup look. The pigmentation on cheeks translates into a natural, sun-kissed glow that can be built up for more intensity. On lips, the color sits comfortably without settling into lip lines, maintaining a smooth surface. The creaminess helps it blur minor imperfections rather than accentuate them. The product is easy to apply straight from the pot or with fingers for a quick, low-effort routine. A small, precise dab goes a long way, making precise lip lining or blush placement unnecessary in many cases. The packaging is sturdy enough for travel, with a secure lid that travels well in a makeup bag. While some might prefer separate components for lips and cheeks, the blended versatility is precisely what makes this pot appealing. Overall, the Fwee Lip&Cheek Blurry Pudding Pot delivers a charming, multifunctional performance that's delightful to use and easy to incorporate into everyday looks.",

As someone who loves the look of matte lipstick but hates how it dries my lips into a wrinkly mess, this product is a game-changer. The texture is unlike anything I've tried—it's fluffy, almost mousse-like, and surprisingly moisturizing. It gives that soft matte finish without the dreaded dryness or flakiness.\nWhat really stands out is its versatility. Not only does it make my lips look smooth and blurred, but it also gives my cheeks a gorgeous, natural pop of color. It blends effortlessly and feels weightless on the skin. I love that I can toss one product in my bag and use it for both lips and cheeks—perfect for quick touch-ups or minimalist makeup days.\nIf you're looking for a multi-use product that delivers a matte look without compromising comfort, this little pot of pudding might just be your new favorite.",

Also, it is blurring (it would be a great option for someone with larger pores like me), it has a soft and effortless finish, looks natural, but buildable. The formula is lightweight, and it blends really well, and it does have that filter effect.

Its a fluffy mousse like texture with a matte finish, that can be buildable. It's versatile as it can be applied to the cheeks, as well to add some warnth. I love K-beauty skin care products, but honestly this lip product didn't do it for me. When applying I patted my lips inward, but a lip brush can also be used. I really couldn't tell I had it on my lips, as it gives a natural finish. Unfortunately it dryed out my lips, and a lip gloss applied on top would prevent them drying out. and it wouldn't dry out your lips. I didnt notice a blurry effect, but just nude stain to my lips. I don't think it's highly pigmented either. If your looking for a subtle shade for your cheeks, and a light stain for your lips I would recommend applying a nice lip gloss on top.",

I would suggest white for the words it would be easier to read and not blend in with the peachy color of the box. Now with all that being said- this blurring pudding actually works very well and goes on super easy. It smells very lightly of a good lippy. The glass base that the pudding is in is absolutely beautiful.",

        "comments": "[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] The Fwee Lip&Cheek Blurry Pudding Pot is a playful and intriguing addition to any makeup collection. The compact pot already promises a multitasking vibe, merging lip color and cheek tint in a single, convenient product. The packaging is charmingly quirky, with a soft pastel aesthetic that feels both modern and whimsical. The texture is creamy yet lightweight, gliding smoothly onto lips and cheeks without dragging or pulling. On the lips, the shade delivers a comfortable, satin finish that looks natural and slightly juicy, never overly glossy. On the cheeks, the product blends out into a dewy flush that lifts the complexion with a healthy glow. The color payoff is buildable, allowing for sheer everyday polish or a deeper, statement look with more layers. The Blurry Pudding Pot excels at blending, thanks to its cushiony consistency that shears away harsh lines. It performs well across skin tones, offering versatility for fair to medium and deeper complexions with flattering warmth. The scent is subtle and sweet, enhancing the application experience without clashing with fragrance sensitivities. Longevity is reasonably good for a creamy hybrid, typically wearing several hours on lips with minimal feathering and a soft fade on cheeks. The formulation feels comfortable for extended wear, not drying out the lips or emphasizing fine lines. A key strength is its dual-use design, reducing clutter while encouraging a cohesive makeup look. The pigmentation on cheeks translates into a natural, sun-kissed glow that can be built up for more intensity. On lips, the color sits comfortably without settling into lip lines, maintaining a smooth surface. The creaminess helps it blur minor imperfections rather than accentuate them. The product is easy to apply straight from the pot or with fingers for a quick, low-effort routine. A small, precise dab goes a long way, making precise lip lining or blush placement unnecessary in many cases. The packaging is sturdy enough for travel, with a secure lid that travels well in a makeup bag. While some might prefer separate components for lips and cheeks, the blended versatility is precisely what makes this pot appealing. Overall, the Fwee Lip&Cheek Blurry Pudding Pot delivers a charming, multifunctional performance that's delightful to use and easy to incorporate into everyday looks.",

        "comments": "[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] The fwee lip&cheek Blurring pudding pot #ND04 called \"My\" is a soft rose shade that is very subtle. Its a fluffy mousse like texture with a matte finish, that can be buildable. It's versatile as it can be applied to the cheeks, as well to add some warnth. I love K-beauty skin care products, but honestly this lip product didn't do it for me. When applying I patted my lips inward, but a lip brush can also be used. I really couldn't tell I had it on my lips, as it gives a natural finish. Unfortunately it dryed out my lips, and a lip gloss applied on top would prevent them drying out. and it wouldn't dry out your lips. I didnt notice a blurry effect, but just nude stain to my lips. I don't think it's highly pigmented either. If your looking for a subtle shade for your cheeks, and a light stain for your lips I would recommend applying a nice lip gloss on top.",
