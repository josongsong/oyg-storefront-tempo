I picked this up after doing some research and after one use my skin feels plump and hydrated! I have extremely fair and sensitive skin with alot of redness on my face and this product did not itritate my skin in the slightest. I applied after using La Roche Posay's gentle face wash for normal to oily skin and the difference I feel after this combo is insane.

This product when used regularly produced a significant difference in the visuals, touch, and feeling of my skin. It wasn't heavy and buttery like most lotions, but more of a balm that, sunk into your skin and left no residue. Just beautiful glowing skin! The product is odorless, leaves no smudges on leather car seats and overall does a wonderful job. I am so happy to finally see this lifelong struggle fade away, as I embrace healthy skin! I received this product complimentary courtesy of influenster, but the product has truly won me over to La Roche-Posay alone!",

I've tried La Roche Posay products before, so I was under the assumption this would be another worthwhile purchase. I bought this product two days ago and both times I've used it (immediately after washing my face), it's made my skin itchy, inflamed, and red. This evening, after applying it, my skin got so itchy and red I thought I was having an allergic reaction to my sheets or to one of my makeup brushes/products, but as soon as I washed my face again, the itchiness went away. I only thought to wash my face after reading a review of someone who experienced something similar to what I did. I was even about to take allergy medicine and apply cortisone to perhaps help with the itchiness and discomfort. I would NOT recommend this product whatsoever.",
