I love that there is no scent, or if there is one it's so faint that it's not noticeable to me. It has a silky texture, and it definitely provides moisture. A little goes a long way, which is saying a lot for my dry cheeks. My skin breaks out easily so i was pleasantly surprised when this actually improved the texture of my skin. I've been a fan of kopari for a while now & they didn't fail to produce a great product, yet again. Ive officially added this to my skincare routine. Also, vegan… yay!",

It is thick and essential oil free ingredients are great-ceramides,cholesterol and fatty acids needed for barrier repair. But the percentage of fatty oils in this is so much immediately on application it looks like I put a thick oil on my face. Some creams have a way around this by not rubbing in a lot after applying then they don't melt down so shiny but this one was literally impossible. I have crazy dry skin as well and this was a huge disappointment for me. Something comparable but NOT oily that I got is the summer Fridays cloud cream. That one is 100x better and around the same price. \nIn a bind if my skin is super impaired I may try it again, or in the winter but I don't see this not being too greasy. I use mainly Korean moisturizers that are meant to do the same tbing for 1/4th the price and perform like they are decades ahead of this. Just no",
