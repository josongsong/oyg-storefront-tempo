I think the packaging is cute and effective at dispensing in the smaller size bottle. I have emptied more bottles of this than I can count and I will continue to buy!\n\nThe only con is that it does not cut through heavier makeup very well for me, which is fine because I tend to use it as a light cleanser anyways.",

That's not a compliment on my type of skin because it means my face was oily. I learned my lesson.
