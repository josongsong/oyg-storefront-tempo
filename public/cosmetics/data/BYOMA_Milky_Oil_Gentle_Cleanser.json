No eye residue or stinging, doesn't break me out, and smells mildy of rosmary oil as its used as an antioxidant in the formula.",

I get psoriasis patches (mild thankfully), I am acne prone, my skin is getting dryer as I get older, and I have sensitive skin on top of all of this. This keeps my skin clear without drying it out. I do use other products to keep acne away and a really good moisturizer as well but anyway, I like the way my face feels after I've rinsed this off. It makes my face feel really soft and clean. I was worried at first because oil isn't really your best friend if you are acne prone but I can't use a lot of face washes that combat acne because they eventually will dry me out and then the psoriasis patches pop up. This shockingly does not make me break out, my face is really clear, it does not make me look shiny/oily, and it just gently cleanses my face. I have strayed from this face wash before to try others and I can confirm this is the best one for me and I don't think I'll be using any other face wash ever again after trying out other products and comparing them to this one. This face wash is awesome!!!!",

I do follow up with the milky moisture cleanser after just to make sure it's all off my skin. I dont feel stripped or dry after. I wouldnt use it twice a day (I justbuse the milky moisture cleanser in the morning). \n\nWill be repurchasing - the bottle is about hapfway through after a month of nightly use.",

La roche broke me out BAD, so i switched to this, and i dont have any abnormal breakouts from it but… it doesnt really clear out my pores like oil cleansers are meant to, even when used as instructed. Itll get a few bits out every use, but leaves majority of my blackheads untouched.\n\nOverall, i think its a good, affordable option for people learning how to oil cleanse. Maybe my pores just need something more extreme. It didnt no me any harm, but it hasnt done me any benefit either.",

Rinses clean 100% and doesnt leave skin dry or tight, or oily. Im a fan of the whole line but this is by far my favorite product. Holy grail. Excellent!",

        "comments": "Gifted by BYOMA. The Milky Oil Cleanser has been a total game-changer in my skincare routine. From the first use, I was impressed with how effortlessly it melted away makeup, sunscreen, and daily grime. The texture is incredibly lightweight and smooth, feeling luxurious as it glides over my skin. It transforms into a silky, milky consistency when rinsed with water, leaving my skin feeling fresh, clean, and hydrated without any greasy residue. I especially love how gentle it is—my skin tends to be sensitive, but this cleanser leaves it feeling soft and balanced with no irritation or tightness. After just a few days of use, my skin looked noticeably clearer and brighter, with an overall more even complexion. Plus, it's packed with skin-friendly ingredients that support my skin barrier, which is a big bonus. I love using this as the first step in my double-cleansing routine, and it works perfectly with my other skincare products. The Milky Oil Cleanser has quickly become one of my favorite daily essentials. If you're looking for a cleanser that's both effective and gentle, I highly recommend giving this one a try—you won't be disappointed!",

Due to all the horror stories i had seen about allergic reactions/ red \"dots\" (?), and other scary reactions, i was really apprehensive. I tried the cleanser on to clean my makeup off & at first i did like it (even got over the flowery oil scent) because it did seem to lift my face makeup off (was too scared to go in on y eyes). Then about 5-10 mins later i noticed my face  (cheeks/ forehead) was getting slightly red (which has never happened with a cleanser). I also\nnoticed that my skin felt \"tight\" and dry. After my face got a bit more red…  i started to freak out so i used my la roche posay cleanser to wash this cleanser off lol. WHILE IM WASHING THIS OFF- on one side of my face/ one cheek- it STUNG!!! I think its safe to say i'll be retuning this and will go back to being on the hunt for a good oil cleanser.",
