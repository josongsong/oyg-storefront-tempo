I have very fine, thin hair and it goes flat almost as soon as I leave the bathroom without a styling gel. This gel is the perfect formula for giving my hair volume without weighing it down. It isn't sticky so I can blow dry my hair pulling and breakage. All of you who have fine, thin hair know what I'm talking about! Try it! It must be good, because I often have trouble finding it, but Ulta usually has at least one bottle on the shelf when I shop there. I have recommended this product to many of my friends with hair like mine.",
