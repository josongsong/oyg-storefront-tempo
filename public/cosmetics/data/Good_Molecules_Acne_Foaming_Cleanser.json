I have had multiple people give me compliments on my face who have seen me before and after using this product, my acne would hurt by just touching it and i would even get cystic acne and now my face is so bright and clear. I still can't believe it. The one thing I will say is that my face had to get used to the product because it used to be pretty red for a few minutes after I washed it, but no more redness.",

For the longest time I did not want to give\n up my OG cleanser but it wasnt working for me anymore. I read the reviews of this cleanser and noticed for most people it was a hit or miss, but it seemed to work for people with an oily combination acne prone skin type, which is what I have. So I took the chance and bought it and im here to second that!! I had bumps all over my forehead and consistant breakouts on my chin and after using this product i noticed quick results. After about a month my forehead is completely smooth, my skin tends fo be significantly less oily, and my breakouts are less consistant. I love this stuff!!!!",

Salicylic is a exfoliant if your face feels dry thats because its removing the dead skin and debris, thats normal. I like to use a gentle cleanser in am and my salicylic in pm. Also remember to wear your spf while on this cleanser, since this bha will increase your skin sensitivity to the sun. :) 10/10",

        "comments": "I have issues with hyper pigmentation and in grown hairs around my chin. As a woman of color been suffering with skin issues since I was a baby. It is embarrassing for a woman in her 40s to have acne like a teenager. I have tried products lgot some results over a long period of time, but cannot afford their high prices being on a budget. I noticed after one week of using the serum it appeared my skin was clearing but there were still bumpd. Then something weird happened, I had never before experienced. The bumps on my face started to dry out and harden. Like it kind of hurt a little bit only on the bumps that were drying. I washed my face felt a small tug. Look on my finger and it was a very long hair wrapped in dried skin. The serum worked 💪&#55356; to heal my skin to the point where it pushed out a half inch ingrown hair culprit, while I was washing my face. Ingrown hairs HURT and are irritating. After that it left behind smooth clear skin in the once infected area. I will be a repeat customer and will refer others to try the product. It's amazing and I did not have high hopes at all.",

        "comments": "I've used many products with salicylic acid in the past, but this is the only one that has ever given me a bad reaction. My face started to feel hot within seconds of putting this product on then started to burn. I rinsed the foam off in what was probably less than 10 seconds hoping that would stop the hot sensation on my face. The feeling didn't go away and actually began burning after a minute. The discomfort this product caused lingered for about half an hour even after applying some aloe to soothe the burning. I have somewhat sensitive skin so I figured the product just wasn't meant for my kind of skin and gave it to my sister. Her skin is \"normal\" and she had the same thing happen to her. This was a disappointing product after having read so many good reviews. This may work for many people, but I've never had such a bad reaction to a product, even with my sensitive skin, so I would proceed with caution when buying this.",
