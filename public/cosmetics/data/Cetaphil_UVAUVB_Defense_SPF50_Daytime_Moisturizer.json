First, the sunscreen just sticks to your skin and is just made of chemicals. If you workout or exercise and sweat, the sunscreen sticks to your eyeballs for at least an hour. No matter how much you wash your eyes, it just stays. I am disappointed. I spent 1 hour trying to get the crap out of my red eyes, and I wasted so much time. My family is angry at me. So instead, I would consider Blue Lizard sunscreen, as they have minerals instead of chemicals. I recommend not getting this piece of garbage at all.",

It's leaves a \"dewey\" finish on the skin without makeup, which also isn't what us oily gals want at all. It's going back to Ulta",

However, this sunscreen smells fishy and is thick when you first apply it and immediately leaves a white cast, and you have to continue to rub it in to make the white cast fade away. It's also sticky and heavy and irritates the eyes. Then end up with a shiny face feeling greasy. I have dry skin and if it did that to me, I can't imagine somebody with oily or combination skin.",
