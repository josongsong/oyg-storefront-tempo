        "comments": "I've used other tinted moisturizers with sunscreen that have more pigmented colors that actually look like foundation and cover imperfections. I would say this doesn't look at all like I'm wearing foundation and doesn't cover any of my sunspots, but it also doesn't have a white cast on my medium tan skin. I've been using it daily for a couple of weeks and it also doesn't make little crumbly bits all over my face like some primers do. For my 47 year old skin this works perfectly so I will continue to use it and I'm going to try to get my teen daughter to wear it too; she hates makeup so hopefully the fact that this doesn't add color should check the right boxes for her. I'm also going to add that we both have eczema and Clinique is the one brand that doesn't cause flares that we can both use.",

It is on the thicker side but it spreads nicely and doesnt pill when paired with clinique moisture surge 100H or peach and lily's matcha moisturizer (my two HG moisturizers). You need your moisturizer to dry for 15 minutes and THEN apply your spf, this dramatically reduces it from pilling. It does look very orange when dispensed but it gives me a great sheer tint that looks like I put makeup on, its beautiful! So I wear alone typically on non-makeup days but does work very well as a primer as well (I use IT cosmetics CC+ foundation in light warm medium. For reference, I am also WN04 Bone in Clinique even better makeup so light/med and the tint works great for me. Wish it came in a bigger bottle! As it is pricy when you apply the standard 1/4tsp.",

I tried Black Girl Sunscreen and it was too oily . . . I could never seem to get my hands on the matte version.\nIn comes Clinique. I think having never tried their previous sunscreen helped. Note: I am in the habit of mixing my moisturizer (Dramatically Different Gel) with this product and it spreads and absorbs well. Though this is heavier than my previous sunscreen, it does not feel heavy once it dries. This wore well and protected my skin through all of my outdoor playtime in Jamaica!",

But for real, I would always be willing to pay 3x as much as other facial screen suns for Clinique's because I just loved it that much. I wear it daily before applying any kind of makeup and it made just as a fantastic base as a sunscreen.\n\nSo, this new product...I've been fortunate enough in life to have avoided any \"products I LOVED replaced by a new product that I don't love\"; until now. I don't hate the product and I'm still going to buy/use it. I did consider dropping to the sheer 25SPF, but as a pasty ginger, I want the higher spf. The formula doesn't seem to flawlessly spread as easily, it feels thicker, stickier and overall, I would give anything for the old product. I don't need a tint in my sunscreen because I do wear other makeup on top of it, so this just seems like overkill. \n\nHowever, I'd still recommend it to friends because I love Clinique products in general and it's difficult to find products that contain the things I want and the things I need - specifically complete fragrance free. I still pass for a solid ten years younger than I really am, which I constantly give credit to my daily sunscreen use. I'm still going to forever miss the old product though.",
