        "comments": "I have used this product ever since it came out on the market and has really worked for me. It has made significant change to my eyes getting rid of the dark circles and giving a bright glow to the eye in general.  Has diminished the look of the crows feet on the side eye.  I like the way the eye looks after massaging it alongside the Foreo Iris, they sure complement each other.  \nSadly I received an expired product from Ulta in mid- February.  I recently finished my previous product.  When I opened the new  one it had a weird color and odd smell. Not until i actually saw the bottom that I noticed that the expiration date was from 2 years ago !!! Definately check the expiration dates ;/",

So I had really high hopes for this eye cream but unfortunately I wasted 40 bucks! It does not rub or pat into the skin at all, it simply moves all around my eyes with little to no absorption, I have to assume a little must soak it hours after I go to bed, But in the AM I can't wait hours to do my routine so I don't use in the morning anymore. Also the twist brush dispenser wastes product, I do NOT over twist and use all the product on the brush but every time when I use it again it has dried up cream inside and the top of the brush. I have stored it standing up right, laying down but it oozes out when I'm done and put the cover back on.",
