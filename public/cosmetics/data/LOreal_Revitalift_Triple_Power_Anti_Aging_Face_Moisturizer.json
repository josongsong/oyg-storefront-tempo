But I also don't use the other two recommended products for maximum effect. Sadly the price point will prevent me from continuing use after this jar. Also after maybe three weeks, I started getting very large pimples on my face and neck. Mid-40s is too old to be dealing with that. So obviously it's too heavy for my skin.",

Just hope it improves my skin to prevent some new ones. The only thing I didn't like is the jar that you dip into. I prefer a pump. I think pumps are more sanitary.

It comes nicely packaged in a glass jar ( very impressed by that) It has a pretty heavy sunscreen scent which doesn't bother me. \nThe product is creamy, and upon application soaks right in without leaving greasiness or a white cast from the sunscreen. The skin on my neck felt softer right away which blows me away. The wrinkles on my forehead seem to not look as harsh after only a few days of use. Let this be a lesson to us all that we don't have to break the bank to find a good skin care product that shows up and does what they say it will do! If I could change anything, I could do without the sunscreen scent. \n* user tip- Put on after your shower to help the HA lock in additional moisture. \n* I received this product complimentary for reviewing purposes.",

I am 75 years old this year, and I was experiencing some loss of integrity of my skin on my face. I know! It's expected at my age, but I am a youthful-looking person and I was so disappointed to see that! This moisturizer has really helped that. I don't mind some of the wrinkles - goes with the territory, right? But this helps so much and I am grateful to have found it.",

This ends up causing me to appear to have a skin condition or dandruff when, in truth, I only have plain dry skin. LOVE the product! But is this reaction normal? Thanks for any tips.",
