The masks are easier to spread, and since nothing actually sticks to the wand, it's so easy to clean off what little mask is left.\n\nI alternate between face cloths and an Foreo device, but I sometimes forget to put the Foreo back in the shower (first world problems, I know). Now I keep that in the shower, and I can keep this at my sink. I feel like my face is just ask clean when I use this wand. \n\nI think it's a good investment for the price. Two in one. Worth it.",
