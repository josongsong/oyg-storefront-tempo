Plus, once you get in the shower, it reveals the missed make up the wipe didn't take off :/. I'll be returning tomorrow..",

I'm a bit picky when it comes to makeup wipes, I have sensitive combination skin and it can be difficult to find products that work without ruining my skin.  I love everything about these!  They're soft, the smell is delicate, and they really get the job done.  I was impressed with how much makeup they removed.  It usually only takes 1 wipe to take my makeup off, and then I wash my face afterwards to really get my pores clean.  These have been great, they don't burn my face, and don't make me break out.  Will absolutely purchase again!",

This also contains chemicals such as phthalates, triclosan, and parabens, which are known to be endocrine disruptors, plus other ingredients like fragrances that can irritate the skin. In addition to being harmful to your own personal health. If you are looking for something to take off your makeup at the end of the day, opt for Banila Co's Clean it Zero cleansing balm. I promise you, oil cleansing is just a step up from make up wipes. You'll love the sherbet texture of a cleansing balm.",
