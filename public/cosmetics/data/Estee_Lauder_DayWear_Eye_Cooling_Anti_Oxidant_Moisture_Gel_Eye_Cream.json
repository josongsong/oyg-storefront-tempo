I could not imagine paying full price for it. I am 35 with a little bit of puffiness and dark circles from being a tired working mom. After two months of using this, I still have puffiness and dark circles. Nothing's changed. I do not feel like cooling sensation either. And if your eyes water while it's on and it gets in your eye at all it burns - it does not absorb very well. I wouldn't ever buy this again.",
