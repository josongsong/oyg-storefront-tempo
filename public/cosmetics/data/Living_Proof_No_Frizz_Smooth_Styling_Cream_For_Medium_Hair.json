It worked wonderfully and gave me nice curls. Also has no heavy fragrance as other brands do. It feels light and weightless.",

It is no longer like a classy gel (the old formula would hold my hair back all day without flyaways, like a gel without the residue of a gel, and would leave my hair soft and \"nourish[ed]\" like the old version name \"nourishing\" when I would let my hair down after work). This new version is a flop and leaves my hair feeling and looking greasy. It does nothing to \"smooth\" it out. It no longer holds it back. I wish I would have tried it sooner so that I could have returned it. Living Proof, why mess with a good thing? Please bring back the old formula. That was my friend in the morning to keep my hair calm, and it gave me confidence at work. Please bring back my friend.",

I never want to be without this product, and so I was thrilled when this favorite product was gifted by Living Proof. The results for me— smooth, shiny, frizz free hair that is manageable and looks great! I have long, thick, naturally curly hair that I straighten. Most products do not properly support a great blowout for me— they're too heavy, greasy, or just make my hair curl up again. The Living Proof Smooth Styling Cream is amazing. Lightweight, nourishing, and my secret for the perfect and easy blowout. \n\nI add a small amount to damp, combed through hair, and then I add a bit more to each section before heat drying. I focus on ends to roots, using less near the top. Surprisingly, only a small amount is needed, even for my long, thick hair. My hair dries easier, smoother, and it is frizz free. This cream blocks humidity and it has a built-in heat protectant, so I can feel better about heat styling. As with other Living Proof products, this cream is actually good for your overall hair health— it's free of silicones, parabens, sulfates, etc. I can honestly say that my hair has been transformed since I started using Living Proof products a few years back, especially this one. It is pricey, but it lasts a while and it works wonders!!!",

        "comments": "I bought this over the summer to try when my stash of the old formula ran out. I am beyond disappointed. This new formula is like lotion for the hair. It is no longer like a classy gel (the old formula would hold my hair back all day without flyaways, like a gel without the residue of a gel, and would leave my hair soft and \"nourish[ed]\" like the old version name \"nourishing\" when I would let my hair down after work). This new version is a flop and leaves my hair feeling and looking greasy. It does nothing to \"smooth\" it out. It no longer holds it back. I wish I would have tried it sooner so that I could have returned it. Living Proof, why mess with a good thing? Please bring back the old formula. That was my friend in the morning to keep my hair calm, and it gave me confidence at work. Please bring back my friend.",
