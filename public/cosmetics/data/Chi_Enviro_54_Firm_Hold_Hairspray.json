My only complaint is, like with many other CHI products, the nozzle gets clogged or something and either stops working or the hairspray shoots out in crazy directions. CHI REALLY needs to work on the sprayer design of all of their bottles. I would say 90% of the CHI products I have gotten the sprayer has messed up on them and well before the bottle was empty so wasted product and money.",

My husband complains about the smell every time I use it, which he never did before it was \"improved\".  The hold is firmer than it used to be.  Almost like the helmet head product by Chi.   I'm so disappointed because now I have to begin the search for another hairspray.",
