I even got a compliment the other day on how beautiful and shiny my hair was - that hasn't happened in a long time! It also cuts blow drying time, which I love. The only pseudo-negative thing I would say is that I wouldn't use this if you need some structure to your style. It makes your hair very soft, so it won't hold a certain shape if you're trying to accomplish that. I typically just blow dry and flat iron my hair with a slight bend on the ends and it works great for that type of style.",

It does fill in my scraggly ends a bit, but so did my Pureology split end mender,  I'll have to give the product more of a chance.  It doesn't weigh my hair down, smells nice, but my hair is just as smooth, frizzy and flat as before.  I don't think it's some miracle product, which, is not surprising but is still disappointing. For now, I can't recommend this strictly due to price outweighing the results.",
