        "comments": "It looks like Neutrogena discontinued the Ultra gentle hydrating cleanser CREAMY FORMULA and came up with this new foaming formula which if you are sensitive to fragrance this product will make your skin to react.  The original creamy formula was recommended by my dermatologist around 15 years ago.   My skin is acne prone sensitive so I am in big trouble trying to find a replacement.  It is frustrating that theAMAZING formulas get reformulated or changed completely.  Why if the product was already fantastic??? Disappointing!!!",

        "comments": "I really wanted to rate this product 5 stars but why the fragrance??? Labeling a product 'Ultra Gentle' and then adding fragrance to it! Really? I cannot figure out the smell... It's disgusting. Same goes for the other 2 Ultra Gentle products. Sad thing is, I love them all. This cleanser is awesome but the fragrance gets to me. It really does give you a slight headache to us fragrance sensitive individuals. There's no need for it! I love how companies think 'fragrance' will be accepted & liked by all. That's not always the case. Leave it out when formulating for sensitive skin!!",
