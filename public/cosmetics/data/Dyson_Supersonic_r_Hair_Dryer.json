As others have said, the cool shot button on this hair dryer is in a weird place - I always have to fumble around to find it while drying my hair - the button seems higher than I would naturally expect it to be. Because this hair dryer is SO expensive, I hope it lasts a LONG time. My other Dyson hair dryer would over heat and shut off - other than that, it was fine. I routinely cleaned the filter area on my previous Dyson hair dryer, but I believe] the filter area was the problem with the hair dryer over heating. Hopefully, this version of the Dyson hair dryer is a better design - time will tell.",

I previously owned the pink Dyson dryer (not the nural version) but my hair is fine and a bit dry with color treated ends so those supersonic powerful/forceful hair driers just make my hair too frizzy and hard to manage so I sold that one and wrote Dysons off as just to powerful for fine hair. But after the experience in the salon I thought maybe this one is the happy medium that works well. I also have a wrist injury to consider because I'm having a hard time rotating my wrist without pain and losing grip strength at certain angles. This dryer is so light and ergonomic it doesn't exacerbate the injury. It dries fast but gently enough to not make my hair frizzy. It looks great every time and dont feel like its wrecking my hair with heat damage. The attachments are really helpful and the button placements are not intrusive or easy to push while using it. The only thing I dont love is how pricy this version is. I got it when Ulta had 20% off and even that's a hard price to justify. But alas, I love it and would purchase it again.",

It is so expensive that I was a little on edge to buy it , but I liked my original Dyson Hair Dryer so well, that I thought I will try it. I loved it when I opened the box and loved it after about 6 uses now. I do wish it would have come with the one extra attachmenet that I have seen  , but I am very happy with this purchase. No disappointment at all. It is always so nice to get something that is just as perfect as you hoped it would be. No complaints. I am so glad I purchased it.",

My hair is still damp underneath for another 6-7 hours. \n\nToday, I took my towel off and put my regular stuff in my hair, adding Kenra Blow Dry Spray - which I always use when drying my hair. When I tell you my roots were dry in UNDER 5 minutes I am not exaggerating. It was nearly unbelievable! It usuallly takes 20 - 25 minutes to dry my hair. And my hair is super soft and silky.",
