My last order the product changed to Light Reveler Natural Skin Illuminator which I like however, the color 1N2 Vanille, that was perfect for me is no longer available.  Cameo is a bit lighter and I feel a bit washed out with it.  \nHope Laura Mercier considers bringing back Vanille.",

I tried applying this with bare skin on moisturizer, on primer, I've tried it alone with no product. It doesn't settle into the skin and moved around, it's splotchy, it's uneven. I've tried using hands, sponges, and brushes. The only way this product looks good is if you apply it in the dark. Will be returning this. I have NEVER left a bad review before, but this definitely deserves it.",

This product lays horribly on my face making my bumps look bigger and more noticeable. On top of that it moves during the day and reliably makes me cry after 6 hours of wear or even sooner if im smiling a lot and squinting my eyes. I am careful to not put it too close to my undereyes but it still moves up. The skin illuminator does not make me glow. I am so disappointed in this product i had such higher hopes. The only good thing is the spf in it, but at the same time thats probably what makes me cry. It stings so badly.",

If I use a blender you can see clumps. If I use a brush you can see pilling, and so on. It won't adhere. I've tried using a moisturizer under it, a primer, and just going bare skinned. Makes no difference. It also clumps very badly to the very fine peach fuzz I have on the sides of my face. I don't understand why it won't just SIT on my face. Every time I try this I have to wipe it off and start over with something different. So frustrating! I've never had this experience with a sunblock or a foundation.",

I have many tinted moisturizers and this is far from the best I've used. It is not terribly hydrating and feels a bit sticky and heavy when first applied. There is zero coverage as it is extremely sheer and it is not easy to blend. It is probably not great for someone with large pores as it can show texture. All that said, it does give the skin a beautiful, soft illuminating effect on well prepped skin. There is a diverse shade selection and I got a good match for my skintone. I think it is overpriced for what it is but at 50% off it was worth trying. I think  I will probably keep it but it's definitely not for everyone.",

        "comments": "I have absolutely fallen in love with this! It gives such a nice, radiant finish. My skin looks flawless when I wear it, without looking cakey. I love that it has SPF in it and that it is also moisturizing. This would be my go to for everyday wear if I was able to wear makeup everyday. I am in healthcare and have to wear an N95 everyday, but hoping that some day I will be able to actually put on makeup for work again! If and when that happens, I will definitely be reaching for this product. The first time I used it, I attempted to use a beautyblender but found that using my hands was easier and didn't waste so much product. It is pretty liquid-y, so the blender just soaked up too much. I basically just apply it like I would a moisturized. I just can't get over how pretty the finish is, and I don't notice that it accentuates texture like some products with this finish do. It is almost like this product has some kind of micro-glitter in it to give it such a pretty glow\"¦makes me think of the glow that vampires have in the sunlight in Twilight (I'm dating myself). Anyways, this is an amazing lightweight face product that makes your skin look beautiful and you won't regret buying. I love the shade range available as well. I will say that I tried this over the Laura Mercier Blurring Pure Canvas Primer and it was a disaster, so don't do that! But that primer is garbage anyway imo, it doesn't matter what foundation product you use with it. Not sure about the other primera in that line though, as I have only tried the blurring finish.",

        "comments": "Cameo Fair with Pink Undertones: I feel kind of bad giving such a poor review, but if I'd paid full price for this I would have been SO disappointed. There's essentially no coverage. It's a sheer wash of color - in my case the wrong color which is likely adding to why I dislike it so much. I think I needed \"Petal\" which is neutral because, even though I believe I have cool undertones, Cameo didn't work on my skin tone. Despite the sheerness (it will not cover any redness or imperfections and almost makes any bumps or blemishes stand out more due to the shimmer), it's still hard to apply evenly. I normally use fingers for a tinted moisturizer but this is super streaky that way. A sponge works better but eats up product. With a tinted moisturizer I normally don't set it, if you don't this can get shinier and shinier as the day goes on due to the sheerness & shimmer. (Pro: it's light and feels nice on my face) When trying to make it work (as I've been testing it for a few weeks) I just end up adding way too much other makeup - concealer, blush, bronzer, etc and don't end up liking the overall look much. (I've dyed my hair back to dark brunette since the photos and this still isn't working out well with my coloring.) I do like the spf & the packaging. Others have mentioned the smell, that's not a huge deal to me, it smells like sunscreen but doesn't linger after application in my opinion. If you have flawless skin & are just looking for a some extra spf coverage and a glow this might be great for you for Spring & fall! I don't feel it would perform well in summer, but that's when this may end up actually matching my skin. Not every product will work well for every person and this just didn't work well for me right now. I might try it again later if my skin texture clears up a bit more, as it tends to in summer. Photos show same day and lighting with no makeup and then with only this product on right after application, then with a full face of makeup. I didn't have any red marks or anything to cover that day, but if you do this will not cover them at all - at least in my shade Cameo.",
