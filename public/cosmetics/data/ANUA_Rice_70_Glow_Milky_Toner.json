        "comments": "Skin type : Oily with severe acne prone skin including fungal acne\nThe first time I used it , it gave me acne but I expected it because it was a new product for my skin . Next day onwards the acne slowly decreased and my skin felt so relaxed and smooth and calm every time I used it . Now it has been a daily routine for me to use to before my sunscreen and moisturizer. This gives so much moisture that you don't even need to use a moisturizer once you use this( you will need to use a moisturizer if your doing makeup because this toner alone does not help for a good skin prep and a good base and to not go through cakey and crusty makeup). In conclusion this toner did such a good job for my acne and oily skin giving it a plumy glow and moisture and soothing calmness my skin needed. I love it and will purchase it more in the future.",

        "comments": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion] \n\nBeing 71% Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Water, Anua Rice 70 Glow Milky Toner has the familiar, slightly weighted viscosity of the clouded water after rinsing rice a few times. It is water weight with a bit of slip. There is no smell, even of rice. \n\nOther ingredients include glycols, the common but powerful humectant glycerin, 2% niacinamide (listed in an answer on the brand's website) and panthenol. The last three lines of the ingredients list show different ceramides and allantoin. \n\nCeramides are at their most effective strength in thicker products like creams as the ingredient ceramide itself is thick and not easy to dissolve into formulas. It may have less potency in a watery formula. \n\nHowever, I am rating this toner five stars after using it seven days morning and night, because I like the immediate plumping effect it has on my oily, dehydrated skin. This is my first experience with rice water in skincare and so far I like the instant bounce i feel, and how my skin does feel calmer with redness slightly reduced. I'll note that if i apply the toner s few times in a row, it does make my hands slightly tacky feeling. \n\nAt 2% niacinamide, I expect the toner to aid in barrier support more than evening out skintone. A concentration of 3-5% niacinamide is preferred for help with hyperpigmentation. The lower concentration means its not likely to irritate for the sensitive. \n\nI haven't used the toner long enough to experience the claimed results of sebum control (4 weeks) or improved skintone evenness, but i will happily continue to use this toner to help calm my currently irritated skin experiencing hormonal breakouts.",

        "comments": "I do wish was on the packaging, it had more directions, it simply just says \"apply an appropriate amount to the skin.\" How often should I be doing it? Once, twice a day, week? I don't know. Is it better at night, day? Can it be applied on other areas other than my face? Is it safe near the eyes? Doesn't hurt to be overly informed. I don't like to guess when it comes to things I put on my face. (There's a little more information provided on the Ulta website but not on the product itself). Now to the product itself, there is no smell which I can appreciate because I was told by a dermatologist you don't want fancy perfume stuff on your face, basic clean non scented is best. The consistency was different than what I was expecting, it's more like an oil, not sure why but I thought it would be thicker. With it being more liquidy, it was hard to keep in my hands, it kept slipping through my fingers however, application on my face was easier to spread and it felt very thin. Right away I could feel it drying and within maybe like a minute or so I felt it completely dry so it was pretty fast. Not sure if it was so much a glow than just being shiny. It did make my dry skin feel more hydrated which I appreciated. Even though the consistency is very oily, once it dried on my face, my face did not feel oily at all. A lot of the time  after I put product on my face, it feels very stiff, like it's hard to move my face around, this did not feel like that. It seemed to have lasted on my face for awhile, touched my face like two hours later and still felt soft. I did notice after a couple days of use, I had more acne than usual however I do not know if it's because of this product or related to something else. For reference, I am in my early 30's and tested this product in the winter time when my skin was prone to more dryness. **This review was created through an educational promotional event hosted between the brand and beauty experts.",
