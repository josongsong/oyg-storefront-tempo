So I was looking for an eye cream to help brighten my eyes, reduce puffiness and get rid of dark circles. I've been using this eye cream every night for two months and it has dramatically made a difference in brightening my eyes and reducing dark circles. I noticed that I have a small reduction in puffiness but I naturally have puffy under eyes (even in baby pictures at age 2) so I don't think they will ever completely go away. This eye cream is DEFINITELY too heavy for day time use so I only suggest using it at night. And a tiny bit goes a LONG way. I know I wont be done with this eye cream for AT LEAST a year but I cant wait to see how the results look after finishing the container because I already see great results. Btw, I use this eye cream on my eye lids and under eyes.",
