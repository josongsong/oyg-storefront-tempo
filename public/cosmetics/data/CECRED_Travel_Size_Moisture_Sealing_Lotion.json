        "comments": "At first, I was a little unsure on how to use this lotion because I KNOW I cannot just use one product as my styler. So I used the same styling products I normally use and then put this sealing lotion on top. GIRL! When I tell you my hair was defined and MOIST for DAYS. Even after days when I didn't go anywhere or take my bonnet off lol. My hair still remained moist and only needed slight refreshing to go out. Another notable point for me is that the front of my hair NEVER curls. It's been flat and limp for years, but not with this. My exhausted front curls were well-rested. I started with a free sample size and had to upgrade to the full size.  The scent is not overbearing, but I do enjoy it. I did a complete demonstration & review of the product line on my 3C/4A high density, high porosity hair. I tried to include the link but it won't allow me: Search \"Cècred by Beyonce Demo & Review 3C Natural Hair Wash N' Go\" if interested. May all of your curls be plump, defined, and voluminous ;)",

This didn't work as a leave-in for me. It detangles okay and it's thick but it didn't moisturize my hair like I needed it to when I used it by itself. It's true what they say- you don't need to use much of this product. If you are using the correct amount the price seems more reasonable. I've been using it OVER my leave-in when I use my revair for a blowout, and then a little bit after blowdrying mixed with a few drops of oil (not the cecred oil) to help seal in moisture and I think it has helped prevent my hair from reverting as much which is nice! My hair has been noticably more moisturized after blowdrying when I use this. I think this is a nice product for heat styled hair but not for natural styles, from my experience. My TGIN green tea leave-in is still holy grail (moisturizes for any style, softens, &  detangles like a dream) -I'll keep experimenting with the bottle I have but I probably won't repurchase this. I love the smell though!",

        "comments": "This has happened with a few products (most their deep conditioner) where I hated it at first and then grew to love it. I think this product is too thick for my fine hair (like the DC) but the ingredients are so good for my hair, my hair just thrives with it. I was skeptical before about using this as my hair didn't \"feel\" moisturized but now I respect it so much more as a blowout primer. And honestly I think that's the mistake Cecred made with this. I think sealing lotion is not a good name. I expected a lighter texture for a lotion and there are no film formers so the sealing part felt like a miss. I think naming it \"blowout primer\" would have set expectations better and helped people understand how to use this. Also, Cecred products are concentrated, and that's especially true of the moisture sealing lotion. I feel like that's not obvious when you start using the brand. So yes, now that I understand how to use the product and what to expect from it, it's still thicker than I would like but I love it now. I returned it initially and then went back and repurchased it. I wish she would come out with a lighter version of this for the fine textured girlies but yea, it's a win to me now.",

        "comments": "This has happened with a few products (most their deep conditioner) where I hated it at first and then grew to love it. I think this product is too thick for my fine hair (like the DC) but the ingredients are so good for my hair, my hair just thrives with it. I was skeptical before about using this as my hair didn't \"feel\" moisturized but now I respect it so much more as a blowout primer. And honestly I think that's the mistake Cecred made with this. I think sealing lotion is not a good name. I expected a lighter texture for a lotion and there are no film formers so the sealing part felt like a miss. I think naming it \"blowout primer\" would have set expectations better and helped people understand how to use this. Also, Cecred products are concentrated, and that's especially true of the moisture sealing lotion. I feel like that's not obvious when you start using the brand. So yes, now that I understand how to use the product and what to expect from it, it's still thicker than I would like but I love it now. I returned it initially and then went back and repurchased it. I wish she would come out with a lighter version of this for the fine textured girlies but yea, it's a win to me now.",

        "comments": "I bought the shampoo/conditioner trial trio. The scrub shampoo really cleans my scalp, five stars for that. I bought this lotion separately. I used it on my wet/damp hair right out the shower. It smells really, really good from the shampoo, the conditioner and the lotion! 5 stars for the smell. It doesn't have any hold, however, so remove a start for that. I used it this morning on dry hair and it was efficient for taming the scraggly fly-aways. I am Afro -Latina. I have 2C curls at the nape of my neck, 3a/3b throughout and some 4a curls in wide strips at my temples and by my ears. I also have some 2c patterns sprinkled in on the crown. The hair product line says that it is inclusive to all hair types but I think Beyonce forgot about the mixed girls or the ones with European or Indigenous heritages in their lineage. I hope she comes out with a styling gel with medium/firm hold. I must also take away a star for the lack of help with definition, unless I am not misunderstanding what the function of this lotion is. It may also not be for my type of hair. I have to find some way to tame those wispy 2c flyaways. I will probably use the scrub shampoo several days a week for a good cleanse to break down buildup. I will probably also use the conditioner every now and again but I think I will keep the lotion for the days I am on vacation at the beach as a treatment for the saltwater damage to my hair. The rest of the products and oils will probably be too heavy for my hair. I will continue to use my DevaCurl and Innersense cleansing and styling products. Please come out with some styling products for the Beckys with the good hair.",
