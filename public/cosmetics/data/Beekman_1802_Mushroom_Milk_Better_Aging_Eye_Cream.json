        "comments": "I've been using this for a little over a year and I am thoroughly happy with it. I have allergies and weepy eyes so the skin around them is always dry and sometimes flaky and inflamed. Most eye creams I've used just sit on the surface and get washed away or pill up when my eyes water. This one absorbs really well and the skin feels very nourished after it sinks in. It also smooths and calms. I will say that it doesn't really help with dark circles but the eye serum from Beekman does a good job at that so I layer the serum and then the cream. I didn't realize how much of a difference the combo was making until I ran out of the serum a couple of months ago. \n\nA little goes a long way with this one so the price tag if justified, in my opinion. I really only have to get a new one every 5 or 6 months and that's with twice daily use. \n\nThis sits beautifully under makeup and is a creates a great, hydrated base for my concealer. I highly recommend!",

        "comments": "The Beekman 1802 Mushroom Milk Better Aging Eye Cream is boasted as a clinically proven eye cream that reduces fine lines and dark circles after using for 5 days. This formula utilizes goat milk, which is supposed to be very gentle and mimic the natural skin pH to help with absortion. This formula is more on the lighter-medium side, which is perfect for everyday use in the daytime and absorbs quickly. It goes on light and spreads easily and I've never had any irritation from this. After using this consistently, I have noticed that there is a brightness to my dark circles and gives a depuffed look - this could be due to the mushroom ingredients (Snow Mushroom, Reishi Mushroom) as well as Kojic acid for a brightened look. It keeps a hydrated look and does seem to smoothen out fine lines in this area. \n\nDue to the effects that I have noticed from the Beekman 1802 Mushroom Milk Better Aging Eye Cream - I would say that this product definitely supports its claims with the formula and is much better than other similar eye creams that I have tried. I think that the amount of product that is given is very generous and I love the simple squeeze tube packaging - it is minimal plastic waste and is sanitary. I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family who are looking for a new eye cream to try out. I feel that this product is targeted towards people in their teens-40s. Anyone above this age group may not benefit much from this product due to the need for deeper hydration and more active ingredients.",

        "comments": "I did receive this product for free in exchange for writing an honest review. It's hard to tell if a product is actually preventing / helping the looks of aging (how do you know what fine lines, etc you would've gotten had you NOT used the product?), so I can't really review on that. I can't say my eyes \"looked more youthful  within 5 days.\" I feel like your skin needs more than 5 days to show the benefits of skin care. I did like the consistency of this product, and it absorbed well.  I tend to have a dryish eye area, and I felt this didn't moisturize the way other eye creams I've used had. After about 3-4 weeks of regular use, I can tell my eye area is dryer than before I started using this product. I did not experience dry patches/ flakiness, nor did I have any eye twitching problems (for real experienced side effect of some well known brands out there). If Mushroom Milk was great at moisturizing, I would continue to use this product. If you're eye are isn't dry, I say give the product a go. Otherwise, I'd hold off on this one.",
