My favorite attatchments are the fast hair dryer and the big barrel. The id curl is such an awesome function! Makes my hair dry SO fast (i was using a conair hair dryer before) and the air wrap curls are so voluminous!! I also feel like my hair is less damaged now than using my curling iron. Steep price but worth it. Wait til it goes on sale and save your ulta points to get the best deal! :) \n\nThe only two cons about the dyson air wrap id is the bulky cord and the price tag.",

        "comments": "I recently bought the airwrap i.d. to replace my original airwrap origins for long hair. It's basically the same tool with smart technology and a couple of different attachments. I absolutely love this tool. I can't believe I went so many years without it. When I first got my original there was a huge learning curve and I was not having much success with achieving the look I wanted. Because I spent so much money on it I was determined to figure it out so I watched at least a dozen YouTube videos with tutorials on how to get the most out of the airwrap and after enough practice I finally got the hang of it. The i.d. version works exactly the same way but you can connect it to your smart phone via bluetooth and the app controls each step: wrapping, curling, cool shot. You no longer have to think about it. I get that counting how long to curl your hair is not that difficult, but this version costs the same as the non-connected version (at least for now) so for the same amount of money why not get the more advanced version? You don't have to use the smart phone app if you don't want to. You can also customize the timings on each step to your own preferences. The conical wand is amazing. I was skeptical about it at first and preferred to use the larger straight barrel but after giving the conical barrel a shot I am hooked. I believe you can buy this attachment from Dyson so if you have an older machine but want to try the new barrel you can just buy one from them. All their attachments are interchangeable with all their machines. If you invest in this device I strongly recommend that you watch as many YouTube tutorials that you can and try each of their tips and recommendations. My hair is long and fine and holding a curl is a challenge. With the right styling products and the Dyson air wrap, I have far more good hair days than bad ones.",

It generally takes me an hour to blow dry and style my hair with a blow dryer and curling iron.   My hair  was damp when I started and looks like I just left the salon.  It literally took me about 15 minutes to curl my hair. There is so much volume.  I cant wait to try out other attachments.",

        "comments": "I recently bought the airwrap i.d. to replace my original airwrap origins for long hair. It's basically the same tool with smart technology and a couple of different attachments. I absolutely love this tool. I can't believe I went so many years without it. When I first got my original there was a huge learning curve and I was not having much success with achieving the look I wanted. Because I spent so much money on it I was determined to figure it out so I watched at least a dozen YouTube videos with tutorials on how to get the most out of the airwrap and after enough practice I finally got the hang of it. The i.d. version works exactly the same way but you can connect it to your smart phone via bluetooth and the app controls each step: wrapping, curling, cool shot. You no longer have to think about it. I get that counting how long to curl your hair is not that difficult, but this version costs the same as the non-connected version (at least for now) so for the same amount of money why not get the more advanced version? You don't have to use the smart phone app if you don't want to. You can also customize the timings on each step to your own preferences. The conical wand is amazing. I was skeptical about it at first and preferred to use the larger straight barrel but after giving the conical barrel a shot I am hooked. I believe you can buy this attachment from Dyson so if you have an older machine but want to try the new barrel you can just buy one from them. All their attachments are interchangeable with all their machines. If you invest in this device I strongly recommend that you watch as many YouTube tutorials that you can and try each of their tips and recommendations. My hair is long and fine and holding a curl is a challenge. With the right styling products and the Dyson air wrap, I have far more good hair days than bad ones.",
