I'm very impressed! my one gripe is the entire tip broke off the tube so there's just a hole. I'm afraid it will dry out so I need to find a small container to put it in.",

It doesn't smooth out it, does not plump up the under eye skin, it does not plump up fine lines, it doesn't moisturize. It just seems to absorb underneath the eye and then it goes back to feeling dry as it was before.  It's not a primer either.  Honestly if I put on any other primer or skin moisturizer would probably do the same job so I would say save your money",

I don't apply it to my under eye, but my upper eyelid to the brows. I'm not sure if this an incorrect way to use it but it works. I have mono eyelids and it helps pull my eyelids up all day for a nice fresh look all day!!! \n\nSeriously A MUST HAVE. It's so gentle on my eyelid and relaxing to tap on. I don't trust a lot of random products on my eyelids other than eyeshadow and eyeliner, but I'm so glad I used this cream serum product. It has literally changed the game for me.",

It has a siilky, elegant formulation, goes on smoothly and absorbs with no residue--skin immediately looks rested, smoother & hydrated--i find that it replaces my eye primer even MORE effectively than my go-to.  Will NEVER be without it--thanks, ULTA, for staying on top of great new indie brands!",

It does leave my under eye area feeling moisturized, and it doesn't ball when other products are used over it, but I don't notice much difference of the eye puffiness or fine lines after applied. I will keep using it as a moisturizer, but I will not purchase again.",
