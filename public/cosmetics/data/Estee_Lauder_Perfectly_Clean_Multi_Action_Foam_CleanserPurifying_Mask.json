Literally makes my skin squeaky clean and feeling totally purified. My sample of this is almost used up and I'm definitely buying the full size and replacing my other cleansers with this one. My complexion is so much clearer now and my makeup sets much better when I start my day fresh with this. A little goes a long way and the frothy texture feels luxurious. It's also gentle on my sensitive skin. This stuff is the jackpot, I absolutely love it.",

The effectiveness of this as a mask almost knocked me off my feet. I did as instructed and applied to dry skin for 3 minutes. When washed it off my pores seemed to have spit up what're was clogging them. I can't say I've ever had such an immediate and positive result with a mask. However, because the fragrance is so strong, I couldn't wait to was this off. It's not an unpleasant scent, I just which I could turn it down about 80%. I got this as a sample and I'm not sure if I'll use it again solely because of the smell. I highly recommend this if strong fragrances don't bother you, but if they do, stay clear!",

The price may be a bit in the luxury zone for a face wash for a lot of people but this face wash is for \"normal skin\" however my skin tends to go from dry in winters to oily in summers and this stuff is great for both times. It doesnt strip my skin of its oils at all. I have tried many face washes from drunk elephant, neutrogena stuff, and even glossier. All of those irritate my skin in some way or strip it to where it feels dry and flakey. Not this cleanser though. It cleans while keeping my skin smooth and healthy.",

I usually don't mind a slight fragrance in my cleansers, but this is simply too strong. Like, way too strong! \n\nIt also burns the absolute heck out of my eyes if it gets near them. My eyes aren't too sensitive if a gentle cleanser accidentally gets in them, but this product burns like no other!\nI do like the feel of cleanliness it delivers and it makes my skin feel squeaky clean. \n\nBottom line, if you can stand a cleanser with a bottle of perfume dumped into it and don't mind pouring alcohol in your eyes, then this cleanser is for you!",
