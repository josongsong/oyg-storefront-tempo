        "comments": "At my dermatologist's suggestion, I started looking for a daily face sunscreen that had a higher SPF than 30. After some failed attempts with just sunscreen products, I decided to try this moisturizer + sunscreen. I'm very happy with the purchase! I can tell the difference in the increased SPF protection, and also feel that my face is staying hydrated. I have really oily skin and, for me, this product provides good oil control and a mattifying effect. It smells lightly of sunscreen, but it dissapates quickly once absorbed. The only con, hence the loss of one star, is that the consistency is a little thick and tacky, so it pulls on my skin quite a bit when applying, which I don't appreciate. But it is not a deal breaker for me at this point. Otherwise, a good option for increased daily face protection.",

When I apply it, it goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and gives my skin a nice matte finish without feeling dry or tight. I have combination skin, and this does a great job keeping the shine away throughout the day, especially in my T-zone area. My pores look more blurred when I wear it, and I notice my makeup applies better on top of it too. The scent in my opinion is subtle, but it's there. It smells clean and slightly herbal, kind of like a soft citrus and tea tree blend, but it fades quickly once it's on my skin. I like it, it makes the application feel more refreshing without being overpowering or like a strong perfume fragrance. The sunscreen didn't irritate my skin at all, which is always a plus for me with scented products. On really hot and humid days, I did notice a bit of shine peeking through by the afternoon, but nothing too bad and I still feel like my skin looks smoother than usual.",

The only pro is the SPF did work, but I feel like that's the bare minimum of what this product should do. I'll probably still use it up, but I won't be buying again.",

When I apply it, it goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and gives my skin a nice matte finish without feeling dry or tight. I have combination skin, and this does a great job keeping the shine away throughout the day, especially in my T-zone area. My pores look more blurred when I wear it, and I notice my makeup applies better on top of it too. The scent in my opinion is subtle, but it's there. It smells clean and slightly herbal, kind of like a soft citrus and tea tree blend, but it fades quickly once it's on my skin. I like it, it makes the application feel more refreshing without being overpowering or like a strong perfume fragrance. The sunscreen didn't irritate my skin at all, which is always a plus for me with scented products. On really hot and humid days, I did notice a bit of shine peeking through by the afternoon, but nothing too bad and I still feel like my skin looks smoother than usual.",
