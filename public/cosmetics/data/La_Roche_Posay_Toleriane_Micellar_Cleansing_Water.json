I use it 2 to 3 times a week (morning or evening), @ times when I do NOT need or feel to wash in the morning or just lazy to wash before bedtime. Good on removing eye makeup.  :0) \n Skin is cleansed, refreshed, & toned. NO irritation and/or redness. NO tight or overstripped feeling. Light fragrance to it.",

I repeat do not use on your eyes to remove any makeup! \"This no rinse micellar water\" has fragrance and it burns even after washing it off and washing my face and throwing copious amounts of water on my eyes and using a tissue to dry my eyes they burn and are extremely red and irritated! This is not safe for your eyes! Please take out the fragrance there is no need for it! I love all their other products except this one.",
