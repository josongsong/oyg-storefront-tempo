However, I'm pleased to share that my skin has since adapted well to it, and I now genuinely enjoy using this toner. It's remarkable how my skin has acclimated over time, allowing me to incorporate it seamlessly into my routine. The initial hesitation was definitely worth it, and I'm now reaping the benefits of this toner. It's become a staple I look forward to using regularly!",
