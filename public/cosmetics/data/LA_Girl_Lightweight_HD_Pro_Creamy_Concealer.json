It is so dark it is so orange. So googling, colors watches and looking at them on people's arms. Everybody seems to have the same complaint that they come out very orange. The colors look absolutely nothing like the picture. I will be returning this and buying something different. That is very misleading and a waste of my time. Never, ever have I seen a color be so off the way that this is",

It's so easy to apply when I'm in a rush, I just brush a bit of it on my t-zone, then blend it out with a dense foundation brush and it gives me light to medium coverage in seconds. The only somewhat negative thing is that it isn't the best for oily skin but I'm okay with that because it's my life saver almost everyday since I'm always running late and need to slap my makeup on as quickly as possible. I do not think I could live without these cute lil squishy concealers. LA Girl really has our broke cheeks' backs hehe",

In my case though it clung to ALL of my dry places- even ones that aren't too bad. I tried this concealer in so many different ways but no matter what it didn't work. As soon as I put it on it made my skin look dry and was super patchy. As the day went on it started getting crapey under my eyes and my makeup just looked bad. This would be good for someone who wants light coverage and has oily skin. For someone who wants full coverage, this is not it. My other two complaints is that the lightest color beside the white one is still not light enough to highlight with and there is not much product in the tube, especially if you are going to highlight your whole face with it. Overall I can see where this could be good for some, but for me it was a disaster.",
