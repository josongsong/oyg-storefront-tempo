        "comments": "The DevaCurl Styling Cream is a true game-changer for those with curly or wavy hair. As someone who struggles with managing frizz and defining curls, this product has exceeded my expectations.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about this styling cream is its rich and creamy texture. It feels luxurious and spreads easily through damp hair, which makes application a breeze. Despite its thickness, the cream doesn't weigh down my curls or leave any greasy residue, which is a huge plus.\n\nAfter using the DevaCurl Styling Cream and letting my hair air dry or diffusing it, I was amazed by the results. My curls looked more defined, bouncy, and frizz-free. This cream seems to work its magic by enhancing my natural curl pattern, creating soft, touchable curls that last throughout the day.\n\nWhat sets this styling cream apart from others I've tried is its ability to provide both moisture and hold. It doesn't leave my hair feeling dry or stiff, but rather, it keeps it hydrated and adds a natural-looking hold that isn't overly rigid.\n\nI also appreciate that this product is free from sulfates, parabens, and silicones, making it a healthier option for my hair. It's enriched with nourishing ingredients that promote hair health, which is essential for maintaining curls' integrity in the long run.\n\nThe scent of the DevaCurl Styling Cream is delightful, too – not overpowering but pleasantly fresh, leaving a subtle fragrance in my hair.\n\nWhile this styling cream has been a game-changer for my curly hair, I would recommend users with finer or straight hair to use it sparingly, as it might be too heavy for their hair type.\n\nAll in all, the DevaCurl Styling Cream is a top-notch product for enhancing curls, combating frizz, and providing lasting hold without sacrificing hair health. If you have curly or wavy hair and are looking for a styling cream that truly delivers, this one is worth trying.",

Unfortunately, they decided to remove all of the lovely plant extracts (rosemary, hops, etc.) and replaced them with the standard chemicals found in cheaper products plus loads of awful perfume smell. Instead of a nice, light scent, it is an overpowering smell of old lady perfume. Completely awful. It was so strong that I had to take benadryl to clear my sinuses and after I washed my hair it still slightly smelled. Who wants that? I am so disappointed. The product still works very well, but it no longer has the light \"lemon and lime zest\" scent that they claim and the same ingredients I can get in a $4 product. I will no longer be using DevaCurl products.",
