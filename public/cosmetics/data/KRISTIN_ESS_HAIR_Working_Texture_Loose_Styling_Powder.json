It's been difficult to do, especially for any significant period of time. This product is perfect- it feels sticky and adds a lot of grit and hold without weighing down my hair. I also really like the way it's dispensed- it can sometimes be hard to get powder products evenly distributed all over my head, so the \"spray\" style is really handy for that. I feel like this was the missing piece in my hair routine that hairspray, pomade, and gel all failed to fill.",

The big sexy hair powder is a 10/10 for me, but i think its ~$20 (wait for a sale). This product does give volume but I don't find it to be long lasting. I have to kind of run my fingers through my roots and get it going again. I also feel like feel like I notice flakes in my hair when I use this but honestly not sure if it's from the powder because I do have dry skin but never notice it with the big sexy one. You definitely get a lot of product and I love that it's a pump so you can easily apply. I just think this product is almost too sticky and you'll end up feeling the need to wash your hair within a day or two after using, which is a downside for me because I typically use this after washing my hair to give it some texture back, so it's not flat.",

I would never, ever put this product all over my hair (unless I was trying to create dreadlocks). But, if you concentrate it at the roots, it will give you tons of volume and lift, while leaving the length of your hair shiny and bouncy. I have fine, thin hair, and this will be my new go-to. Just remember— a little goes a long way, and use only on the roots! The price is a great value, too!",

Instead, this stuff made my hair sticky, to the point where I couldn't even run my fingers throughout. I have experimented with using less, thinking maybe I overdid it the first time? This stuff is not for normal, everyday, \"just want to add a little volume\" person. This would be perfect for maybe a professional to use in an updo that needs to remain perfectly in place for 72 hours? Or maybe a synchronized swimmer to use to keep her hair in place? I don't think this is a \"bad\" product, it just really is not at all what I was looking for.",

I have very thick hair and when I'm working or in a hurry sometimes my hair can get in my way and I need a quick solution. This set certainly makes it very easy to do a quick updo with a cute elegant touch to your hair. I will say this does not work the best for those with very thin hair unless your hair has enough length to make a nice twist up bun to place it in. This is definitely a great way to wear your hair differently for a change. The gold coating seems to be durable and not easy to scratch. The pins are not too heavy but just right so they don't pull down your hair or have an annoying heaviness to your hair. I certainly recommend this set for anyone looking or an easy updo for change.",

I tried pulling up tutorials on YouTube, however I just couldn't get them to hold my hair. I do think they are really attractive and have a nice look for a classic hairstyle.",
