It's atrocious and so overpowering, I feel like I have to open a window when I use it. Seriously. Its that bad. If it was non scented or had a very light acent I'd probably give it 5 stars. But the smell is enough to knock off 3 stars.",

This Living Proof Perfect hair Day Heat Styling Spray made my hair feel so good. It protected my hair, but it also made it feel clean and fresh. I was able to style my hair, beautifully, for several days without washing it. There was no buildup or stickiness. The only real downside was the INTENSE scent. I had to leave the room for a minute, immediately after spraying it. It has a thick powdery overwhelming cloud of scent that you can actually taste. I decided to give it a chance, though, and so glad I did. I received mine as a free sample from PINCHme, but I could see myself buying this(on sale, though!)",

The only difference ive noticed with this is. The smell  it stays and i like the smell i can't tell where its at on my hair so i cant feel where i put it  so i end up using more to insure i am covered not a bad thing but its light weight and easy to use i just like the reassurance. It doesnt hold my curls and that could be just my hair because i used this with clean hair so its not fair to say this was the problem. The pros of this product is the smell,softness after use, shine and feel of hair and protection.and cons are you use more and possibly makes curls fall and not last as long.",
