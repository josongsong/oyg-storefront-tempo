So I ordered the full she and started using it daily to remove my sunscreen and yes I double cleanse and I did wet my hands and emulsified before rinsing and going with my water base regular face wash, it's been let's say almost 2 weeks and I started noticing some texture in my forehead buuuuut suddenly I woke up with this TERRIBLE reaction, acne type of breakouts in my whole face, some hurt, some itch, some look swollen. I'm now trying to recover my skin, with minimal tried skin care (just face wash, sunscreen am and face wash light lotion pm), I'm scared because this is the first time this happens to me, I used to have severe acne in my teenager years, now I'm 42 and having this experience makes me think that I need to be more careful when using new products. Wonderful product but NOT FOR MY SKIN 🥲",

        "comments": "Here's a detailed review of Anua Skincare and its products:\n\nAnua Skincare Review: A New Staple in My Routine\n\nAs someone with combination skin, finding skincare products that balance oil control without over-drying can be a challenge. But entering the new year, I discovered Anua Skincare, and it has completely elevated my routine. From cleansing to toning, their products deliver impressive results that cater to my skin's unique needs. Below, I'll share my experience with three standout products from their lineup: the Pore Cleansing Foam, the Heartleaf 77+ Soothing Toner, and the Cleansing Oil.\n\nPore Cleansing Foam: My Favorite New Cleanser\n\nThe Anua Pore Cleansing Foam has quickly become my favorite new cleanser, and I couldn't be more excited to bring it into the new year with me. This gentle yet effective cleanser strikes the perfect balance for my combination skin. It thoroughly removes dirt, oil, and impurities without leaving my skin feeling stripped or tight.\n\nWhat I appreciate most about this foam is how it deeply cleanses my pores while maintaining hydration. The lightweight, airy texture feels luxurious as I massage it onto my skin, and it lathers beautifully, creating a refreshing cleansing experience. After each use, my skin feels clean, balanced, and smooth, which is ideal for prepping it for the rest of my skincare routine.\n\nIf you're searching for a new cleanser to kickstart your year, the Pore Cleansing Foam is worth every penny. It works wonderfully for combination skin, and its gentle formula makes it suitable for daily use.\n\nHeartleaf 77+ Soothing Toner: A Daily Essential\n\nThe Heartleaf 77+ Soothing Toner has become a staple in my routine for its gentle, calming properties. I use it every day, and it's perfect for balancing my skin after cleansing. Infused with 77% heartleaf extract, this toner is incredibly soothing, making it ideal for sensitive or irritated skin.\n\nThe lightweight formula absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it hydrated and refreshed without any sticky residue. I've noticed that it helps calm redness and keeps my skin's moisture barrier intact, even during colder months when my skin tends to get drier in certain areas.\n\nWhat sets this toner apart is its simplicity and effectiveness. It doesn't try to do too much—it just delivers what your skin needs: hydration, soothing, and balance. Whether you're a skincare minimalist or looking for a gentle toner to layer into your multi-step routine, the Heartleaf 77+ Soothing Toner is a must-have.\n\nCleansing Oil: The Perfect Makeup Remover\n\nThe Anua Cleansing Oil is another standout product that deserves a spot in any skincare routine, especially if you wear makeup. I've found it to be incredibly effective at breaking down even the most stubborn makeup, including waterproof mascara and long-wear foundation.\n\nWhat I love most about this cleansing oil is how easily it emulsifies with water, transforming into a milky consistency that rinses off effortlessly. Unlike some other cleansing oils I've tried, this one doesn't leave a greasy residue behind. My skin feels clean, soft, and hydrated after every use.\n\nHowever, I do find myself needing to use more pumps than I initially expected to remove all my makeup completely. If you're someone who wears heavier makeup, you might need to double the number of pumps for thorough cleansing. That said, the results are worth it, as it leaves no trace of makeup or impurities behind.\n\nThis cleansing oil pairs perfectly with the Pore Cleansing Foam as part of a double-cleansing routine. Together, they ensure my skin is completely clean and ready to absorb the benefits of the toner and other skincare products.\n\nWhy Anua Stands Out\n\nWhat sets Anua apart is its thoughtful formulations that cater to a wide range of skin types, including combination and sensitive skin. Each product is designed to work harmoniously with the others, creating a seamless routine that addresses multiple skin concerns while keeping the skin's natural balance in mind.\n\nI also appreciate that Anua emphasizes gentle, skin-friendly ingredients. The inclusion of heartleaf extract in many of their products highlights their commitment to calming and soothing the skin, which is especially important for those dealing with irritation or sensitivity.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAs I walk into the new year with Anua as part of my skincare routine, I feel confident that my skin is in good hands. The Pore Cleansing Foam is an absolute favorite, giving me a clean slate every day without stripping my skin. The Heartleaf 77+ Soothing Toner provides the gentle hydration and balance my combination skin craves. And the Cleansing Oil ensures that every trace of makeup and dirt is removed, leaving my skin soft, refreshed, and ready for the next steps.\n\nIf you're on the hunt for a skincare brand that delivers gentle yet effective solutions, I highly recommend giving Anua a try. Whether you're just starting your skincare journey or looking to refine your routine, their products offer something for everyone.\n\nHere's to healthy, glowing skin with Anua!\n\nLet me know if you'd like any adjustments or additional details!",

So I ordered the full she and started using it daily to remove my sunscreen and yes I double cleanse and I did wet my hands and emulsified before rinsing and going with my water base regular face wash, it's been let's say almost 2 weeks and I started noticing some texture in my forehead buuuuut suddenly I woke up with this TERRIBLE reaction, acne type of breakouts in my whole face, some hurt, some itch, some look swollen. I'm now trying to recover my skin, with minimal tried skin care (just face wash, sunscreen am and face wash light lotion pm), I'm scared because this is the first time this happens to me, I used to have severe acne in my teenager years, now I'm 42 and having this experience makes me think that I need to be more careful when using new products. Wonderful product but NOT FOR MY SKIN 🥲",
