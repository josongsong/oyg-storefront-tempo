The packaging is so adorable; it's like carrying a little piece of happiness in your pocket! The pastel color and cute little details just make me smile every time I pull it out. :sparkles:\n\nThe scent is simply divine! It's like a sweet, gentle breeze of fresh flowers with a hint of vanilla. :tulip::icecream: It's not overpowering at all, just enough to make you feel like you're walking through a garden every time you apply it.\n\nAnd let me tell you, my lips have never felt better! :kiss: This chapstick glides on so smoothly, leaving my lips super soft and hydrated. It's like a little spa treatment for my lips every time I use it. Plus, it leaves the prettiest subtle shine that makes my lips look naturally luscious. :sparkling_heart:\n\nHonestly, I never leave home without it! If you're looking for a chapstick that's as cute as it is effective, this is definitely the one. :two_hearts:",

My niece uses the Bubble line and she wanted to try this lip balm. So I ended up purchasing two for me and her to try out. We both agreed it doesn't last unfortunately, it's moisturizing at first but you have to reapply quite often. I would mention it's very similar to StarFace lipbalm, but that one stays moisturizing and you don't need to reapply as often. Not too bad, but if you have super dry lips I'd recommend StarFace lipbalm instead!",
