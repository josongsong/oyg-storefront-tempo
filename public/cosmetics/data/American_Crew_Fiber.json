The issue with this product is that it can be tricky to work it in. It can be put in dry (I prefer to put in products dry), but sometimes it does not work well with other products. The optimal way to put it in is to have your hair freshly washed and only barely damp; the product will then blend in well and have a good hold. There are other better cream-paste-wax combination products available at Ulta that are more versatile (wet or dry) and have a better hold.",

True to form, I was underwhelmed as I usually am with American Crew products.  I've never understood the popularity of this brand.  Anyway, Fiber is basically a really hard wax that comes out of the can kind of chunky instead of smooth, so it's a little hard to get just the right amount.  While it does a decent job, I've noticed that it can make your hair look a little greasy if you put it in when it's a little too damp.  If you wait until your hair is dry to put it in, it's really, really hard to work through and makes you feel like you're pulling your hair out.  If you like this, good for you.  I don't.",
