        "comments": "So i feel the efficacy of this product is contingent on personal skin goals. In my case, I tried this because im in my late 30's and have been struggling with hormonal acne, mostly on my chin/jawline area. This has not cleared up any of my acne, all it did was dry out my face. However, I feel that this toner would be great for a teen or someone who is just trying to control an oily face, not someone with active hormonal acne. Its definitely not for anyone whose skin is dry/combo because all it will do is strip the moisture from your skin. I use the acne exfoliating toner by Peach Slices now and it is much more effective for me.",

        "comments": "I used to use witch hazel, but I switched to this toner about 10 years ago, after I read an article about Mally Roncal, who mentioned using it, and she has amazing, ageless skin. I have sensitive, aging, combination skin, but this toner just \"clears the decks\" without any over-drying or irritation, and makes it seems like I have great, balanced, healthy young skin. I am now in my mid-forties and people never think so, which leads them to ask what products I use on my skin and I always tell them: Mario Basdescu. I hope Ulta keeps selling it in stores and if you are on the fence, just go for it! (And if you are looking to pair it w/ a great moisturizer, I love Mario Badescu's oil free moisturizer with SPF 30 too.)",

I've been using this for a week and have already noticed an improvement in my skin. Even though it has alcohol, I don't find it to be drying. I used to moisturize religiously at night but my skin doesn't feel dry or thirsty after using this so I've been slipping moisturizer for the most part. In the morning I use a hydrating primer and it's a perfect combo.",

I gave it a go on my back and décolletage in attempts to remedy my bacne pimple— the next day it was gone! I told my husband and brother immediately and they are sold for life now, too! My husband's back has never looked and felt so smooth and beautiful. When I asked about his results, my brother called it \"alchemy,\" a \"miracle cure.\" \n\nIt's fab for the face, too.",

It might feel like it is sucking up the excess oil in the beginning, but I've been using this for about a month now and my painful cystic acne in my T zone is only getting worse. After doing some research on ingredients I've now learned that alcohol only exacerbates oil production in the long run and makes acne worse. While this product feels like it's working (leaves skin feeling tight and clean), it's going to cause issues down the line. I wouldn't use this product with any skin type! Not good all around.",

This toner does all of that, and it has also reduced my breakouts, which I did not expect! I have been using toners/toning pads for over 10 years (basically, once I started getting bad acne), and none of them- not even the ones with salicylic acid- have been as effective at acne treatment as the Mario Badescu Cucumber Cleansing lotion. It's so natural, refreshing, and effective- I highly recommend it to my acne-prone, oily-combination-skinned ladies (and men). I get the best results when I use it twice a day after cleansing. There are literally cucumber particles in the bottle, too, which I think is awesome.",

        "comments": "This product has alcohol, which is terrible for your skin when used daily! It dries out your skin to the point where ur skin feels the need produce more oil to compensate. I developed terrible under the skin acne that pained like crazy and left horrible scar. On my quest for clear skin this one was a MAJOR setback. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone. It smells nice (cucumber scent) but that doesn't make up for a terrible reaction it gave me. Never again!!!!",
