But why on earth does it need a child proof cap -- the only one in the entire Clinique line, or any line?  The large size has it -- was hoping the smaller bottle would not.  A nuisance when getting ready for bed. Hence the one star deduction. Oherwise a great product.",

It removes eye makeup flawlessly, with ZERO irritation to eyes and skin!! It actually conditions my eyelashes. No blurry eyes!! Forever a user of this Clinique makeup remover. I just got back from vacation, so I just yesterday opened the box. I went to use the remover, and it won't open. It just goes in circles. My construction worker husband, could not open it either. So, I don't know what to do about that. He offered to cut it open, but there's no way I'm doing that. I just  want a cap that works. Hopefully I can get help?",

I have a whole bottom of jelly remover but one swipe of this stuff when I was in ULTA for some lipliner and I was convinced it was worth it.  I had put 10 lines of lipliner on my hand and was giving a tissue with some of this on it. This was wear proof lipliner and this stuff took it off in one swipe. I wasn't going to buy it but while I was standing in line to checkout, there was this little bottle on the carousel thingy. And since....I was going on a plane trip...Well you know the rest. I convinced myself to just buy it. Cashier said it lasts a long time. We'll see",

I told her I started using a waterproof mascara that my normal miscellar water and makeup wipes wouldn't get off, so I needed something better. She said this was the best seller at the store, so I bought the travel size so I could try it out. I'll definitely be buying the full size when this one runs out, it's so good! I use my miscellar water first to remove my eyeshadow and liner, then I use a little bit of this on a new cotton round and just a bit of very gentle rubbing takes everything right off. Including my waterproof mascara that nothing else would get completely off. Plus this leaves everything feeling nice and kind of feels like it is treating my eye area skin too. Love this product.",

I have to use 3 cotton rounds per eye to get my eye makeup off (pencil liner and mascara) with this product.  I have to believe there's a more effective product for this.",
