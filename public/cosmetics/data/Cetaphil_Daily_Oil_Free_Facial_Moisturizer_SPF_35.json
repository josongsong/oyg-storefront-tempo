It did not leave a white hue to my light skin-tone face or to my tan skin-tone friend's face like other sunscreens do. I was out in the sun a lot and my face remained sunburn-free. My only complaint is the pump that dispenses the product. The first time I bought this, the pump simply would not work and I had to unscrew the cap and squeeze out the product. I bought the product another time and occasionally had similar issues with the pump.",

First, it remains pretty visible on skin - no white cast, but it does leave me looking visibly greasy in a way that other moisturizers and even some sunscreen doesn't. This is a non-issue if I am wearing makeup over it, but having to put makeup on takes away from the convenience. The other issue is that it starts coming off my face after 12-16 hours of being on. Once it hits that point, it inevitably ends up stinging my eyes. As long as I put it on late in the morning and wash my face as soon as I get home from work, it is fine but if that is not an option I find myself reaching for something else.",

I decided to give this product a go since the consultant I seen referred me and my skin issues to it. she said it would help me. I have combination skin, some days I'm oily and some days I am very dry with flaky patchy skin, and sometimes I have both oily and dry skin. i do have sensitive skin so basically anything I've tried broke me out snd so I was afraid of that with this product. But I gave it a go and since using this product, I have notice a significant difference from it. my skin is no longer very dry or oily. it feels smooth. no peeling of dry skin patches anymore!!!! I can't tell you how good this feels. I absolutely love this product,  and since it's doing so well for me so far,  I've decided to use their cleansers as well. which I will give my reviews on after using them after awhile.   I have also been using micellar water as well to help clean my face. These 2 products have been good to me so far.  ☺",

        "comments": "I love the product for the convenience of having moisturizer and sunscreen in one bottle, but it comes at a cost that has me not using it as often as I otherwise would. First, it remains pretty visible on skin - no white cast, but it does leave me looking visibly greasy in a way that other moisturizers and even some sunscreen doesn't. This is a non-issue if I am wearing makeup over it, but having to put makeup on takes away from the convenience. The other issue is that it starts coming off my face after 12-16 hours of being on. Once it hits that point, it inevitably ends up stinging my eyes. As long as I put it on late in the morning and wash my face as soon as I get home from work, it is fine but if that is not an option I find myself reaching for something else.",
