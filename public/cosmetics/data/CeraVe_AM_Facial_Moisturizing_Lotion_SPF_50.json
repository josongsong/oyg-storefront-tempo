The bar was set too high with the Cerave ultralight lotion with SPF 30. I love that formula and packaging way more.\n\nUnfortunately it pilled when I tried to use it after my daily serums. So I'll have to save it for days when I'm not using other skin care.",

        "comments": "Offers great protection, no burns in direct sunlight for 2+ hours. However, it can feel heavy and has a strong sunscreen smell. I also have a reaction if I wear it for longer than an hour; the side of my nose becomes red, swollen and itchy and peels for a few days after use. It claims to use a micro-fine zinc, but I only have a reaction like this to certain chemical sunscreens. Need a more transparent description or ingredient list.",
