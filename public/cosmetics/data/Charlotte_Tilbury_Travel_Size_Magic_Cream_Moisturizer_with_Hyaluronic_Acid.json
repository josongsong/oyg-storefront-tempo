This face/neck cream goes on like velvet, my skin feels right away softer and fuller. This is my fourth day and love it very much. It is on the pricey side, but i use little and it covers my face completely. The neck needs a small amount and i apply it were i see lines, which disappear little already. This little jar is a wonder for the skin. Our skin nedds help when we turn 30, so dont wait to get wrinkles and start to take care of your skin. This magic moisturizer delivers and i will get me the full size, maybe a mother's day wish?",
