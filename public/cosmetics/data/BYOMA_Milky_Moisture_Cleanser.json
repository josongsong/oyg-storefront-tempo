The BYOMA Milky Moisture Cleanser has been a delightful discovery for me, a product that not only respects the skin's natural barrier but enhances it, thanks to its innovative formulation. Here's my take on this gentle giant.This Milky Cleanser has earned a permanent spot in my skincare routine. It stands out not just for its ingredient integrity but for its performance and the peace of mind it offers to those of us with sensitive skin. It's a prime example of how skincare can be both gentle and effective, and a reminder that caring for the skin's barrier is the first step towards a healthy, glowing complexion. gifted by byoma",

        "comments": "To start, it is on me for not fully reading the product description before purchasing this product lol. I love all things BYOMA so I kind of blindly bought this cleanser just because I trust and love this brand. Here are the pros: \n1. It removes makeup pretty well with just one wash\n2. it is a great size bottle for the price \n3. It has not caused any adverse reactions for my sensitive, acne-prone, and redness-prone skin\n\nHere are some cons I have noticed: \n1. This one is on me for sure, but I didn't realize it was a cleanser you have to apply to dry skin and then work in with water after. I wasn't necessarily looking for a product like this to be my everyday cleanser. \n2. Although it is a good-sized bottle, you have to use a good 5-6 pumps to get nearly enough product to actually cover your face since it is applied to dry skin first. \n3. I usually have to use a second cleanser after this one because it leaves my skin with an oily film. Maybe this is something good for the skin (IDK), but I don't personally love that because I already struggle with oily skin so I mainly use this as a first cleanse to remove makeup and then use something else as a double-cleanse. I can get by with just using this product at night since I'm sleeping and it doesn't matter if my skin looks a little extra oily lol but I definitely do not use this product alone in the mornings. \n\nI was hoping to use this as my everyday, morning and night cleanser because I am on the hunt for a new one. However, this definitely is more of a one-in-awhile thing for me, personally. I don't hate it because it does remove makeup well and is gentle on my sensitive skin. However, I'm not sure if I will be repurchasing since I kind of have to use a second cleanser after this and that defeats the purpose of why I bought it. If you have dry skin, this might be a great product for you! But since I do not have dry skin, it is not going to be my go-to cleanser. Again, most of this is on me so just be sure to fully read the product description and how to use before buying lol!",
