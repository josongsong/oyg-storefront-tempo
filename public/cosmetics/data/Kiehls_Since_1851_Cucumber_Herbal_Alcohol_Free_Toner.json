However it seems like every time when I receive the bottle, the lid part is broken into two pieces, this is the second time now! I really enjoy the product, but I do have problem wit the quality of the lid. I bought the 16.9 fl. Oz bottle which would last quite a while, with the lid being broken, I really don't like it! I really really hope that next time when I order this product, the lid is good!",
