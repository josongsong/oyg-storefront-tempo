It is more then a little minty, but that could be because of my sensitivity to it. Its also very tingling. If these things dont bother you, give it a try.",

I work at a barn, and ride horses in the dead of winter- and this stuff keeps my chapped lips so so hydrated. Its so moisturizing without a heavy or sticky feeling on the lips. I always get it in clear but it seems like a very buildable consistency. I love how you can actually feel the peptides working to plump and nourish the lips as well woth little tingles at first. Although I wish it came in a different scent to be honest, but I have gotten compliments from some of my sorority sisters saying I smell fresh and minty whenever I wear it. I just wish they had more colors and scents or an unscented clear one and maybe a more minimalist packaging soley for aesthetic purposes. But other than that I genuinely love this product even more so than my kylie gloss, rhode peptide lip tints, and glossier products which I also all love as well.",

This time I had the opportunity to try the Hydra-Peptide Lip Butter from @nudestix through a @bzzagent campaign. Even though the product was at no charge I still want to provide my honest opinion because ethically I can't put my name on something I don't agree with. This hydrating lip butter has a minty/tingly sensation and provides so much hydration. Perfect for the Summer when you want something quick and easy for day to day wear.\n\n#makeupjunkie #cosmetictester #momlife #makeupartist #makeup",

First, I have been so curious about peptide lip products due to a lot of hype on social media and a lot of celebrity skin care lines. I am so happy to try this from Nudeskin, the skincare line from Nudestix because I love and cover their makeup products and love how gentle and non-irritating their products are. When it comes to lip products I want something that's not harsh because I don't want to break out into a rash around my lips or anything. I love that this lip butter has avocado and shes which are ingredients I look out for as they are natural. \n\nMy lips were a lot smoother and this is more than just a \"lip balm\". I call this a lip treatment; while I have used it plenty during the day my favourite time to use it is overnight to really help repair my lips which can get dry and chapped with all the heating indoors during winter. I love the gentle applicator and for the perfect amount comes out with the squeeze tube. It is so hydrating and my lips wake up feeling baby smooth. I got this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I would and already have suggested this to my friends because the price is affordable and contains similar peptides to some higher end products that are a bit too steep in price. This lip butter was so luxurious I consider it on part with comparable higher end lip butters.",

        "comments": "I was genuinely perplexed that so many other reviews gush that this lip gloss isn't sticky and feels good, because honestly, it is actually very sticky, gooey/goopy, heavy and unpleasant feeling on my lips. Additionally, the smell / taste was another signifigant downside/disappointment of this lip gloss for me as well. The \"mint\" taste/odor wasn't enjoyable, and didn't feel good on my lips. There certainly wasn't any lip plumping effect, nor did I ever find it to be moisturizing or softening on my lips. It just doesn't taste good, which is a pretty big deal for me when choosing lip products. It doesn't make lips plump, soft, supple, or feel nice, light or clean. If I really wanted super shiny lips, I would never even consider spending over $22 for this really underwhelming clear lip gloss. I would just buy one of the countless clear super shiny lip glosses that look, feel, taste, and smell significantly better in every way than this one, and will only cost me around $5. \n\nI gave this product two stars rather than one is because I didn't hate it, I just really didn't like anything about it.",
