        "comments": "I'm wondering if maybe the shades are mislabeled as yellow tint should not be in cool shades.  Cool is for pink undertones for a reason.  I first used the shade finder to match the Clinique foundation to another brand that suits my skin tone.  The shade finder was way off!.  It matched me to a shade that I automatically knew would be too dark for my fair complexion so I chose one that was a little lighter in color (CN10).  When I received it, it was also too dark and was yellow but should have had a pink color to it.  I took it back to the store hoping they would swap it for a lighter shade.  The only two options left was CN08 or CN02, according to the website, both of these are cool shades.  With help from an Ulta employee, I chose the CN02.  I took it home, put it on this morning at it is YELLOW!  I can't believe this!  That is the reason that I am giving this foundation a 3 star is because of the yellow tint in the cool shades.  The makeup itself I do like because it lasts all day and helps to control my oil.",

I do find Clinique to be a bit warm in their shades for light/medium warm undertones. At first I was shade matched with CN40 which was a tad too pink. Then shade matched to WN38. Both work but I like the WN38 Stone better even if it's a tad too warm. The foundation is full coverage and I find it does not settle into my lines/wrinkles as long as I don't use too much. I have dry skin and this works for me as long as my face is prepped properly with a good moisturizer.  I put on my face sunscreen moisturizer and follow with Clinique's Dramatically Different Moisturizing lotion.  If I need to during the day I spritz my face with the Moisture Surge spray. I think in the summer months this foundation will be perfect formula for my dry skin - even not in the cooler months it's fine. Hopefully I will be able to find a summer shade next summer. Bonus - this does not irritate my skin or cause me to break out.  A win in my book.",

I thought I would try this product due to boasting about additional benefits to your skin and while I like to hide my imperfections, I would also like my skin to look better without make-up since I'm not an everyday full face of make-up kind of person. I think the problem with this formula is that they are trying to do too many things all in one product and it is throwing off the chemical balance of the product and how it actually looks on the skin. At the end of the day, I am still buying this product because it is a foundation, not a serum and I expect it to look nice. While I had no problems with the look of the Even Better foundation, the Even Better clinical I struggled to make it not look cakey from the first moment I put it on. Through out the rest of the day, it settled into my pores and fine lines and just looked more splotchy the longer I had it on. Just buy the Even better foundation and save yourself the money and headache.",
