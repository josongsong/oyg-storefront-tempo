As another reviewer said, I'd call it a medium-coverage, moisturizing lipstick. The colors are wonderful, I've actually purchased two more. The finish is satin rather than shiny or matte (thank you!!). They aren't greasy, so if your lips are cracked, these won't do it for you. I wear them all day in dry, forced-air heating, and my lips have stayed nice and moisturized.",

        "comments": "I do think it's a good lip product, but not exactly what it claims to be. In the description it claims that it is a tinted lip balm and that you should wipe once for a sheer hint of color. In reality, maybe because it is soft, one wipe will be enough for almost a medium coverage. I was expecting more of a balm with a very transparent tint for a natural look so I was a bit disappointed. If you like a soft, medium coverage lipstick for dry lips this will be great for you.   Color Wise, I ordered memoir, a natural mauve, a good description for the color that came. The photos are also a good representation for the color. Do notice that its a bit brighter, cooler and darker in person then in the photos.  The texture is mostly what I was expecting, it is soft and buttery, and will keep your lips moisturized. The down side is that if you live in a hot country like me it may become softer and a little messy. A good solution is to store it in the refrigerator when you are not taking it with you.  Excuse me for my bad English and I hope it helped!",

        "comments": "I really wanted to love the new balm, but it is just not the same. It sits weirdly on the lips, feels heavy and actually dries my lips, leaving them patchy. I also get a tingly sensation in the lips, I don't know if it's a reaction to some of the ingredients…I still have some left from the old formula and I don't get the same sensations while applying the old tinted lip conditioner. I used to wear 'forever' lipstick everyday. I'd put it on and forget I have anything on my lips, the color lasted longer and it was the only lipstick that could make my lips look alive in a very dry climate. Unfortunately I can't say the same about the new one. It's an ok balm and the colors are still beautiful and flattering, but I wish you didn't change the formula. It was a perfect sheer lipstick and having tried many from other brands, I really think it was the best. Maybe this new product is just not for me. Having said all that, I really like everything else from Ilia and a big fan of the color block lipstick in Rococo.",
