If you are jusy acne prone (like me) then it should not do anything bad to your skin unless you have a sensitivity or are allergic to one of the ingredients.",

I obviously have sensitive skin (eczema) and have never had a problem woth this, same goes with being acne prone. HOWEVER, if you have HORMONAL acne (i dont) then i would NOT recommend this product for you as it contains Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Saccharomyces Ferment, and Lactobacillus Ferment which are known ingredients that commonly cause a breakout im hormonal acne (typically those deep painful pimples). If you are jusy acne prone (like me) then it should not do anything bad to your skin unless you have a sensitivity or are allergic to one of the ingredients.",

And then, I used them for a week and started getting the most horrible painfully breakouts.😕\n\n Although I do have acne prone/sensitive skin, I don't usually break out, unless there's an skin irritant ingredients. And welp this has a few! (At least for my skin) \nThis had me breaking out so badly, I stopped using it until my skin clears up again. \nIt's not for evey skin type, read the ingredients list before buying. Make sure those ingredients are okay for your skin needs.",
