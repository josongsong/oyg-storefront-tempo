It doesn't clear out sebaceous filaments or pore gunk like other oil cleansers i have tried. It does a decent job removing foundation and sunscreen but it performs poorly with eye makeup like waterproof eyeliner and mascara. I ALWAYS end up with panda eyes and yes I do emulsify it before washing off. Definitely would not purchase again since it does neither of the things I neither of the things that I need it to do. You can get much better for the price honestly.",

This oil just slips around & doesnt break down any makeup. When you try to wash it off it doesnt move and leaves thee worst greasy film. By the time I went to dry my face my towels were covered with oil & leftover makeup that this did literally nothing to remove. \nThank gooodness my go-to came back in stock soon after because yikes..",

Skipping the chemistry lesson has made my face angry; I haven't had pimples and breakouts like this since my teens.\nFirst, I have combination leaning-oily skin prone to clogged pores, breakouts, and acne, which means I really needed something lower/noncomedogenic. This contains soybean and sesame oil, which don't always play nice with clogging pores.\nApplication was very runny, but definitely felt effective at clearing sebaceous filaments. It didn't emulsify very well (tried a few different ways) and after rinsing for several min, I still felt oil. Didn't see a difference in breakouts with a double-cleanse.\nIt smells nice? A very light, sweet scent.",

When I get a oil cleanser I want to be able to have it rinse off clean with absolutely no film or weird texture when I use this stuff. I literally have to find an exfoliating brush to get the remainder of it off. Even my second cleanse doesn't get the film off it's so gross. I love earth, Harbor sunshine dew and biossance pre cleansing oil. Those two are nice and thin and they take my sunscreen, (which is the Isdin sunscreen and is extremely hard to get off) right off with no problem. There's no film left behind and I wouldn't even have to use the second cleanse if I was in a hurry",

It effectively breaks up make-up, sunscreen/products and it feels nice to rub around my face. I like how it gets slightly milky when I wet my face after loosening all the gunk. I follow with a foaming cleanser and it is easy to remove that way. The smell is very natural and faint. The only reason i took a star is because it is very runny so it can get messy if you aren't careful and I have found that the bottle pump does leak a little.

I fell in love with cleansing oils after how efficiently they removed all my makeup. \n\nThis cleansing oil works just as well as the other two I've tried. It removes all my makeup with little effort, smells nice, and leaves my skin supple and soft. \n\nThe only downside is that you HAVE to double cleanse (aka use a foaming cleanser after the oil cleanser) to remove it. The box for this product even recommends you combine it with their black sugar scrub before washing off. I didn't do that because I am not about to damage my skin with a sugar scrub. \n\nOverall it's really good, just takes an extra product to completely remove the leftover oil.",

I bought this when my other cleansing oil was about half finished so I didn't need it for months actually (why do I do this) and only just tried it yesterday. I knew from the very first use that I had messed up. This is a lesson to me not to buy new products unless I'm going to use them within the return period, or at least test them out. Rather than emulsifying and turning milky when I add water this almost gets thicker on my face and it takes a wash cloth and a double-cleanse to get it off. I try not to waste stuff but the idea of being stuck with this cleanser until it's finished is a little depressing. I might try to see if someone else wants it and just go back to my original oil cleanser. Hanskin oil cleanser never did me wrong like this, lol. I still love the Klairs supple toner to pieces, fragranced version even, but this one was a dud for me. I have to go wash my face in a bit and honestly, I think I'll use the ponds cold cream I have on hand and a cotton round to get my work makeup off, because that oil cleanser is such a pain. Definitely not for me.",
