This spray has bladderwrack, which is a type of seaweed that is known for its anti-aging, dark spot reducing, and detoxifying properties. Gardenia helps moisture retention and reduce redness. Aloe soothes and calms irritated skin. The spray is slightly rose-scented, not from a synthetic fragrance but from natural rose extract. So if your skin gets irritated by perfume and fragrancy products, as mine does, this spray should be okay for your skin! Rose extract is also good for brightening and firming skin. \n\nI find that this spray sets makeup well and is a good mid-day moisturizer for my dry patch flareups. I also spray it on before moisturizing at night for those extra dry days. \n\nMario Badescu's products have helped me so much; I am forever loyal to this brand. Consistent and simple packaging that doesn't hike up prices and high quality, natural ingredients is why I stick to this brand.",

I was very annoyed at how different it was from the old one once i sprayed it. I saved my old bottle, compared, and noticed the ingredients are not the same! The ingredients listed on ultas website ARE NOT updated, BEWARE IF YOU ARE SHOPPING ONLINE!\n--compare to ingredients listed on site--\nACTUAL INGREDIENTS:\nAqua (water), propylene glycol, aloe leaf juice, fucus vesiculosus extract, gardenia florida fruit extract, polysorbate 20, caprylyl glycol, hexylene glycol, parfum (fragrance), phenoxyethanol, sodium chloride, Cl 17200 (Red 33), Cl 42090 (blue)\n\nNO ROSEWATER AT ALL??!! Yet on the front of the bottle it says it has rosewater? The smell is different as well! \nI'd also like to add that they changed the spray nozzle  which i hate! Sprays way too much product!\nSadly, this WAS a holy grail item. I will not be repurchasing!",
