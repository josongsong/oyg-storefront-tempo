I'm not sure what could have caused it as the product is supposed to be hypoallergenic, which I sought out specifically after I found out I may have MCAS, though I've never reacted to a face wash like this before. Even if I hadn't had a reaction, this was barely scrubby at all. Maybe I got a bad one, but I was disappointed.",

My husband, for one, would appreciate it as I'm sure alot of other well groomed men would.",

This is the first wash I've used that makes my skin feel smooth soft and clean without being dried out or sensitive. I'm not a huge fan of scented things but this works so well for me that I'm not bothered in the slighted. It's a light scent and fades quickly. I follow this up with Olay Classic Unscented lotion and I'm loving the combo. I haven't been using it long enough to notice a change  with my acne but it hasn't gotten worse so I'm hopeful it'll help clear things up a bit with continued use.",
