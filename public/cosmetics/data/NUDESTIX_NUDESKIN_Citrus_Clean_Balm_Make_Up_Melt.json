The smell is really nice, it's super fresh and clean. The only drawback for me is that it can be a bit stinging if it gets in your eyes because of the citrus which, since it's a makeup remover it probably will. Not the biggest deal if you're careful but something to be aware of.",

But as I've aged, my skin has gotten drier & the makeup removers & cleansers I was used to using became to harsh/drying. I've been using Elemis Cleansing Balm for quite a while now & love it; but it's pricey & the jar just isn't convenient for me. I've been using Nudestix makeup for ~2 years now & absolutely love it so I decided to give their skin care line a try...so glad I did! This balm is wonderful! Smells amazing (1 of the reasons I loved Elemis over the Clinique Cleansing Balm), doesn't irritate my skin, didn't cause any breakouts....my makeup - including eye makeup - was easily removed. My skin feels soft & clean. LOVE the tube! So much better than a big jar. Also love that I can buy this in a travel sized kit.",

It is important to me to ensure that every bit of makeup is taken off at the end of the night so I'm always on the hunt for new cleansing products to keep in my arsenal. This 4 in 1 by NudeStix did not disappoint! First off, I love the packaging. The pink is super cute and aestheically pleasing. Plus, I prefer tubes compared to little jars that I always lose the spoon for and end up scooping up with my fingers, which is so unsanitary. So, the packaging matters (Plus the box it comes in is biodegradable! Stuff like that totally aligns with my values). Next thing I really enjoy is the smell. I actually love scents in skincare and this one is just lovely. That combined with the balms silky texture makes for a big win. The best thing about this product is that it is 4 things in 1. I love a product that can multitask. And it comes through on each of those 4 claims. It effectively removes makeup, it cleanses the skin beautifully, my skin felt noticably softer and I could see the little extra brightness with regular use. Also, what was really nice is that a little product went a nice long way and it was so easy and quick to use. My preferred way to use it as a first step in a double cleanse as that is just my routine when it comes to cleaning my face. And it is completely the perfect product to use for that. It is 100% comparable to other products on the market and I think slightly cheaper then some of the more popular brands. My sole negative to this cleanser is that it did slightly irriate my eyes sometimes. I think that may have to do with the citrus extracts but as long as I was careful, it didn't happen. Besides that, this is definitely on my new favourite cleansing balms and I will definitely be purchasing a tube when mine runs out",

        "comments": "This product was alright, generally, but at the end of the day, it felt like a barrier to my serum routine, and burned my eyes when I tried to wash it off. \n\nPackaging: The product itself is packaged in a tube that holds its form well. It was easy to squeeze and held its shape, but I worried that when the tube got to the bottom, it might crack and leak. This tube is packaged in a clear plastic case that appears to only serve the purpose in telling that the clear plastic case was biodegradable. \n\nThe Product: Yellow in colour with a soft wax texture. It smells kind of chemically lemon, like cleaning product. \n\nApplication: Went on smooth and actually dissolved the makeup! Even the waterproof liner and mascara. I was actually impressed. It did its job. \n\nAfter: The instructions said you could leave it as is after rubbing it in or washing it off with warm water. Considering I have a serum routine, I decided to wash and continue with my daily regimen. This was a problem. When I washed it off with warm water, it made the skin around my eyes burn and go red. It was completely fine if I didn't add water (and the following night, I just left it on, and while it didn't burn my eyes, it did feel greasy and I didn't like that). Adding serums on top of this thick, waxy layer seemed like a waste of money. \n\nFinal thoughts: Would this be good for my daily wash? No. I don't think so. It feels like it creates a barrier to the additional products. When it would be good is when I'm traveling, as it would be less likely to leak in my bag than other cleansers. If I'm flying out for a few days, and didn't want to take my whole routine, this would be a nice option for a few days.",
