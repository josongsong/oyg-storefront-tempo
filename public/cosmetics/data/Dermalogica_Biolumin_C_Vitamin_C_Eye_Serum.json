I pair it with the Good Molecules brightening eye cream for the bad days and they both go on wonderfully together. Would definitely recommend.

This serum is literally the only product I have ever used that lightened up the circles. I keep it in my mini beauty fridge to keep it cold, and I press the bottle very lightly to get a half-pea sized drop for both eyes. BE CAREFUL WHEN PRESSING THE BOTTLE because a huge glob WILL come out and that's a total waste. This product lightened my under-eyes to the point where I had to select a different shade of concealer. It's amazing! I wait a minute or so for the product to absorb, then I follow up with an eye cream, day and night.",

I was on the fence for awhile and skeptical about how many people were gifted it.\n\nI've had issues with dark circles my whole life but they've been worse the last few years with age. I was amazed at the difference this has made with brightening under my eyes. I've been using it since July and I still love it. It doesn't make up for a night with little sleep but overall my eyes are brighter. I've also noticed that it's lightened the 2 dark sun spots I have next to my eye. I do feel it works and have recommended it to my friends and family. I only use a small pea amount under each eye at night. Squeeze slowly bc it has a tendency come out in a big glob which is then wasteful. I'm not sure how it would look under makeup but from the way it dries on my skin, I believe it would be fine. I did see some negative reviews about the way it dried but I'm wondering if there's an interaction with other products.\n\nFull disclosure: I've also been using this with Sunday Riley's Good Genes which also contributes to lightening dark spots.",

        "comments": "This really helped with my wrinkles around my eyes. I mean you will never make a wrinkle disapear without some help from a doctor. Until i can afford that , this fits the bill. Yet pricey , a tiny bad goes a long way. it absorbs fast , no greasy feel . It works for me as I am starting to notice the worry lines. Its not a potion but it really smooths out the lines making you 10 years younger.....as long as you treat your body right.",

I've been using this Dermalogica Biolumin-C Eye Serum for a few weeks now and i have to say im pretty happy with my results! The skin around my eyes feel so nice, hydrated, they're also noticeably brighter and overall look more awake! I love the fact that this serum doesn't cause any irritation what so ever, as it is hard for me to find products for the eye area that don't cause issues but with this eye serum I've had no issues with irritation at all which im very happy about! The texture is very nice and it has a lightweight consistency that absorbs right into the skin! Overall, since using the product I can definitely say my under eye area is much more healthy looking, I will definitely be purchasing a tube before I run out of it as I love the brightening effect I'm seeing with this Dermalogica Eye Serum!",

        "comments": "I'm a married 46 year old lady. We have two boys 6 & 4. I've always used a night time lotion before bed every night. I've tried many serum's over the years with no eval. Even though, I haven't used any new eye serums in the past couple of years. After some consideration, I decided to give dermalogica a try with an open mind. After the 4th night, I began to have some burning underneath my eyes. As most people know that use eye serums, they all tend to burn a little bit after a couple of applications. So after the 5th night, the burning picked up considerably. It wasn't intolerable. I figured that I had applied just a little too much on that night. So, wanting to give it my best shot I decided to go ahead and continue to use it. On the 6th night, I was careful to make sure I applied the correct amount. The burning continued and the burning increased and became painful. I decided at that moment to discontinue use. After a week, I developed what look like a bump under my left eye. It was really big and not anything that you could hide by makeup. I was terrified to even leave the house. It's been over three weeks and I still have the bump, even if it is a bump. It's been very painful, needless to say. For me to recommed the serum as a product that works as described, I cannot at this time. I cannot say that I recognized a decrease in fine lines and etc., but I chalk that up to not being able to use the product as recommended due to the issues I experienced. I would suggest that you read other reviews regarding the effectiveness of dermalogica. Wish I could be of more help. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.",
