It recently stopped heating, so, loving it, I decided to buy this one because it was the same but with black plates. I got it home and turned it on to get ready for an event and it wouldn't heat up past the 1 setting and the red light just kept blinking. I waited 20 minutes and it still didn't heat up any. I went to exchange it and got another one. Used it once and then the same thing. I would not recommend buying unless you want to be disappointed and make 4 trips to Ulta to get something that doesn't even work.",

I do also find that it doesn't close all the way when trying to do curls. So, the hair will fall out from between the plates when trying to finish a curl. Lastly, the plates extend all the way out so it you're not extremely careful you will burn your hands and melt your combs. Again, it works but I would not recommend or buy it again.",

Over the years, the ceramic is still so smooth that I have not experienced any snagging. Its controllable temp allows to adjust to your needs. And the best part is this straightner creates the large curls I always love the way that I want it.\nIts design is sleek and unique. Simple and easy to use. \nMy first review and wanted to take the time and say thank you. Its on sale and my straightner is still working perfectly fine other wise Id snag this deal.

I have had everything from CHI, Remington, and hot tools but I am so thankful I came across this affordable titanium coated one. I just used it for the first time and I am in love with it. No pulling on hair, glides very easily, and is easy on the eyes. The only thing I had a problem with was fly aways, but that is probably because I need some heat protectant or was curling my hair with it. \nIf buying a titanium straightener isn't in your budget, this is the best straightener you will get for a nice price!",

However the plates do not close evenly across the iron. The only place the plates touch are at the tip of the iron, when you put hair through the plates it will still work like it is supposed to but can cause snagging or pulling of hair. Its easy to avoid as long as you're aware of the issue. If plates made even contact it would be the perfect tool.",
