I've had to take it to the garage in the middle of the night several times. \nSo yes, I will buy another one, but was very disappointed in this one.",

We tried different USB plugs and regular plugs with different adapters and nothing worked. She reached out to Michael Todd Beauty (only email, no phone number 🚩) and only received an auto reply and nothing further. After looking further into reviews she filed a complaint with the BBB. Thankfully ULTA was amazing and allowed me to return it as it was within the holiday return window even though she had discarded the box on Christmas morning (had all the components and paperwork, just not the box). The 1 start is for the non-working appliance manufacturer and no correlation to ULTA.",

I got ANOTHER replacement and I open the package just to find out they've sent me a device that literary will not charge. I CAN'T MAKE THIS UP! I've already been through THREE (yes, three) petite devices in specifically the rose gold color all of which stopped working/charging after a few months. This product is trash. I can honestly say I never even leave reviews, but I made sure I left one for this CRAPPY device. It's also important to note when I order this back in May of  2020 it was the ONLY color that didn't come with a charging stand/base which I thought was completely strange. Then A YEAR later the company decides to discontinue the original device I got in rose gold. NOW all of a sudden the company sells a new upgraded version a year later it with a charging stand/base and claims it was just for \"aesthetics\" purposes. My older sister has a soniclear elite that has been working for the last 4 YEARS, she only had to get one replacement that's lasted about another 4 YEARS. PLEASE SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY WITH THIS DEVICE!",
