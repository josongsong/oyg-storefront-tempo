The Peachgasm is very subtle and I personally add another peach cream blush with it to amp up the intensity. Pinkgasm is amazing on its own and looks great. I love the shimmer they give and that they arent drying to my skin; also does not settle into any pesky fine lines that creep up. Beautiful product and although it's a bit pricey, its so worth it!!",

        "comments": "I recently had the pleasure of trying out the Charlotte Tilbury Pinkgasm Beauty Light Wand and I must say, it exceeded all my expectations. The product was sent to me as a gift for my honest review. This product is truly a game-changer in the world of highlighters.\n\nFirst and foremost, let's talk about the shade Pinkgasm. It is a stunning, universally flattering pink hue with the perfect amount of shimmer. It adds a beautiful, ethereal glow to my skin that makes me feel like a glowing goddess. Whether I'm going for a natural, everyday look or a more glamorous evening look, this shade complements any makeup look effortlessly.\n\nThe packaging of the Pinkgasm Beauty Light Wand is also worth mentioning. It comes in a sleek, rose gold tube that looks so luxurious and sophisticated. The twist-up mechanism is convenient and ensures that I dispense just the right amount of product every time. The brush applicator is soft and allows for precise application, making it easy to achieve that perfect, lit-from-within look.\n\nOne of the standout features of this product is its incredible formula. It is lightweight, blendable, and buildable, allowing me to customize the intensity of the highlight. It effortlessly glides onto my skin, leaving behind a seamless, radiant finish. I love how it doesn't emphasize any texture or pores, making my skin look flawless.\n\nAnother aspect that I appreciate about this beauty light wand is its long-lasting power. Once applied, it stays put throughout the day, without fading or smudging. I don't have to worry about constant touch-ups, which is a huge plus for me, especially during busy days.\n\nFurthermore, the Pinkgasm Beauty Light Wand is infused with hyaluronic acid and rosehip oil, which adds a nourishing and hydrating element to the product. It feels like I'm not only enhancing my makeup but also taking care of my skin at the same time. This is a major win for someone like me who values skincare as much as makeup.\n\nIn conclusion, the Charlotte Tilbury Pinkgasm Beauty Light Wand is a must-have in anyone's makeup collection. Its stunning shade, impeccable formula, and long-lasting power make it a standout highlighter. If you're looking to achieve that coveted, radiant glow, I highly recommend giving this product a try. It's worth every penny and is sure to become a staple in your makeup routine.",

I'm more of a minimalist \"no makeup\" makeup gal, so this is not something I see myself using casually, as it is quite shimmery and intense, but it will definitely pack a punch on a night out. It has a very orange/red undertone (I'm sure my fair complexion plays a big part in this) and is loaded with little glitter particles, but the payoff isn't as intimidating as you'd think - it's actually pretty sheer and buildable. I found the product was heavily absorbed by a Beauty Blender, and was too streaky to be blended with my finger. A soft foundation brush seemed to do the trick!",
