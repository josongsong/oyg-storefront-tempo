This product is great and worth every penny! Try it if you are in need of a product that will lightly moisturize and give you a hint of colour that lasts. I highly recommend this balm! I cannot wait to try more colours though!",

You make good products, Clinique, but your color representations on the website are WAY off. And I've checked them out on multiple monitors. At this point, I won't order anything new until I have time to see it in person at a counter. Unfortunately, I never have time to go to the counter; that's why I buy online!",
