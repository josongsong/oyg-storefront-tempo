        "comments": "I love this moisturizer. I had originally purchased the slam dunk moisturizer but felt it didn't match my skincare needs. I knew they had two other options for moisturizers and because they have, what I feel like is a great breakdown and explanation of each moisturizer, I was able to narrow it down to this one, the cloud surf. I have sensitive combo skin now (I used to have normal skin and didn't need any attention or fuss ) but just in the last two years I've been working on keeping my newly developed hormonal acne under control, so finding a good moisturizer was critical. I had high hopes for this one because for me it checked all my boxes: lightweight, unscented, no dyes, \"clean\", extremely affordable, AND there were over 500 reviews with overwhelmingly positive reactions to the product.. \nAfter trying it I found Cloud Surf to be lightweight, it absorbs well, it's easy to layer with my other products and I feel like it sufficiently moisturizes without clogging up my skin. I've been using these products for a little over a year now and I'm very happy. I actually just recently recommended a handful of these products to a friend of mine (along with a few others that I swear by) because she has sensitive skin and I genuinely think these products are worth trying. I know all people are different, all skin is different, everyone responds to things differently. But if you're looking for some new basic skincare products, products to create a simple routine or you want all the steps, Bubble is a great place to start. Their products make up 80% of my daily routine. Bubble makes up the majority of my in-between steps. And my skin looks GREAT now. It took a minute to find what worked for me, but I really like these products and I will use them as long as the formulas don't change and/or cheapen. I even just this last week recommended this moisturizer to a friend of mine and she also struggles with combo acne prone skin and scarring. Some of these products have little fixed some of my discoloration and scarring from the hormonal acne from two years ago. Totally worth trying.",

        "comments": "The layout of my skin is as follows: dry, sensitive, acne prone. What I CANT use: PGA, HA, AHA's, Niacinamide, Shea Butter. After thorough research, I bought this product. I've been using this product for exactly 22 days (April 6th 2025). Within these 22 days my skin had had a massive improvement with my acne. Skin texture is smoother and more even. HOWEVER, something in this product is irritating my lips horrendously. Within the past 22 days I've had 4 irritation bumps appear just on my lips. After the first one appeared on April 15th, I immediately scheduled a visit with my dermatologist fearing the bump was something more sinister. Everything sinister was ruled out. She stated that it was likely a fordyce spot or a bump from something irritating my lip. At the time, I didnt equate the bump to the moisturizer. It went away after 5 days. But then another one appeared just two days later and I was at a loss. Ive NEVER had any issues with my\nLips. I couldnt understand why all of the sudden my lips looked like that. Terrified, i cautiously put on this moisturizer in the morning, avoiding my lips, and I havent had any appear for a week and a half. Yesterday, in a rush I applied this moisturizer and forgot to be careful around my lips. I woke up this morning with TWO bumps on my lips… unfortunately confirming that this product is the culprit of the bumps. I will be returning.",
