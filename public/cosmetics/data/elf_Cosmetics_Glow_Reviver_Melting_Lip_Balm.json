I didn't expect much about this lip balm since I didn't have good experiences with other brands' ones ( even with famous brand), but this Glow Reviver Melting Lip Balm has blown me away. It's not too sticky, and it does its job that hydrate my lips so well. My lips are super dry and there has been no lip balms that work on me so far, but this lip balm is a BOMB. Wild cherry is not my favorite color, however I would love to order different shades. It also has nice smell and design is easy for blending. You can put small or big amount of lip balm depends on how dark you want the shade stays on your lips. Thank you BzzAgent and E.l.f Cosmetics for letting my try this great product.",

It is not strong but I rather prefer no scent at all.\n\nIf I am going to compare this to the other products that I am currently using (which are natural and uses natural ingredients)? I choose my current natural lip balm. \n\nIs there's any Benefit of using this product? I don't think so, maybe it's a kind of lip balm tube that is easy to bring and doesn't take up space. 🤷‍♀️\n\nWould I buy or purchase this product? No!\n\nWould I recommend this to my family and friends? No! But if that certain person doesn't mind about bad ingredients? Then it's their freedom to purchase what they want.",
