They take makeup off pretty well. My face isn't sensitive at all, but these make my skin feel like its burning. Not intensely, but its not subtle either. I'll probably use the rest of these for my armpits or something. Not buying again",

I originally bought them for my face but after realizing how they made my face feel like I just had a fresh washed face I tried them on my pits. My tiny B.O I had was 100% gone. To really put them to the test, I had my husband try them on his pits (he works hard labor so his white Ts get stained with his B.O and you can still smell it even after washing his clothes! He tried these on a hot and sticky day and his B.O went from stingy my nose to basically nothing! We both have eczema prone and very sensitive skin (most products make us break out) and he gets eczema really bad in the summer from sweating. Beekman's products are the only ones we use now. Now that we have these, we use them throughout the day to take a mini shower until we can take a real shower and it has changed our lives! I use mine at work (corporate work attire is so easy to sweat in during a hot summer). Now I no longer have to worry about keeping my arms down when I start sweating and the deodorant isn't helping lol.",

I used a wipe to take off my makeup and just kinda clean it before I would workout, so I could save washing it and putting my antibiotic on my face later. I did try and wash it with a wipe before my antibiotic and it was a horrible decision. Lesson learned, but after that I used it regularly, and It made my face incredibly sticky and dry as could be. I put moisturiser on after it dried, but it was still sticky and dry. Well, this morning I was putting on makeup (eye shadow) and had excess makeup so I wiped it down with one of these and I had huge red marks under and outside of my eyes. I've had goat milk before and had no problems, so it isn't a new known allergy. I'm keeping them to let my boyfriend try, since we also have the bar of soap. Would not recommend to a friend to order one, just use a few of mine to try in case it does to them what it did to me and they wasted their money. I am incredibly disappointed.",
