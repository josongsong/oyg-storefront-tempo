My bad.  This irritates the eyes so terribly and should not be used anywhere near them.  But there's more.\nSo that I would not be out the money I shelled out for this, I tried using it on hands.  It only makes dry skin worse.  It doesn't even apply smoothly.  Balm?  There is nothing balmy about this.  In my opinion, this product should be launched into space, or at least into the rubbish bin.  My advice:  Don't listen to the positive recommendations.",

The new version makes the foundation chalky and dry.  So disappointed that a product intended for dry and sensitive skin now makes my dry, sensitive skin even more dry and more sensitive.",
