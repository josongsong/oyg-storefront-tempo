I loved the charcoal but I always felt as there was a film of soap on my face like I didn't wash it off completely, when I did. I love how this face wash is clear and fragrance free, which is awesome if you have allergies and any heavy fragrance makes you stuffier. You don't need much, I use roughly a dime sized amount. Because of that, you get longer use out of the face wash. It doesn't dry skin out and makes it soft.",

I loved the charcoal but I always felt as there was a film of soap on my face like I didn't wash it off completely, when I did. I love how this face wash is clear and fragrance free, which is awesome if you have allergies and any heavy fragrance makes you stuffier. You don't need much, I use roughly a dime sized amount. Because of that, you get longer use out of the face wash. It doesn't dry skin out and makes it soft.",
