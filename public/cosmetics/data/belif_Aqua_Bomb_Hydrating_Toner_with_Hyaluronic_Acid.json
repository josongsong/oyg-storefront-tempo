Five years later, I cannot stop buying this and I hope it's never discontinued. This helps hydrate my skin but it's the best for prepping my skin to help absorb my other product (which I had an issue with before incorporating this product into my skincare routine). \nI have combo skin leaning on the dryer side. Highly recommend giving it a try! \n\np.s There is fragrance in this product so if you have sensitive skin you might want to be cautious trying this.",

I have been using Origins mega mushroom treatment lotion for years before moisturizing because it adds a nice layer of moisture on my skin but I was almost to the bottom of the bottle and llately I've been feeling like I could find something more effective. I've tried other products from Belif and never been disappointed, always happy with the results and never anticipating them to be as good as they ended up. This toner is no exception- my skin actually glows, it isn't irritating or drying and a little bit goes a very long way. If only I had found it years ago!",

I was sort of hesitant to use it at first because i have sensitive skin, but i'm glad i tried it anyway because it hasn't bothered my skin at all :)",

        "comments": "I'll start by saying I typically don't use toners because they are too drying. I have been using Origins mega mushroom treatment lotion for years before moisturizing because it adds a nice layer of moisture on my skin but I was almost to the bottom of the bottle and llately I've been feeling like I could find something more effective. I've tried other products from Belif and never been disappointed, always happy with the results and never anticipating them to be as good as they ended up. This toner is no exception- my skin actually glows, it isn't irritating or drying and a little bit goes a very long way. If only I had found it years ago!",

        "comments": "The 3rd listed ingredient is \"Alcohol Denat.\"… while yes this ingredient can be used for *some* toners, it can cause excessive dryness and disturb the natural barrier on your skin. It can also cause breakouts, skin irritation, and redness.\n\nWith this being the 3rd ingredient, stay away from this toner if you have dry skin. \n\nThere are some good products from this brand but just stay away from this one. This is a miss for sure.",
