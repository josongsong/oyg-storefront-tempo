It didn't work for my skin, I do have combination/not sensitive skin but this did break me out. After looking at the ingredients, it makes sense considering there are multiple oils & butters in it, including: jojoba oil, macademia oil, shea butter, etc. If you tolerate products with those ingredients then I absolutely recommend it but if not, I'd give something else a try 🌟",

The product itself is great, but for the price, and the size of the packaging… I would expect there to be more product. I feel like it's a little bit of a rip off to pay so much for so little no matter how good it is. If you look at the size of the packaging, you would expect there to be a lot of bronzer and blush but the value just isn't there. Again, the product itself is fine, but there are a lot of products that are decent dupes for less money and more product.",

That being said when i receieved dibs in my FFF box, I was excited to try a two in one product. I fell in love with the simplicity of it. I felt so pretty while still feeling natural. The formula itself isnt cakey, sticky, or heavy. Its completely lightweight & allows mistake. Blends into your skin and is buildable!! To this day if im not going to a fancier function, ill put on dibs & then some mascara and i feel like me! I've recommended this product to now dozens of people in my circle & shared on social media. I love dibs, you should try this asap!",

When I got this stick during the previews, I was skeptical until I saw on Instagram all the people using it in place of lipstick. I'm fairly light skin so the bronzer isn't for all over in the fall but I've been playing around with it as a contour and it WORKS too. Love that there are two sides of this because I would buy even if it was just a great lipstick replacement.",

Maybe because the brush and preferred color has been out of stock for so long is part of the problem. If that's the case, stop encouraging influencers to push people to buy colors that aren't ideal as well as a product that a specific brush works for if it's always sold out.   I'd love to say it's user error because that would mean this greasy stick has salvaging potential. This is coming from someone who was a makeup artist for over 15 years as well as watched a ton of \"tutorials\" for this duo stick. I bought an eyeliner and lipliner as wall and they're all equally trash. I so wanted all let alone any of these products to work cause o love my girl Courtney. These flops are leaving me with major trust issues now for anything Dibs or CS sponsored. So sad!",
