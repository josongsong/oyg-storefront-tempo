        "headline": "too $$$ for iron that always gets hair caught in corners",
        "comments": "I wanted to love this flat iron but the inability to adjust the temp can be frustrating when it goes off memory if you didn't use exactly as needed from start to finish. Worst thing is the design causes your hair to get caught in the corners of the floating plates and pulls it out especially when you're doing multiple passes to one section of hair which is necessary to achieve the desired look. I blow dry my hair first with a round brush and then use this to achieve the shiny frizz free flat ironed look that normally lasts for several days but with this flat iron I have to run very thin sections of hair through the iron at least 10 times to straighten and shine and if I take too much hair in a section then it won't hold. This makes it extremely time consuming when you have a lot of hair. Even if I take my time with very small sections and run it through 10 times a section it will still fall out the minute I enter any type of humid environment. It is pretty durable and seems like it will hold up for several years but I doubt it will last 12 years like my previous flat iron made by another co. for the price it  had better! really thought this was gonna just blow me away but it didn't and I've been flat ironing my curls for over 20 years and have used only professional grade irons. it is better than most but not as good as I expected or it could be. the hair getting caught should have been fixed prior to mass production by simply testing the product first.",

I did love how fast it heated up and how well I could straighten and curl my hair with it. Of course my previous purchase was not tied to my Ulta account, so I have no proof of purchase to try to replace under manufacturer warranty (my fault). My flat iron prior to this one was a Babyliss that lasted me 12 years. I should have stuck with that brand, although the reviews from the current irons they offer are not promising.",

        "comments": "To give the ghd Platinum + Styler a fair shot, I did my normal routine when I decide to flat iron my hair.  It's usually because I washed my hair the night before and was too tired to blow it out which happens.  😂  I used a detangling spray on my damp hair after washing and let it air dry.  I slept with my air dried hair up in a loose top knot. For reference, my hair is at about a 2c, is thick stubborn and very prone to frizz. It's also color treated all over along with balayage highlights.  That mess you see is usually the state of my hair before I style it in the morning.\n\nI plugged it in and pressed the power button located in the inner portion of the flat iron.  The button lit up and made a sound indicating that it is on.  The light indicated that it was ready for use instantly which was a surprise to me.  This styling tool seemed very ergonomically designed and felt good around my hand, causing me not to strain my wrists which suffers from carpal tunnel syndrome.  It was also weighted but not heavy.\n\nBefore using the ghd Platinum +, I sectioned my hair and sprayed each section with a heat protectant right before I passed it with the flat iron. \n\nMy main observations during usage was that the flat iron was not incredibly hot like some previous ones I have used even in or around the temperature that the ghd platinum + remains in (365 degrees) and my hair cools down to the touch after each pass almost immediately.  There was no sizzle and smoke coming out of my hair so it was incredibly gentle in heat but took only two passes to achieve the results I wanted.  The hair straighteners that I've used in the past took higher heat and more passes to get my hair straight which I know definitely causes major damage in my already vulnerable color treated hair.  It took me about 25 mins to finish my entire head of hair when I normally take about 30-40 mins with other flat irons which was a very pleasant surprise.  After usage, I applied hair oil to my mid lengths and ends for additional moisture, shine and to curb away the frizzies. \n\nMy takeaway based on my experience and the state of my hair:  If you have hair that is constantly taking a beating from heat styling, color and bleach then you should get this flat iron.  It's gentler on your hair and doesn't require much effort like other leading hair tool brands in or around the same price point.  You get smooth results with minimal passes and it's very easy to handle while using because it was designed to fit nicely on your hand without causing strain from the urge to squeeze the plates too hard together through your hair.  In the long run, your hair will thank you.  I highly recommend it and will be using this from this day forward!",
