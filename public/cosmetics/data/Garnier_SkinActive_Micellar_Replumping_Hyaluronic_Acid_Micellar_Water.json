I'm very interested in skincare and generally follow a 7 step Korean beauty routine. I also workout every morning so I usually wash my face AFTER the workout so I don't \"waste\" all of my other beauty products that way. I still wanted to do some sort of cleansing step BEFORE my workout to make sure my skin is clean before my pores begin opening up when I sweat though. This micellar water is PERFECT for that! It cleanses away all the dirt, impurities, and oil that built up on my skin while sleeping through the night and leaves me feeling so clean! I have dry skin so if I don't follow up with a moisturizer or serum right after washing my face, my skin gets super dry, tight, and irritable. However, the hyaluronic acid and aloe in this product leaves my skin moisturized so I don't need to immediately follow up with any other products! I can just this micellar water and go! It has been such a relief to find this product and incorporate it into my beauty routine! I always feel so reassured that my skin is PROPERLY cleansed and hydrated after using it.",

I found that this did a pretty good job of removing most of my long wear make up after 12 hours of wear. I will say that it didn't completely remove all of my make up, and while this is no rinse, I did feel the need to rinse my face. I did notice that my skin felt rather dry and tight afterwards which I didn't love. For a product that contains hyaluronic acid I was really surprised that my skin felt so dry and then I needed moisturization immediately. I do think this is a great first cleansing step in a skin care routine.",
