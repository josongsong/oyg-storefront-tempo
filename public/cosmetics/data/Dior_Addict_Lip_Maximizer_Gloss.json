        "comments": "I received Dior Addict Lip Maximizer 001- delicate pink from Influenster and Dior for free for my honest opinion.\nThe Dior lip maximizer comes in a spectacular feminine recyclable lip gloss tube. Complete with the brand's signature mirrored lid and a CD monogram engraved on the top. The foam doe-foot applicator is a dream to work with. It's wide enough to cover my lips and allows the product to glide evenly across my lip area. When pulling the applicator out the foam tip has just the right amount of product to put on your lips.\nAfter applying the product it feels quite cooling on the lips and has a slightly minty fragrance. I surda felt some tingling on my lips but not much. The lip maximizer didn't make my lips plump up at all. But I love it for its unparalleled shine, non-sticky finish and intense nourishment that seems to last far longer than any other gloss I've come across. I think that's because it's infused with cherry oil and hyaluronic acid. The color was such a light pink you could hardly tell you had anything on. But I added a colored lip balm and then added this on top of it for shine and to lock in that hydration to keep my lips healthy and beautiful.\nI would definitely buy this just because there's so many colors to pick from and how well it hydrated and nourished my lips making them feel amazing. I would not buy it for the plumping effect since I didn't see any difference after applying it.",

        "comments": "I received this product for free in exchange for a review. I'm always skeptical when it comes to \"lip plumping\" products. I have relatively full lips already; however, my mom has virtually no lips, so we both decided to try this product. Beyond the typical cooling/tingling sensation, neither of us noticed much in the way of \"plumping\". This gloss is also a lot tackier/stickier than other glosses I've tried, meaning it takes 2 or 3 applications minimum just to coat my lips. Forget rubbing your lips together to spread the product because it's nearly impossible. I received the color \"Pink\" which applied more as a clear shimmer. It doesn't last long, but I didn't really expect it to given it's a gloss. I didn't notice much change in the hydration of my lips. I live in an especially cold area & still have to apply a lip mask at night when my lips burn the most. I'll continue to use the product & update my review if needed, but upon first tries, this product is just OK.",
