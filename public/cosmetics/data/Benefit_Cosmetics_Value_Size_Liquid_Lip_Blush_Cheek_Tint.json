        "comments": "I purchased PInk Lemonade and at first it literally glides on, wet, stainy and perfect.  But in the drydown it begins to bleed and then dry.  It wasn't moisturizing, it bled and the color was splotchy.  After it dries it leaves a lip-liner effect around the lips and not much color in the middle.  IDK, maybe because I'm older that it bleeds but it just wasn't a great quality and there are other stains which are better. Maybe this was trying to be half lipstick and half tint.",

When I want to run errands but don't want to get too glammed up I usually put some benetint on my lips and cheeks along with some brown tint and am ready to go! The product doesn't feel too oily as some of the other dupes I have tried but I also love how buildable this product is! I tend to do 1-2 swipes because It is very pigmented. Another reason I love this lip product is because its an instant tint whereas other products have you leave it on for a couple of minutes which can be a deal breaker when you're going up against time, the bottle size is perfect as it fits in my purse and I honestly never go out without my benetint because you never know when you may need to touch up. I have repurchased the rose and raspberry tints because they're the most perfect cute colors!",

It provides the perfect amount of pigment and is definitely buildable.  The new colors (dark cherry and raspberry) are incredible as well!  If you're a big fan of the original Benetint formula, I recommend checking them out.  The other colors are a different formula than the original, so they do look different on the skin and I don't love them as much.  10/10 product!",
