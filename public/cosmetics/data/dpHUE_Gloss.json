I have naturally dirty blonde hair with light blonde highlights…. The golden blonde shade gave my hair life when it was dull…..it was unbelievably soft after using and looked like I just got fresh color.  I made sure to wash and conditioner my hair first, as for a smell… I didn't notice anything and didn't need to use too much to cover my long hair.  I would definitely recommend!!!",

I have used it 3 times in 1.5 months: the bottle is much smaller than I thought it would be and you have to use a lot of product to ensure proper coverage. It also did not moisturize my hair, I actually think it may have stripped moisture and shine from my hair pre-use. There was no tint to this gloss. None. The product itself is tinted but it left absolutley nothing in my hair. I love this product in theory, but in practice, it's just more overpriced goo that doesn't do what it claims to do.",

The ends now look darker than my roots and almost like a cheetah spots and it's very inconsistent. The front pieces framing my face turned the darkest which is what is so noticeable. I spent more on the bottle than I would have spent in the salon and now I won't use the rest of the bottle. Afraid to show my stylist at the salon so I am hoping it fades in the next few weeks.",

It seems like an alright product and it may have some potential but it feels like it didn't do much of a difference in the change of color. I could have done this wrong but I don't know for sure. This was my first time dying my hair on my own so in the product's defense, I'm a complete rookie in hair coloring. Maybe I'll leave it in longer than 20 minutes the next time I use it. I don't plan on giving up on this though. It's a learning experience and I gave it a shot, to say the least. The positive is that it made my hair super soft so I can't complain about that. It also covered up some of the white hairs I have growing too so I'm sure it did something. I just can't tell with the natural dark brown hair is all. The smell is a little strange too but it doesn't bother me all that much.",

I used this when my hair had a lot of gray roots and I should have been using a box color like I usually do so this was a pretty tough test of the product. I washed my hair first and then applied the \"stain\". I used a lot it seemed and concentrated on my most gray areas. I left it in 2 hours because I wanted maximum color. My hands were stained with the warm brown color and did not come clean with soap and water. I used sink cleaner with bleach and it took the stain right off. I rinsed the product out after 2 hours (cleaned my house while it was processing), applied my normal stying products and blow dried my hair. My hair is very thick and coarse and does not usually hold color well. My hair came out feeling very silky and soft. I could tell a difference in color too. My hair seemed more of a rich tone. I would say this product is like a deep conditioner with a color stain. It did not totally cover my gray but blended it pretty well. Not sure how long it will last as I just used this product.",
