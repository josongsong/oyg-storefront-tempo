The second he put it on his eyes, they looked instantly younger! Like holy cow! We had a fun Thanksgiving of drinking and food and both of our skin showed it. This took the puffiness down, considerably. Smoothed out fine lines, and brightened his under eye area. I've used a lot of under eye creams and this just blew me away with how quickly effective it is. We are both super happy with this, and will buy the full size :)",

It was a bit of a stretch for to try this because I'm only in my 20s but I purchased this despite most users being 20-30 years my senior. I was hoping it would be moisturizing enough to help plump up my under eye area and make my dark circles less noticeable but I guess I'm just not the right candidate for this product. If it's still around in the future I would give it a second go though.",

I have had bags under both eyes for quite some time and nothing helped.One eye was worse than the other. I have used many expensive products, and nothing helped.I have used this wonderful product for 10 days and one eye is completely changed with no bags and the other is almost gone. I will definately keep using this product!! It has taken years off my age.",
