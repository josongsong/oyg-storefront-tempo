It's been a perfect color match for me as a medium-neutral undertone and it LASTS. very buildable coverage and it covers my freckles and evens out my complexion very well. I use less foundation because this product helps smooth out so much for me already. \n\nMy biggest tip is to warm/spread product on the back of your hand first before applying to your face so that it isn't too tacky or thick.

I have used this for 2-3 years now and I do not use anything else. It stands alone or blends well with moisturizer or classic with foundation. A little goes a long way and this size is perfect. I normally dont care to buy expensive makeup but this is my holy grail and the only thing i feel cannot be dupe by a drugstore or otherwise. Just get it! I get medium 23.5.

I don't have to use a primer all the time, but during winter in Michigan I do.  I play hockey and yes, you don't have to get ready and wear make up for sports but I'm approaching 60 and still like to cover the dark circles!

However, and this is a BIG however, I am very disappointed with the amount of product in the tube. Don't be fooled by the size of the tube because half of it is air! After opening my first tube, squeezing out all of the air, only half the tube had actual product in it. I thought \"this must be a mistake\" so I took it back to the store, received an exchange and the exact thing happened with my second tube. Both where brand new, in boxes and completely sealed. For the price I totally expected a full tube of product. The packaging is very deceiving!",
