I used this face wash yesterday with my typical tinted spf and powder combo and was an oil slick 3 hours after, when usually I don't have breakthrough oil for at last 5-6 hours. I tried this face wash last night with my usual nightitme moisturizer, and woke up and oil slick again, which is not normal for me. Will be returning.",

Purchased here because it was sold out at Senti Senti (Korean skin care store based in NY) and I'm confused why it costs more on Ulta LOL you should match your prices to the cost it is everywhere, or everyone should support small owned businesses. They ship quick too!",
