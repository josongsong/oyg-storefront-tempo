Micellar Water requires waaay too much rubbing and I always lost a bunch of eyelashes! It was getting to the point where I didn't even want to wear mascara anymore because I didn't want to lose all of my lashes. \n\nI finally decided to give this product a try (because obviously it's on the pricier side, I was hesitant) and WOW! I put a dab on my finger tip and rub gently along my lashes for a couple of seconds, then use a slightly damp cotton pad to gently wipe it all off and ta-da! No more makeup left behind! And no lashes lost! \n\nSeriously, you need to try this. Please keep selling this product forever!! It's expensive, but the bottle is big and will last a while, especially since I use such a tiny amount on my eyes.",

Mascara you have to work at a little more but all of my eyelashes are intact (Micellar water I definitely lose a lash or 2 everytime) I have rosacea so frangrence bothers my skin normally.. if I follow with cleanser immediately after I'm fine I don't get irritated! If i do something else in between I do get pretty red. I just don't get why companies use fragrance still. I'll keep using this but once I run out I will probably find something else",

I tried this for nearly a week, and every time the same issues. So frustrating. In addition, this lotion has an added fragrance that smells like grandma's cheap perfume.",

So its putting a lotion that removes your make up. It doesnt leave a nasty oily face. I cant use oil removers because it just grosses me out. This one is amazing though. It cleans but does make my skin feel hydrated but not overly so. It has a light, pleasant smell and i need 3 max pumps to clean my entire face. This is definitely my go to make up remover.",

It does not irritate my sensitive skin around my eyes. It does take off caked on makeup (with an extra pump 😜). It takes off lash glue, waterproof mascara and eyeliners. It is so smooth you gently massage in like lotion to let it break down the makeup then wipe away your sins 😆. I have been recommending this product for years! I will continue to do so because there is nothing out there that works better AND treats my skin nicer. I hope you think so too.",

Because I don't have to use a cotton ball and don't have to rub hard, my eyelashes stay much healthier and fuller.  And on the rest of my face, it rinses clean, and I don't have to use a cleanser after I use this product.  Just rub gently onto face with fingertips, rinse off, and go to bed.  It is a minor thing, but the pump dispenser also makes this product easier to use than a product with a screw top.  No fumbling to recap a bottle or jar with greasy fingers, like I have to do with other makeup removers.  And it totally removes the makeup without drying or irritating my sensitive skin.",

The texture is creamy but in an oily kind of way which requires me to use more than I would if I was using a cleansing oil instead, and the fragrance isn't great but not horrible either if the product performed. When I use it, I find myself having to triple clean my face after using this product - when I use this, I then wash my face and then use micellar water to remove the left over makeup because this does a poor job at removing it. I do use Bite Beauty Mascara and NARS foundation, perhaps that's why it won't perform on me. Unfortunately I didn't return it, so now I have it as a last resort because is too many steps to clean my face using this product.",
