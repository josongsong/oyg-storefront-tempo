Wash your face first please before any exfoliating product! I have sensitive combination skin and I didn't feel dried out or inflamed at all after using this product so I definitely will continue to use this every week!(cleared blackheads for me) I used this as a mask for 5 minutes and then scrubbed it into my skin before rinsing off and finished with a wet washcloth to ensure everything got off and then also followed with the moisture surge toner, moisturizer, and Laroche Posey's Cicaplast to make sure my redness wouldn't flare up from the salicylic acid. Overall really like this product so far!!",

        "comments": "My skin type has historically been on the dry side, but as I have become older, it has gotten more combo, with oiliness in my t-zone, and enlarged pores and blackheads around my nose. I have extremely sensitive skin, so at my dermatologist's recommendation, I have been testing this product out as a mask just on the oily parts of my skin (t-zone) rather than an all over daily cleanser.\n\nThe texture had a fine grit, and I applied a thin layer to my t-zone, which hardened over the five minutes it sat before I washed it off. After removal, the corners of my nose felt slightly irritated (like a very mild stinging), which was resolved after applying my normal moisturizer, but they stayed red for a few hours despite the moisturizer. I had applied the mask before bed and the redness was gone by the next day. The instructions say you can apply it as a mask 1-2 times a week, but due to the redness, I found that I liked it best once a week.\n\nAs for the results- I was very impressed! Immediately I noticed that my blackheads were gone and my pores looked significantly smaller. I also noticed far less oiliness on my t-zone and my skin felt overall healthier and more balanced. These results seemed to last for nearly the entire week after using the mask as well. The first time I used the mask I had one minor breakout come to the surface, but I did not have that happen any subsequent times I used the mask. I also found that in the days after using the mask that my foundation went on smoother in the morning because it wasn't sinking into my pores as much. I ended up really liking using the mask on Sunday nights since it felt like a nice way to pamper myself before my work week. Plus, I enjoyed having the smoother skin on Mondays, since it meant I could sleep in a little bit later since I was spending less time on my makeup in the morning. Overall, I really enjoyed this mask and I would definitely recommend it!\n\nI received this product for free in exchange for my 100% honest review.",

        "comments": "This is a good cleanser but there are a couple caveats I've found that make it not right for me. I could see this being an amazing cleanser for the right person. This cleanser left my face feeling extremely soft and not overly dry. Normally, I use the PTR anti-aging, but with 2% BHA, it's too harsh to use twice a day so I use Tatcha at night. This Clinique cleanser is not drying, with only 1% BHA, so I was able to use it twice a day. Since I was already using a BHA product, I did not see a change in my pores but I could tell this was maintaining my pores well. This would have been a great way to replace my two cleansers with one if it worked for my routine. However, I did not like the addition of physical exfoliants in this product. This tiny granuals feel like sand and the combination of physical with chemical exfoliants can create a reaction for sensitive skin types. This combination is probably great for stubborn skin that need the physical exfoliants to allow the chemical exfoliants to penetrate the skins barrier (aka your skin never absorbs product). Additionally, this product did not react well with my moisturizer, PTR hyaluronic cloud cream. While my face felt extremely soft after cleansing, it made my face feel very tacky once I added moisturizer. My moisturizer has not reacted this way to any of the cleansers I use (Fresh soy, Fresh exfoliator, Tatch, PTR anti-aging, and Philosophy Purity). I don't know what ingredient it reacts to, but I would definitely try a sample before committing to make sure it plays well with your other products. Overall, you'll love this product if you don't have sensitive skin and if it reacts well to the rest of your routine. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.",
