If you are sensitive to scents, DO NOT buy this product. \n\nPersonally, I will be buying this product again since it did not make my hair greasy at all.

It can be used on damp or dry hair which is great since I have thick hair that takes foreve to dry and I style it often. Immediately noticed a ton more shine and a lot less tangling. I got some many compliments on my hair. I loved that it did not weigh down my already heavy thick hair. Left it bouncy and shiny and helped skip a couple more months between trims. Downsides were the product can linger in the air so use in a ventilated area, leaves hands sticky even after washing and its a bit pricey, but I would still buy it. Completely worth my pennies especially since I have color treated hair and it helped go longer in between washes.",

If I blow dry my hair and style immediately (rarely happens) I don't have to worry too much about frizz but my hair holds a curl for days and the frizz just gets crazier as the days pass. Because of this, even when my hair has a nice curl, it never looks as good as the first day. I used this on days 2-4 after curling my hair and I am blown away!!! First, it got rid of the frizz in a way that no product ever has because it wasn't greasy or drying at all!!! It added a little bit of shine, but not so much that it looked wet. It also didn't leave any build up on my hair!! I didn't even realize I was on day 4 until I did the math because my hair still looked good and was nice and touchable! I usually wash my hair after day 3 because the frizz gets out of control! I'm so happy with this product, I will definitely be purchasing this from now on! The only downside is that the scent is so strong that I have to leave the room immediately after spraying it, but it does make my hair smell great all day long!",

Still had to put smoothing serum in to get it to look better. Second time I washed and conditioned with Salon quality shampoo and conditioner, air dried a bit and used way more smoothing spray. Still had to use the hot tools and smoothing spray to get it to look close to smooth and shiny. My hair feels like I have a ton of product in it, but the final result looks okay.Just too drying for my hair.",
