I got it in cherry pick and wicked apple. it is absolutely sooo beautiful and has a great tint. Even after blotting and dabbing, the color stays.

        "comments": "I can't speak to any other colors, but the shade pamplemousse is a beautiful rosy pink that is close to my natural lip color. I love that it's so glossy/juicy yet super pigmented, especially for a balm. That said, it doesn't leave behind any kind of stain and is not particularly long lasting. That isn't a claim of the product, so I'm not mad about it, but I can't help but wonder how gracefully some of the more intense colors would wear off after eating or drinking. There is a strong fruity fragrance which I enjoy but others might not. The texture is…a little sticky, but not bad considering that it's both glossy AND full-coverage. I haven't tried other products of this type but from what I've seen that's to be expected. I'm not particularly adventurous with colors and a lot of them look quite warm-toned (I have a very cool complexion), but I would totally try kiwi fizz if it ever came back in stock! Peach punisher and the cranberries have my eye too!",

        "comments": "I was so excited to try these and got 4 shades - Kiwi Fuzz, Pamplemousse, Cherry Good, and Wicked Ape. I only got to swatch and sample two colors and have two to my friend. Despite my failed experience with the product, I will try to give a fair review.   Pros: 1. All the colors are pretty. My friend showed me her swatches and they were gorgeous too.  2. Lightweight and nice feel on the lips (before I got the allergic reaction). 3. Very moisturizing. 4. Good pigmentation.   Cons: 1. Super strong scent which might have caused the allergic reaction on my skin and lips. The swatch I did on my arm caused rashes (Kiwi Fuzz)  and my lips started stinging and swelled up (Wicked Apple). Unfortunately, the reaction was not immediate so I had already put it on my lips and then swatched on my arm for a few minutes before any reaction happened. My friend had no negative reactions, so everyone will react differently. 2. The click pen does not work as expected and you need way more than the recommended clicks to dispense the product. You need to keep an eye on how much product comes out so you won't get too much. 3. Dark colors were streaky and patchy despite putting them on moisturized and smooth lips. I swatched Wicked apple and it was difficult to get an even and smooth application. My friend said the same thing with her Cherry Good lipstick. She did not have the same issue with Pamplemousse.  4. Expensive for what it is. 5. No real staying power (obviously, since this is more like a lip balm than lipstick) and tends to bleed.   Overall, I am disappointed with the product as it did not live up to the hype.  I only returned the colors I had tested that caused an allergic reaction because I did not want the company to completely lose out since no one could have predicted that I would have an allergic reaction. I gave the unopened lipsticks to my friend and she said she likes the product but would not purchase it on her own.",
