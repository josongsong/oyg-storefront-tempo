I was using CeraVe's regular lotion. While it's hydrating, it's way too thick for daytime, and I'd end up super greasy. \n\nBut with THIS, it's been a total game-changer for ME. The improvement in sebum control is unreal. The morning after using it, my skin feels hydrated with barely any sebum—like, my skin is looking NORMAL 😇. (I have been using this for about 2 months now and i'm obssesed).\n\nHere's the trick with the Oil Control Moisturizer: work on one section of your face at a time since it dries quickly.

I was using CeraVe's regular lotion. While it's hydrating, it's way too thick for daytime, and I'd end up super greasy. \n\nBut with THIS, it's been a total game-changer for ME. The improvement in sebum control is unreal. The morning after using it, my skin feels hydrated with barely any sebum—like, my skin is looking NORMAL 😇. (I have been using this for about 2 months now and i'm obssesed).\n\nHere's the trick with the Oil Control Moisturizer: work on one section of your face at a time since it dries quickly. I start with my forehead and then work my way down. Total lifesaver!",

        "comments": "I loved this product because it significantly decreased how oily my T-Zone would get throughout the day, therefore making my makeup way less patchy and from sliding off during an 8 hour shift. However, it has broken me out ALL over my face but specifically on my nose and chin!! It has been over a week of having the same areas get reoccuring white-heads!\n\nIf you do not have acne-prone skin, this would be great.. but as thats something I struggle with and am sensitive to, this product is a nightmare.",
