Even the lightest shade pulls super orange on my fair skin, and even when I apply foundation or concealer on top, it just doesn't quite look right. I also feel like it accentuated any texture or lines on my skin. Lastly, it broke me out and I am throwing it away. I wanted to try giving this a few more tries to see if I can get it to work for me in any way, but every time I wear it I have a ton of whiteheads.",

But now i have a shade that melts into my skin perfectly, giving that glow everyone raves over!\n\nOverall, thank you for expanding the shade range. We needed it!",

I am OCD about checking ingredients and checked the ingredients multiple time before placing an order as I had time because they were sold out of their first round. I placed my order for 2 shades just incase. It was taking long to ship and I kept checking the app on my order status, something told me to check the reviews again as more people were using it. I noticed people complaining that they broke out and others saying it had Bismuth (a pore clogger). I rechecked the ingredients and sure enough it had bismuth in it as the last ingredient! Now I know I wasn't going crazy because I checked it multiple times, I tried to cancel my order and sent an email. Minutes after my email I get a email confirming that my order has shipped, but sadly I knew I was not going to be able to use this product now. I called ELF the next day and they told me that it was a new product and there was no way the ingredients had changed and they couldn't cancel my order because it shipped, I told her I checked this multiple times but I never took a screenshot and had no proof. I happened to stroll on TikTok and saw someone posting the ingredients as they were comparing it to CT and sure enough I was not crazy! ELF why change the ingredients so fast? They did refund my money for both so thank you for that! Hoping they will remove the bismuth and be more cautious about pore clogging ingredients for us acne prone people.",
