I don't get a gel-like hold at all from this product.  In fact, some of my curls start to frizz just an hour or two after applying.  The curl cream in this brand works MUCH better and gives me a cast similar to a gel product.",

I have lots of hair, but it is very fine and very heavy, so heavy the curls normally fall into waves after a few hours. I have a chin length, layered bob style. This product keeps my hair in loose curls despite the weight.\n\nI use a softball size application of AG Care Mousse Extra-Firm along with my other products and diffuse with heat for 15 minutes. I air dry the remainder of the time needed to have the curls stay until I wash next. I do not want to be without this product so much so that I have 2 cans in reserve. Very happy with this product. One of the few products that live up to the claims of retaining curls.",

I really like the hold it leaves. No extreme crunch it does leave a cast that is easy to scrunch out to leave my curls feeling soft and bouncy. Love that it is lightweight specifically for my fine 2C/3A curly hair and it left a beautiful shine to my dark brown hair. I'm so glad i found a mousse that doesnt have my curls feeling like im back in 2001 with string stiff curls. \n\nHighly recommend this mousse",

I have lots of hair, but it is very fine and very heavy, so heavy the curls normally fall into waves after a few hours. I have a chin length, layered bob style. This product keeps my hair in loose curls despite the weight.\n\nI use a softball size application of AG Care Mousse Extra-Firm along with my other products and diffuse with heat for 15 minutes. I air dry the remainder of the time needed to have the curls stay until I wash next. I do not want to be without this product so much so that I have 2 cans in reserve. Very happy with this product. One of the few products that live up to the claims of retaining curls.",

I tried shaking it hard, holding it upside down, everything i could think ok but couldn't continue using it.  Im not sure if I got a defective bottle or if all of them are like that. I was in the muddle of doing my hair when this happened and had to use the honey Doux mousse to finish the last section. Unintentionally I discovered a great mix which made my hair last a whole week defined.  In turn, I am debating buying another one because the definition is great but they are pricey to leave a good amount of product go to waste.",
