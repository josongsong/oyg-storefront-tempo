This doesnt seem to affect its ability as a lip stain, its just very questionable and i dont know what im putting on my lips. I dont know if it's the shade color, rose rising, that has this problem, but its concerning. I dont want to be putting on moldy lip stain if this is mold. Ive tried shaking it snd pumping the wand, but the color spread and it seems like there is more.",

It just glides on so smoothly and actually feels hydrating. In fact I also ordered the milani plumping lip balm (in color jam) to go along with this lip stain and it's not even needed. The stain itself is already shiny, although it can be blotted out if you prefer, and is pretty opaque. I have tried other stains that are too transparent and need many coats or another product on top, but not this one I would definitely recommend it! I will be trying out other colors.",

While the color is beautiful and it indeed is moisturizing. It falls very short as a lip \"stain\". I was very excited to try it as soon as I could and it looks great is moisturizing but as I don't really like the \" lipstick\" feel this won't work for me because I was looking for a stain because I like how a stain feels like nothing and you can definitely feel this on your lips.",
