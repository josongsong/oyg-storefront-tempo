My skin is sensitive, prone to eczema and redness and this kept that at bay! My issue is that the tube and amount is so tiny! I have to buy every two months. I'm looking at other gel moisturizing cleansers but would use this again if they updated the packaging.",

        "comments": "I use this product in the shower to wash my face. I've found it doesn't remove makeup very well, especially mascara. You might want to use a makeup remover first, then cleanse with this gel. Because it doesn't lather, it just takes a little getting used-to -- getting the \"serving size\" right, and massaging it into the skin for long enough to effectively lift oils. But, it works really well. It does not leave a residue behind after I've rinsed it off. I love how light it is, and the fragrance is pleasant while using -- no lingering fragrance. While it is pretty expensive for the amount you receive, it's the best cleanser I've used in a while, so for me it is worth the splurge!",

I have been using it for the past week, and I love how it makes my face feel. I am able to cleanse my face and take off my daily makeup all in one step. I like that it also doesn't dry out my skin or leave my face to oily after using. A lot of cleansers that take off makeup tend to leave an oily residue which I absolutely hate but this one didn't do that! Because of the hydra-gel consistency it left my face feeling hydrated and clean after use! I used it in combination with the rest of my skin care routine and on its own and both ways my skin was left feeling hydrated and clean. I did not get a dry/tight feeling that some cleansers leave! I will definitely be incorporating this product into my everyday skin care routine going forward.\n\n#productreview #productreviewer #pr #gifted #freeproduct #producttester #recievedforfree #skincare #skinhealth",

I'm not someone who usually wears makeup, so I was pretty concerned about how I'd get all the STUFF off of my face! I have really sensitive skin, which usually breaks out after wearing too much makeup, so I'd resigned myself to having an itchy red face post-wedding (as long as the wedding pictures looked good though, right?).\n\nAt the end of day one of wedding festivities, I was desperate to have my makeup-free face back… enter NudeStix to the rescue!\n\nI only needed a small (pea sized) amount to see results! The makeup came off without issue, while leaving a lovely scent behind - not too strong, but definitely refreshing. I did a second wash (mostly because of my own paranoia of sleeping with makeup on), and my face felt clean, without feeling dehydrated. \n\nNeedless to say, I used this cleanser all weekend. The best surprise - I had no post-makeup breakouts (I don't know if it was the NudeStix, but I'm willing to believe it helped).\n\nNotes: \nThough the packaging says safe for eyes, I used a different product to remove my eye makeup (my paranoia again). \n\nI wish there was an exfoliating component in this product, but I've just been using this in tandem with my natural exfoliator.\n\nAll in all, definitely something I would recommend, and absolutely a product I'd make sure to have with me for makeup removal purposes :)",

You can definitely have a gentle cleanser that actually *cleans the skin* but this one does not... therefore I would not recommend :/ It just kind of feels like the same consistency of hand sanitizer if that makes sense, just a gel that you move around on your skin lol",
