It's works great as an only cleanser or your 2nd cleanse after removing make with and oil based cleanser as it really does remove everything well. You get a decent amount of product in the bottle and there are not many ingredients to irritate the skin.",

While it removes a lot of makeup, it had trouble removing my water resistant daily mineral sunscreen. I have to double cleanse to remove the sunscreen. \n\nI plan to repurchase this fantastic cleanser.",

I was using Cerave and it never felt it got everything off. This does and becomes frothy while cleansing the entire face, no makeup left and doesnt dry my face out. I noticed a difference immediately because my face was actually getting clean for me to then use toners, serums, etc. Buy it.",
