I use 1-2 drops on my whole face. Its lightweight and absorbs beautifully into the skin without clogging pores. The smaller size also helps preserve the oil's freshness and prevents waste, which is a smart move considering how oils can oxidize over time. Don't let the size fool you! This little bottle packs a powerful punch of hydration and skin barrier support.",

I do wish they make a bigger bottle, just bc I LOVE it so much. I use day and night. My under eyes just Thank you! I used a  banana brighten cream under my eyes which ended up drying them out so bad, I thought they were damaged forever. Thanks to this oil, my under eyes are back and better. I use the Bakuchiol oil for dry skin with this and MAGIC!!",

The oil is the same as any squaline, squaline is my go-to face oil since the Ordinary discontinued their \"B\" oil. It's light enough but also hydrating.",

Back to the main reason I use it, my face, I put it on at the very end of my nightly regimen all Good Molecules and it makes my face feel like velvet.
