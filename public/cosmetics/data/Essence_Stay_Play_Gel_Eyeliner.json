The only problem is that the pencil itself is made of this weird plasticy material that is VERY hard to sharpen. I love a sharpenable pencil, much more than a retractible one for sanitary reasons. But I will problably not repurchase this because of what a hard time I have sharpening it.",

Value and budget friendly, this competes with some of the prestige brands. It's often difficult to find a nude eyeliner that will work in your waterline without breaking the bank but this never disappoints. Only cons, sometimes the pencil dries out and your tip will break off and you have to sharpen the pencil. The pros outweigh the cons, i wish Essence would make more colors in this gel eyeliner formula !",

It was better than my high end. it worked so well in the waterline BUT THEN I started noticing my eyes burned constantly and I always had stuff in my contacts, little black dots. hard black dots. and they gathered on my contact and in the corners of my eyes, constantly felt like dirt in my eyes. it also felt tight on my waterline after a couple hours. I thought at first it was the new mascaras I was trying and so I kept rinsing my contacts and I ruined soooooooo many incredible eyeshadow looks by the tearing and messing with them so much. I started eliminating products and I realized it's this. I discovered at first it's incredible but then a few hours in it begins getting soooo dry and crunchy that it crumbles into your eyes in little bits. its irritating. soooo amazing at first it truly bums me out. I bought the brown one too and I'm going to try to use these up as regular upper liner but no no no do not put in your water or tight line! especially not with contacts ugh",
