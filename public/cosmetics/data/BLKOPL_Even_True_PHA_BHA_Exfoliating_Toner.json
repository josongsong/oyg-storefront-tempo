        "comments": "I have combination acne prone skin. I've been using Glow Recipe's PHA + BHA toner for a few years & loved it. I bought this toner as a possible more affordable alternative to the Glow Recipe toner. I've been using this toner consistently for about a month & I'm not a fan. It goes on tacky & leaves my skin dry even after applying moisturizer afterward. Plus, I noticed that there's a lot of pilling when I use it. I don't know if it's user error or if this doesn't play well with my other products. I'll switch back to Glow Recipe or find another similar toner.",

        "comments": "I disagree with the other review saying it's a Paula's dupe.....it's better. It's just as effective but also fades dark spots and doesn't have the oily texture Paula's has. \n\nOther exfoliants do better for dark spots but the PHA works well enough that I think of it as a bonus since I primarily use BHAs for acne control.",
