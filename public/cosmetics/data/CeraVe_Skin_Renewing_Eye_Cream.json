I was hesitant because it has petrolatum in it, but I was very pleasantly surprised. My eyes have slowly improved and the consistency has a really nice weight to it that doesn't slide around due to the petrolatum. My skin feels nice. I wish it was a little bit more hydrating but it's still very good.",

The formula contains ceramides that are essential for our skin so that strengthens as it repairs. This product layers well with other skin care products. I've been using it for three weeks now and have noticed diminished crow's feet and less puffiness, as well as evening out trhe skin tone (my dark circles) around my eyes. My skin feels bouncier and less sensitive. Highly recommend, this formula checks all the boxes for me personally as an eye cream and is an amazing value.",
