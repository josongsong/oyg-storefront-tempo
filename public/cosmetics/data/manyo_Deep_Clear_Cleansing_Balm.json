The only thing is dont like is when i used it to take off waterproof mascara and eyeliner it burned bad, so i will just use to take off makeup on my face instead. Overall love this product.",

It in fact does have 'fragranve' listed as an ingredient, so im not surr why it was listed as a fragrsnce free product. It also isnt as moisturizing and emulsifying as other balms I've tried. Unfortunately I'll have to return it.",

I have rosacea and this doesn't irritate my skin AT all. It takes all of my foundation off and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I enjoy the texture and find it doesn't have any strong scent (a huge pro for me). Will definitely keep using!",

I had been using the big name (blue) brand makeup balm and decided to give this one a try. The size of the jar is larger and you get a good amount of product. I like that it comes with a spoon to remove the balm out. It does a greatvjob of removing all makeup even waterproof. It is scent free and vegan. It is more expensive than the drugstore brand and i did get mine free in exchange for a review on another site but its a great makeup remover and I would buy it again.",
