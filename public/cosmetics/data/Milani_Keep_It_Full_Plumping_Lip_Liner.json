        "comments": "The stinging is a little bit too much for me even if it's just like literally 30 seconds... I think because the liner concentrated on a small area, like the corner of my lip, It's more intense sensation... whereas the plumping gloss I've been using hurts less coz it spreads out all over my lips. The stinging of this liner makes my lips corner a bit red and smudgy... you can see it a bit in one of my pics where it says Liner+Lipstick. But in another photo this problem is fixed by just going over it a few times  with the liner and it covers up the redness and it defines the lips and gives a clean edge.\n      I tested the Milani Plumping Lip Liner-150 HotShot and had mixed results. While it claimed to have a plumping effect, I didn't notice much of a difference in person. Photos showed a slight effect, but it was barely noticeable. I picked the wrong shade but it works great under my lipstick. The good thing is it glides on so smoothly and lasts long and it's very matte... like super matte.\n       The color 150 HotShot is a darker color in person like more brownish but in photos it appears to be like an orangey brown. You can smell and taste a little bit of buttery cocoa but only for a few seconds and it fades away.\n      That rubbery end of the lip liner threw me off at first, it gives it a pen-like appearance like I can just click or twist it to extend... coz this lip liner is not the traditional pencil design. I was like \"how do I even get more product out?\" lol but then I realized it was sharpenable.",
