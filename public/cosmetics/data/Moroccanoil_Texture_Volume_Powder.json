When I use this texture powder in my hair, it does add texture and volume after I blend it in. However, it leaves a slight sticky to the touch. Interestingly, if I use it with little amount at the root, blend it in and go to bed, I would wake up with nice volumed hair without the sticky touch. So that's how I have been using this powder for the past week.",

Unfortunately, when I apply the powder onto my hair to achieve this it becomes very sticky in texture and would stick to my fingers and make it hard to rub into my hair which I must do since I have black hair.
