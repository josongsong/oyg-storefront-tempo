Both times in my life, then and now, I've been under immense stress and my skin shows it. This has been a holy grail product for me. I was so frustrated that it had 4.1 stars here I had to leave a review lol. I have oily / combo skin that is acne prone. For reference of my skin type, some other products that work on me are La Roche Possay gel cleanser, products with sulfur, CeraVe moisturizers, etc. This product has a natural ingredient that supposedly \"breaks up the communication between acne that causes more acne\" or whatever it says on the box, and I think that's why it is especially curing for me. It also smells so good, like medical but expensive lol. Just try it.",

No matter how much money I spent, moisturizers and sunscreens left me greasy, my skin feeling smothered and broken out. This is the first moisturizer I've ever been able to use. Its so light and refreshing, I absolutely love it. I have not had a single breakout from this. My skin drinks it in. My other products work well with this and my make up goes over smoothly. Highly recommend.",

A family member of mine is an esthetician, so even after years of trying different high cost brand moisturizers, none work like this one. When I do try to switch, I break out due to my sensitive skin. I have super sensitive skin due to allergies, and I've struggled with acne for years.\nIt will most likely be the only moisturizer I will use for the rest of my life. I'm bummed they don't sell it in stores anymore, so now I have to order online. Nevertheless, after many trials and errors of different products, I will forever be the poster child for this stuff.",
