My skin is oily-combination and thick, so I'm not sure if it will be right for me for summertime. But for cooler days it works just great! For those with thinner, drier skin this cream is probably a must-have: you will benefit from the dewy, glowy look and visually conceal any undesired texture. It is also very nutritious, so I think it should be also fixing the wrinkle concerns from within. It has a pleasant, classic creamy texture, and subtle smell.",

I even got a Lancome cleanser and use w/Genifique serum and Renergie eye. The only positive is I love the Renergie eye and Renergie foundation because they work well together for overall appearance but still no firming or lifting. What's with all the perfume in these products? It gets to be too much! I don't mind paying for products that work but am very disappointed. Will continue to use for another 2 - 3 weeks to say I gave it a fair chance.",
