From a product standpoint, the price point is reasonable on this and it lasts forever. It's a very thick and creamy product with an amazing light, spa-like scent, and you get an amazing lather with it (I pair it with my Foreo Luna and a dime-size dollop creates endless suds). This gives you a refreshingly deep clean, but is gentle enough to use every day. I usually apply dearcloud's New/Youth Collagen Cream after washing my face, and the results are amazing. The duo has taken years off of my skin and my once dry skin has a plump bouncy feeling that I notice both in the mirror and when I'm applying my makeup. I've tried a lot of skincare and have even fallen into some trends (hello, Drunk Elephant) dearcloud has given me the best results at a fraction of the price. Try this one, you won't be disappointed!",

I had to go back in with my regular Cetaphil daily cleanser to get the rest of my powder off. I didn't even have a lot on. I have the bare minimum of make up on. barley a layer.
