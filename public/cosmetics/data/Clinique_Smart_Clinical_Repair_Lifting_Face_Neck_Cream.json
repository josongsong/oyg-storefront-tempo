I had cystic acne when i was younger and now I'm dry most of the time. I was using Perricone MD but had used Clinique years ago. I was looking for something with a wow factor that was less pricey. I definitely found it in this cream! It's super creamy, doesn't take much product, absorbs like a dream. And fragrance free!",

        "comments": "I was concerned about the switch to a new line of creams as I've been using the old smart night cream for years as a night cream, but overall have been satisified with the change. I'm 29 and was recommended by an Ulta employee in the store the lifting face + neck cream. The cream is a completely new product. It is thicker, much firmer texture than the old one. It is also bright white. It does not have a noticeable fragrance. (The jar says fragrance free). I use it as a night cream and can definitely see and feel the difference in 'firmness' and 'lifting' in my neck; although I didn't think I really needed it and that wasn't why I used the original night cream. I have noticed some white heads in my forehead/T-Zone, but I tend to get them occasionally anyway so I can't blame the cream on it. After reading about the other variations, I wish I had the SPF version so I can try wearing it twice a day with my makeup over it. I'll be giving this one to my mom and trying the SPF one next. :)",

Here's a 5-star review for From the moment I introduced Clinique's Smart Clinical Repair Lifting Face + Neck Cream into my daily regimen, the transformation was undeniable. This luxurious cream has become the cornerstone of my skincare, delivering results that are nothing short of miraculous.\n\nThe cream's potent formula visibly lifts and rejuvenates both my face and neck, leaving my skin feeling supple and firm. Lines and wrinkles that once seemed a permanent fixture on my landscape are now softened, reduced to mere whispers of their former selves.\n\nWhat truly sets this cream apart is its efficacy. It's not just a temporary fix; it's a long-term investment in my skin's health. The anti-aging peptides and herbal extracts work in harmony to repair and protect, offering a resilience I hadn't felt in years.",

        "comments": "I received the💜Smart Clinical Repair™ Lifting Face + Neck Cream💜for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review! Thanks for the product💜∩^ω^∩💜\n💜\nWhat it is:\nA powerful face & neck cream visibly lifts skin & reduces lines + wrinkles for smoother, younger-looking skin. Plumps with instant and long-lasting hydration. Dermatologist tested.\n\n🔑Ingredients & Benefits:\n💜Multi-peptides: Help boost skin's natural collagen\n💜Hyaluronic acid, Jojoba oil, & Shea butter: Helps hydrate to help visibly plump fine, dry lines\n\n⚠️WARNING⚠️\nThis product can expose you to chemicals including Titanium dioxide, known to the State of California to cause Cancer\n\nHow to use:\nUse morning & night on face + neck\n💜\nMy experience:\nMy first impressions of the product were, the cream doesn't feel nourishing for my combination skin. Despite this being a cream, it started to feel more like a balm after a while of me rubbing it onto my skin. I don't really recommend this cream to those who have really dry skin. I still haven't seen any changes in lifting or line reducing on my skin after 2+ weeks of using the cream, so it seems that I really do need to use it for at least 12 weeks.\n\nAfter I applied the product, I felt my face wasn't really moisturized but at the same time not dry. The cream didn't feel too greasy & heavy on my oily t-zone. It felt lightweight & very absorbent on my skin. The finishing of this product looks matte, feels dewy & non-sticky on my skin. A weird thing I don't get about this cream is the fact that there's a lot of really tiny glitters in it which gives the skin a slight shimmer.\n\nThe texture of this cream is creamy & really thick that you need to dig into the jar with either your nail or a scooper. The cream does have a scent that smells pretty mild & light. The scent doesn't linger on.\n💜\nPatch test first! Just because a product works great for someone else doesn't guarantee that you'll have the same effect.",
