My skin gets triggered by weather changes, heat, and sometimes food. This cream/balm keeps my skin from having crazy flare ups, and very much reduces the texture and look of my ezcema.

This skin protectant has earned a permanent spot in my routine for how well it hydrates, soothes, and restores balance to my skin.\n\nAs someone who has sensitive skin, I've struggled with redness and irritation from environmental exposure and the occasional harsh skincare treatment. Enter this balm—it feels like a comforting hug for your face. The first thing I noticed was the texture: it's rich yet surprisingly breathable. Once applied, it creates a protective layer that shields your skin without clogging pores. I love how my skin feels deeply hydrated yet not weighed down, and the 24-hour moisture it provides is no exaggeration.\n\nOne of the standout features is its ability to calm and relieve distressed skin, thanks to colloidal oatmeal. Pair that with glycerin for hydration and 1% dimethicone to protect compromised skin, and you have a formula that not only hydrates but also strengthens your skin's moisture barrier over time. After just a few days of use, I noticed my skin felt smoother, less red, and so much more resilient.\n\nFor anyone dealing with cracked, chapped, or irritated skin—especially from harsh weather or drying prescription treatments—this balm is a lifesaver. I love to layer it on at night or use it as a targeted treatment on dry areas. The relief it provides is instant, but the long-term benefits are what really make it special.\n\nIf hydration, protection, and skin recovery are your goals, this is one product you'll want to keep within arm's reach. My skin feels nourished, soothed, and ready to take on whatever the day throws at it!",

        "comments": "This cream is OK... I have extremely dry skin and am also on an acne medication, when I saw reviews online of people who also are on retinols/oids raving about this I decided to try it. I mean it's fine... but for the price point I won't be repurchasing, but I will finish my tube up. I will say it feels nice applying and does dry down well, but kind of tacky. I typically layer a thick moisturizer under this product as well.",
