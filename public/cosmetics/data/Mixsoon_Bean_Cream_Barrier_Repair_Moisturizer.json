        "comments": "Hello,I received my order and I have started using it and love it! I have noticed a difference in the few days I have started to use it but am disappointed in the cream. I opened it and have been using very little every day, not even a drop size and when I finally settled the bottled, I noticed there is not even half the bottle filled with cream. I am sending a picture of the bottle with the cream in it for reference. As you can see how much cream came on the bottle. This is very deceiving and disappointing as it looked to be a full bottle when it came. And as you can see it hasn't even been 4 days since this has been delivered. I would appreciate it if someone would address this concern as this is my only complaint of your product so far.Thank you Gauri Patel",
