It is lightweight and hydrates my oily skin effectively without being too heavy, when set with powder it holds up through a standard indoor workday and a workout after. If it does wear off in spots it still looks natural. It plays well with other products, drugstore and high end alike, while having better coverage than i expected. I would classify it as light coverage with slight buildability",

I have combination skin and most tinted moisturizers were either too dewy or just too heavy.  My skin tone is medium neutral and the #5N works the best.  A little goes a long way.  Yes, it does not cover as well as others but I solved that problem by first applying Dr. Jart+ Cicapair Derma Green Solution.  I have rosacea and this product is amazing. It neutralizes the red making it a perfect base for ColourPop's tinted moisturizer.  I have always suffered from acne and I have textured skin.  But since using this tinted moisturizer and Dr. Jart, I actually have been told I have beautiful skin.  To set it for special events I finish it off with some press powder.  It lasts all day.  I hope they never stop making this product.",

        "comments": "If this product ever stops being sold I'm just going to give up makeup entirely. Maybe an exaggeration... but maybe not. This tinted moisturizer is AMAZING. I am 33 nearing 34 and have always had very very oily skin and difficult to match undertones (light olive, slightly neutral leaning yellow). Finding face products - liquids, powders, creams, serums, anything - has always been a chore. If a product matches my undertone it doesn't keep my oiliness at bay more than a few hours; if it keeps my oil at bay a little longer then it doesn't match my undertone. And the oiliness? Oh the oiliness. I'd use pH neutral face wash, serum, gel-based hydrating moisturizer, mattifying primer, and long-lasting mattifying foundation (or similar product), finishing off with a mattifying setting spray while chugging water all day to stay hydrated and I'd STILL be blotting by hours 4-6. \n\nThen I stumbled across this product in Ulta looking for something else entirely but decided to give this a shot because A.) moisturizer; B.) shade range; C.) pretty packaging! I didn't want heavy or full-coverage foundation - I just wanted something to even out my skin tone and I'd take care of the blemishes via concealer. \n\nI found a shade that somewhat closely matched my skin tone in the always-bad lighting of those aisles, and have been wearing it almost daily for 2 weeks now. THIS PRODUCT IS INCREDIBLE. Truly, tear-inducingly incredible. I feel like my frustrations of spending years and years finding a product that ticks even 90% of my makeup needs boxes has finally been alleviated. I apply it with a damp beauty blender over a washed and well moisturized based - with or without any mattifying primers - and it keeps my skin tone even and my oiliness TRULY at bay for 10+ hours. A brush leaves a weird finish and finger application grosses me out. The oily is still there of course because, you know, our bodies work that way, but the oil-slick ice rink SHINE is nowhere to be seen and I don't feel any of it sitting on my face like I do other products. This feels and looks absolutely weightless, genuinely like a second skin. It also doesn't settle into my laugh lines at all. The color match isn't 10000% perfect because I sort of guessed in the dim aisle but honestly it's like a half-fraction of a shade off and you really cannot tell unless you're in some high powered vanity lighting (I can't even tell in natural light). This is my new go-to that I'll be stocking up on and I hope ColourPop never discontinues this. It would be heartbreaking to have to start all over again.",

        "comments": "I was so happy to have found a tinted moisturizer and concealer that matched my skin tone perfectly. I also really liked the packaging for the entire Pretty Fresh line, which is what initially drew me to it. However, after using it for about 2 months, I was breaking out so much on the sides of my face, jaw line, neck, and chin. I wasn't developing white heads, but hormonal and cystic acne. It was extremely painful and was making me lose confidence in myself. I didn't know it was this product that was breaking me out until I went on vacation for a week and didn't wear makeup. The acne was subsiding and I was regaining confidence again. But, the minute I came back and put it on my face, the acne came back almost immediately. My hormones were going crazy. I'm not sure what it is, but I do NOT recommend this product at all. \n\nMy friend purchased it the same time that I did and she started realizing it with herself too because her family was telling her that she was getting more acne that usual. Also, we are skin care enthusiasts so we have our routines set in stone from oil cleansing, foam cleanse, toner, essence, serum, moisturizer, eye creams...you name it, we are doing it. This product just destroyed my hormones for the 2 months it was used and I would never wish that on anyone else. We are both 26 F with combination skin.\n\nPSA: If something works for you, don't go looking for something new!! I am still recovering from the scars left on my neck and face.",
