It is creamy but not shiny, prevents feathering, and has nice color payoff. The brown tones are very nice. I think the espresso one could be flattering on most people, but definitely best suited for cool toned skin. If you are adamant on clean and natural products, this is probably a pass.

You could easily use this for your full lip if you want to skip lipstick. One of the shades is pretty much an exact dupe for Hugh by Mario (not sure which one, see complaint below). I'm a little concerned that they won't be very long-lasting since they're so creamy.\n\nI knocked off a star because I quickly discovered that the color names are not printed on the actual product, only on the plastic packaging!! So I have no idea which liner is which shade :( Please print the names or even a number on the liners so we can differentiate!",
