Eye creams are supposed to be used around the eye area. It's not like I would put it IN my eyes, but you cant even get close to your lashes (or use a hudrating spray). For something designed for sensitive or mature skin and healing the skin barrier, I'm afraid this just doesn't instill confidence. You aren't supposed to burn your eyes, and I'm surprised they didn't catch that in formulation. They sure charge enough for it!",

Sometimes I mix it with C-Tango but the results I'm reporting on apply to when I use Ceramighty by itself. Ceramighty has a similar texture and consistency to C-Tango. It takes about 5 minutes to fully absorb given I have already applied several facial moisturizers. I rub the excess over my entire face. I apply Ceramighty 2-3 times at a sitting. I have noticed immediate diminished appearance of depth and length of crows feet. The skin is temporarily firmer. I can't make any long term claims at this point but the short term results are promising",
