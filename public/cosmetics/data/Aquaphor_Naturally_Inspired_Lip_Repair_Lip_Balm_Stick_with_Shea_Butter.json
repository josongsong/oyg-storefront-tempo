I had been using Blistex and it wasn't healing them. Aquaphor healed them within a couple days. I did use the product several times a day. They now feel soft and healthy, no longer dry or cracking. I use it under lipstick and it creates a nice base. I'll continue to buy it and recommend it.",

It might be a couple bucks cheaper at the drugstore, but I'm happy to be able to support Ulta and earn points for buying it through them. Also, it's always good to have a little something to throw in with your order if the value of your other products isn't quite enough for free shipping. Personally, I can't use Aquaphor's Lip Repair in the little tube because it has almost all the same ingredients —but with chamomile essence added. (TIP for fellow allergy sufferers: if you have a common ragweed allergy, stay away from anything in the daisy/calendula/chamomile/echinacea family because those plants are all in the same family as ragweed!!!) \n\nAnyways, this lip balm is my go-to for simple, non-fragranced, non-irritating lip protection and nourishment. I apply it at the end of my skincare routine after washing my face or showering before bed. If I need a little extra oomph I layer CeraVe's Healing Ointment over top to extend the wear and lock in the moisture. Scented/flavored lip balms can be fun for a midday pick-me-up, but at bedtime I want to make sure that the lip balm I'm using has minimal, effective, gentle ingredients so that if it smears around my face or on my pillow while I'm sleeping it won't be a problem. This does the job! I only give it 4 stars because even if I love a product, I don't give it 5 stars unless there's something really innovative or mind blowing about it. But don't get me wrong, this is a wonderful product for what it is and for the price point it's offered at. (Also I've noticed a lot of 5 star reviews on Ulta seem to be fake like they were made by the company or bots or something? So it's also my attempt to prove this is my genuine opinion, lol.)",

I put it on and 10 minutes later my lips still feel as dry as it did before putting on the chapstick. not to mention after a while a white ring formed around my mouth and just sayin I got a lot of stares from my neighbors when I went outside. My eczema is really bad, the skin on my lips will peel up, form blisters, bruise, and bleed if they aren't hydrated. if you have severe eczema like I do, this isn't for you. would give 0 stars if I could",
