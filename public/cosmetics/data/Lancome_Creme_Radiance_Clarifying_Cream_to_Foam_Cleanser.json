        "comments": "I discovered this face wash in college, I'm 33 now and I still love it! It cleans your face so well and clears it of all makeup and dirt. It has a scent, and it ALWAYS has. For many of us scents are not a big deal, it honestly makes this product feel more luxe to me personally and does not negatively affect my skin. It also goes away right after you wash your face. For a few months about 10 years ago I stopped using it and my face was breaking out so bad. Once I got back to using this my face cleared completely after a few weeks. Also you need only a LITTLE bit. I've had tubes of this last me 6 or more months and I wash my face daily. I'm talking a pea sized amount you lather up and wash your face with. The people complaining of residue are using way too much. LOVE LOVE this face wash so much and always keep multiple backups of it. It's a steep price but trust me it's so concentrated it lasts way more than diluted liquidy face washes.",

        "comments": "Why did you change this product?! I have been using this product for 5+ years if not longer. Many women in my family also use this product. Why why why change it?! The formula is not the same and they added a scent. Why why why :( \n\nI have super sensitive skin and struggle to find skincare products that work for me. All of the reasons i loved this cleanser are now gone. The old one was so light and airy and was perfect as an end of day cleanser or a morning cleanser. It took my makeup off without stripping my skin dry. It was easy to dispense and lathered beautifully. \n\nThis new one is sticky, does not lather at all, harder to dispense when I have makeup remover and water on my face / eyes, its SCENTED (why?!), sticky (again - why sticky?!), and leaves my face feeling unclean and irritated. \n\nI will not be repurchasing and will not recommend this product to anyone. I will let everyone I know who uses this product to start searching for a new option. Again I have been buying this product in bulk for years so this is truly devastating to me! \n\nLancome PLEASE bring back the old product! Please!",

As much as I've been caring for my skin, it seems the more clogged my pores were. I'd forgotten that I had this cleanser and started using it again. I have the trial size, but I'm going to purchase the largest size tomorrow. My pores are clean, my skin feels smooth, and it doesn't feel dry at all. I've been using other cleansers and haven't seen immediate results like with this one. If you are suffering from clogged pores and break outs, I highly recommend this cleanser.",

I got it in a GWP but it didn't work for me, after washing my face I use a toner and there was still tons of makeup on my face. I guess if I would have removed my makeup before washing it then I would have liked the results. I prefer face wash that will remove my makeup and I get to save time. Also it made me break out, I already struggle with adult acne, Im in my 30s, so anything that makes me break out I don't give a second chance. My sister liked it but she doesn't wear makeup but it did make her break out.",
