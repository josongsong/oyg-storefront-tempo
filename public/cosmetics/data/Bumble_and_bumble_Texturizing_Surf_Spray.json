I've tried applying less, applying to dry hair, and applying to damp hair; none of it makes a difference. My hair feels dry, stringy, and I can't even brush my fingers through my hair to fix it without getting stuck on the texture from the spray. Overall, this spray has not been a good experience.",

I needed a salt spray to set and hold my curls.  A REAL salt spray, not one with oil in it!!!!!!! this stuff is IT. I'll be buying the full sized bottle when the travel size runs out. I put this on last after my other products before I blow dry. I even add a little bit to dry hair and blow dry it a little more to really give my curls the hold they need. love this stuff.",

The formulation of the sea salt spray was okay; unfortunately the dispensing bottle was a trigger spray bottle. I found it very difficult to dispense in a consistent manner and usually ended up with far too much liquid on my hair. I just happened to be reading through the reviews of this company's spray when I came across one that mentioned the superiority the Bumble to Bumble sea salt spray. It's more expensive, however, I decided to order a bottle. I wasn't disappointed as the Bumble and Bumble bottle dispenses the spray in a mist. This makes for application of the product very easy and consistent over one's entire head. So, long story short I have decided to stick with this brand going forward. It's a great product.",

        "comments": "I have medium/thick wavy, frizzy, long hair. As a student, I'm constantly on the go and don't have as much time or patience for hairstyling anymore. I'm trying to rehab my damaged hair, so air drying is best, but I end up with so much frizz. I love Surf Spray because I can spritz it on, and it defines my waves/shape, gives a cool matte hold/finish, and even tones down some of the frizz! And I'm able to avoid any heat styling and still achieve a look. I've noticed that it has a more measurable effect on shorter styles. When I first bought it, I had hair just past my shoulders, and it reallyyy brought out the waves, the layers, and added some beachy volume. Now my hair has grown much longer and heavier, so the effect is a little less, but still very nice nonetheless. This is great for creating cool, edgy updos as well, as the spray will give a good texture to work with, but will also help hold the style in place for a long time.\nDon't spray too much in one area, you can always go back and add more. I like to spray it on damp hair, because then even if I did over-apply on one section, air drying will help soften the use of too much product. I've also noticed that you can bring out more of your hair's shape when you spray it on damp hair versus dry hair. I avoid putting too much on the root area, unless I want one spritz to try to encourage a lot of volume that day.\nThe only, smallest critique I have of this product is that the span of the spray is a bit wide, which took some getting use to, as the first time I aimed it at my hair, I ended up spraying half on my face because the nozzle covers such a large area. Over time you'll get used to it and learn how far away and where to hold your hand so you can direct the spritz right where you need it!\nI tried this on my friend with straight hair, and it encouraged a little waving, but overall gave her a messy/sexy texturized look, which was good because she has extremely fine hair, though I would not expect this product to create waves in straight hair if you have absolutely none.\nOverall incredible product! (And cool bottle design on top of everything else.)",
