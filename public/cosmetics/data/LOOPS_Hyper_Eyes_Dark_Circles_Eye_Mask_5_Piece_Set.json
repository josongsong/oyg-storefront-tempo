        "comments": "i LOVEE this genuinely so much. I use this in the morning before i do my full base of makeup. I only leave on for about 10-15 mins. Please take this from someone who is 20, works all the time, is stressed and tired 24/7. I mainly got these for my upcoming beach events because i want to wear as minimal makeup as i can, and i plan on only using a very light color corrector on my undereyes right after i take these off instead of a full on beat. These honestly have changed my life i love them so much i am going to be buying way more of these and looking into other products that LOOPS has available here online.",
