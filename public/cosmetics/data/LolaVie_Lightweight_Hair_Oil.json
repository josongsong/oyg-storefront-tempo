On the day of application my hair is shiny and smooth and my natural curls look great - no frizz. By the next day my hair is still shiny but not soft (at all) and crazy frizzy. The oil is truly lightweight for my fine hair but it did not deliver all the results advertised. Maybe I'd get better results if I blow dried or flat ironed my hair but the HOW TO USE section does include getting promised results if opt to not style with hot tools, which I did. This is definitely going to be returned and not recommended.",

It's lightweight, and great on finer hair. a little goes a long way; that being said, you don't have to use a lot and the bottle will last awhile, which is honestly the downfall of this product. It will go RANCID within less than a year. I had two bottles gifted from my job, and they both smelled absolutely awful after about 10 months. The formulation is quite nice and natural, but it shouldn't be going bad within a year.",

My natural hair texture is frizzy because of my grey hair. Right now I color my grey hair to different shades of blonde but coloring your greys doesn't help with the frizz. If you have grey hair, you know what I mean: grey hair is the karma you get because you didn't fully appreciate your 20-year old luscious locks.     So what do you do? You try to find haír oil to get that grey hair to calm down. Well, this is it. Lolavie is just perfect. It's not heavy, it's not greasy, not oily, but it's moisturizing. My hair is so soft - it feels like hair again and not a frizzy dry mess. See my photo -the products I used are Lolavie shamps, condi, leave-in and hair oil (at the time of the photo, I did not try the detangle spray yet.) and this is my hair just air dried and photo taken by the window. So are you kidding me?? I'm throwing out all my hair oils right now and am going to subscribe!",

        "comments": "Enjoy works as well... I'm so disappointed in all of these products. The oil weighted my hair and maybe by itself without the other leave ins my hair was better during the day - using all leave ins though .. OMG it was like a thickening glue .. something ... I had really hoped it would have worked better ... Yesterday I only used the only and let me hair jair dry - I have curls similar to JA - and started with a couple of drops and just added in a couple more a couple more times. --     This morning I decided to just flatten my hair. I don't like to wash it every day if I don't have it.. It was stiff ... very stiff .. I'll be going back to my old Pantene ...     Thanks for trying though.",
