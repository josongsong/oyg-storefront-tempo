It works really well, made my eyes look fresh and awake with just the right amount of moisturizing. BUT, It rolled off my shelf and it shattered everywhere! My reaction was verbatim what the last reviewer wrote. Why on earth would they make this out of glass?! I was so mad because it was pretty much brand new. Not only am I out an eye cream, but I am out money from the one that broke and had to buy another one (which I bubble wrapped just in case), which is even more money out. I'm still finding little pieces of glass on the floor. Overall, very disappointing.",

I have only tried one (from the body shop) and was not satisfied with it. I have heard a lot of good things about Korres so I just gave in and splurged and decided to buy this rollerball eye cream.\nI honestly love it. The application is easy and smooth, I have not had any issues with it at all, even when applying it over my serum. In fact it glides on even better then. I have been using it for about 2-3 weeks now and my under eyes are not clear of course, but I have noticed a vast difference from when I began using this. \nMy under eyes are a lot less dark, however some mild darkness is still present. My under eyes also stay super hydrated for a long time and when applying makeup, I no longer have a cakey under eye. \nI would definiltey give this one a go (:",

I have only tried one (from the body shop) and was not satisfied with it. I have heard a lot of good things about Korres so I just gave in and splurged and decided to buy this rollerball eye cream.\nI honestly love it. The application is easy and smooth, I have not had any issues with it at all, even when applying it over my serum. In fact it glides on even better then. I have been using it for about 2-3 weeks now and my under eyes are not clear of course, but I have noticed a vast difference from when I began using this. \nMy under eyes are a lot less dark, however some mild darkness is still present. My under eyes also stay super hydrated for a long time and when applying makeup, I no longer have a cakey under eye. \nI would definiltey give this one a go (:",

It works really well, made my eyes look fresh and awake with just the right amount of moisturizing. BUT, It rolled off my shelf and it shattered everywhere! My reaction was verbatim what the last reviewer wrote. Why on earth would they make this out of glass?! I was so mad because it was pretty much brand new. Not only am I out an eye cream, but I am out money from the one that broke and had to buy another one (which I bubble wrapped just in case), which is even more money out. I'm still finding little pieces of glass on the floor. Overall, very disappointing.",
