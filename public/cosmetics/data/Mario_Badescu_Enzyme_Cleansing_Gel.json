After the first wash, I looked like a racoon around my eyes. Instead of removing and washing away, the face gel basically smeared the makeup. The fragrance is pretty strong than most facial washes. You don't need a lot to use, which means it's taking me longer to get through this bottle. I will not purchase/recommend this product.",

Only thing of note is that it cannot be used on eyes or to remove makeup, but its no problem grabbing my micellar water before i start using this!",

It feels very lovely going on, and after a couple days my skin has started to feel softer and the scaly upper midwest winter skin that's been troubling me has gone. The aesthetician who helped me pick this out advised me to let it sit for two minutes on my skin in the evenings to let the enzymes work as she thought my skin was too sensitive for any kind of exfoliating product, I think that's really done the trick. I don't mind the scent, but other people may be put off by it.",

It is very gentle and at my age need that but it doesnt remove make up well enough for me ( though i wear much lighter make up now - quite frankly my skin looks better the older i get). This is the cleanser i use in the morning to freshen my skin and remove any extra nighttime  oil/ treatments. I use Gentle Foaming cleanser in the evening for make up removal and Glycolic Acid Toner both morning and night. Mario Badescu products will not fail you , are at a reasonable price point  and very effective once you find what works for you. I am very happy with their fairly new Clarifying serum IF i feel i'm starting to get a blemish ( which ive managed my entire life). It's magic and gentle!",

        "comments": "On the search for a good papaya-enzyme cleanser (more natural than 'Likas Papaya' soap which works well but isn't all that great for the skin's PH) and stumbled upon this. The concentration of Papaya in here isn't anywhere near as strong as Likas' soap but it does contain a natural AHA (Grapefruit extract) which would (hopefully) make up for it! Or would it? It works fairly well as a cleanser, although not as good at removing makeup as it's touted to be, had to double-cleanse on all days when trying to remove anything more than oil-free foundation. The fragrance is very strong which isn't a good thing in my books, and as the instructions state: leaving on for 1-2 minutes if you can, is worth doing, as the difference when doing so, compared to when I didn't, could be noticed immediately (smoother, brighter, more refined skin). All in all a fairly good cleanser, not as effective when it comes to brightening as Likas Papaya (despite the addition of that Graperfuit) but an acceptable alternative, considering it's not a bar of skin-stripping soap!\n-> My 'Ulta Beauty Top 7 must-have list' (My 7 favorite beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Ulta) < - < 1.

        "comments": "This is a good cleanser, but it is not the best that I have used.  I have combination/oily skin for most of the year and normal to dry-combination in the heart of the winter.  I bought this product at the beginning of February 2013, and I have used it every morning and night.  It is non-irritating and does not leave the skin with a tight, stripped feeling.  It works especially well as a morning cleanser when I'm just washing away any sweat / oil production from the night and don't have any makeup to remove.  The issue that I have  with this product is that at night, even if I use a makeup wipe before cleansing my face, I feel that all this product does is remove the residual makeup.  Often times, I'll have to wash my face twice just to feel like the product has penetrated through to my skin.  \n\nI will say that this product worked better for my skin in the winter/early spring months than it did throughout the summer.  It could be because my skin type changed or it could be that my skin built up some kind of tolerance to it.  I would definitely give it a shot as it has not caused any bad side effects for me... I just don't think it's the best product for my personal skin care needs. [On a side note--I have recently switched to Philosophy's purity and it seems to be better at getting my combo skin truly clean]\n\nI'm torn between giving this product 3 and 4 stars, but I have gone with 4 because the product is well-priced.",

I do not have sensitive skin and I never break out using new products. I have mostly clear skin with the occasional breakout. I have the seaweed cleanser and this one was on sale so I decided to give it a try last night. This morning, the entire bottom of my face/jaw/chin is broken out in a red, heated, itchy rash (it's as gross as it sounds). I'm hoping with discontinued use that it will go away but I'm struggling to even cover it with makeup. I will never buy this product again and be very cautious with this brand in the future.",
