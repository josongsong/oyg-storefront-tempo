I think they changed the formula a bit because the fragance before was so fresh and lovely-smelling, it's still great, but doesn't have that same lovely smell.  It is creamy and gentle, perfect for every day.  The only downside is the bottle.  It used to come in a glass jar, which was perfect, but they switched to the bottle and now sometimes you can't even get the product out with the pump (as was the case on my latest order).  It is kind of annoying to try to fish it out with the pump stick, but the product is so lovely.  I REALLY wish they would go back to the jar though!  Otherwise it would be 5 stars!",

I gave it -2 weeks to see if it just needed to work its way through but I think the pump is designed for the viscosity of a liquid, not a rich cream like this.   I am also bummed that this doesn't remove my makeup (specifically eyeliner and mascara) very well. I wear Erin's Face mascara and Elate eyeliner (clean beauty, nothing waterproof) and I still need to use a cleansing balm on my eyes after using this cleanser (the cleanser I used before this took everything off super easily and rinsed away very clean).   I will continue buying EH Azure, Celestine, Anchor, and Siren Silk but will probably go back to Plaine Peoducts for my cleanser.",
