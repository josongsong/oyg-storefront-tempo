One day, however, a certain shade of eyeshadow caught my eye and I bought it. (though that voice in my head was going $15!?!? seriously?!?!)\n\nWell, I took it home and started wearing it and I noticed from the first time that it didn't fade the way my other ones always do. Later when the summer time came and I was working in a hot room and sweating I noticed that the eyeshadow still looked like I just put it on at the end of the day. When put on over the paint pots as a base you can actually have sweat or water roll down your eyelid and take a dry towel or tissue and just blot it dry real quick and IT STILL LOOKS GOOD!!\n\nI gradually started replacing all my drugstore eyeshadows with these from MAC. One day I was swatching them all on the back of my hand and then I had to go off and do dishes... after submerging my hands completely in warm water the eyeshadows were still on the back of my hand!! I had to put soap directly on them and rub a little before they came off - but this impressed me enough that now I don't think anything of paying $15 for these guys.",

        "comments": "I love MAC products and the color selection for the eyeshadows are so beautiful! But sadly I was disappointed with the eyeshadow formula. It's patchy, dry, and the color barely shows up and is so faint. I purchased Parfait Amour (which barely showed up and is even hard to swatch) and Creme De Violet (which performed a lot better than Parfait Amour but still needed more pigmentation). To get these colors to work, I had to use a very generous layer of sticky eyeshadow primer. Using my regular silky eyeshadow primer did nothing with these shades and they didn't show up well. MAC, I love your color selection and the colors I bought and I'd buy more, but only if you work on your formula!",
