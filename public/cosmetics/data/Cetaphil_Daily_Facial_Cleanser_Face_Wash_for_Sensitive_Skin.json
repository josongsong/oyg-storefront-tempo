I would recommend to use their face lotion afterwards, or else you might find your face feeling dry.

And am still happy to be a customer... although being a graphic designer id like to point out how important how design truly matters especially in this situation. I recently bought the daily face cleanser when I meant to buy the gentle face cleanser. They look almost identical. My face does not so well with fragrances and as soon as I opened the bottle I could smell the perfumey smell :/ I'm really hoping I can take it back to trade it in! I've been using the products for a long time and they really help my acne proned skin - I'm so thankful for the company! Just hope they do a re branding (different color options choose different hierarchy placements of font choices or something to make it look different than the other new options available. It's great to have options but we also love the original products ! Thanks :)",
