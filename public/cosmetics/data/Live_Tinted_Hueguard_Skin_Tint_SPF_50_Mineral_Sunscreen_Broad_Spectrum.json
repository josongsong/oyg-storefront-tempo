Sometimes it gets clogged so you have to keep pressing down repeatedly until it sprays out, staining whatever it meets in the process. It can get messy and wasteful.

It did take me three tries to find the correct color, and do wish there were more neutral options. However, I found it and I'm thrilled! I have hyperpigmentation and had sun spots burned off, from using baby oil to bake in the sun in my 20s, leaving uneven skin tones. This product covers my face like a medium to full coverage foundation and doesn't look like there's anything on my skin. It's a bit too shiny for my taste, so I press a thin bit of triple-milled setting powder on top and I look flawless all day! I'm SO happy with this product and I highly recommend it!",

So for the last 6ish months I have been researching tinted mineral sunscreens because as a black woman i REFUSE to be out here looking ashy. After reading so many reviews and comparisons, I landed on this one. Y'all…the way it matched my olive undertone and skin color PERFECTLY, evened my skin, and felt so hydrating without looking greasy??? I'm so shook. On most days I can't be bothered with makeup. I might put it on once a week if I'm feeling fancy. It's too much, I hate how heavy it feels on my skin, and the transfer to my clothes/hands/etc is too annoying. But this???? It just feels like I have my regular sunscreen on. I also have combo/dry skin and my skin absolutely LOVES this stuff. And it's quick. I just slather it on, maybe add some bronzer to give some dimension and some mascara. I hope this never gets discontinued. I will be a customer for the long haul. Holy grail status!!!!! Thank you!!!",

        "comments": "I loved this product, the formula is great. Dewy but it stays put and isn't greasy. I only gave 2 stars because i cannot stand the smell. It smells like a dog's anal gland fluid. Iykyk. It's faint enough I didnt notice until after i applied it, but still it ruined my evening. i kept getting a whiff of it. I couldn't believe it was the makeup so i gave it a couple days, tried it again and immediately i noticed the scent before i even applied it to my face. \n\nI recommend 100% if you have no sense of smell or that smell doesnt bother you. Again, its kind of faint but strong enough to ruin it for me. I've yet to find another product that wears the same unfortunately. It would've beem a HG product. My fiance didn't smell it (thankfully) but a couple of my frienda ageed it was not pleasant. \n\nThis is the first produt i had to return due to smell issues.",
