This hurts less when purchased during a 21 days of beauty-type event, but even so, other retailers are still offering the larger size, so I would recommend purchasing this elsewhere.",

I will say while working there I fell in love with many of the products I got to use on my clients and myself. This exfoliating cleanser is gentle enough to use 3x a week and is ok for dry, oily and combo skin. I love how my skin feels after using this stuff. The only con for me is the price tag but if you have the extra $ to buy the full size bottles it's definitely worth it and should last you a long time.",

(VERY oily, dries out easily, large pores, weird small acne bumps, redness) \n\nI would go from product to product to product and I would never find one that really made a difference. I even tried Murad's acne cleanser (blue bottle) and I did notice a slight improvement. But after about 8 months of use I said eh its not enough and went on the hunt again. \n\nI searched the Ulta website to see what were the best sellers and this came up. I scoped it out. I have read so many good things about the ingredients included in this product and along with the great reviews (on here and other sites I check them all)I said I MUST try this. I am so glad I did. \n\nIn just a few washes I could see my pores become smaller, my skin felt smooth and soft but in no way dry or stripped. My redness is almost nothing and my weird little bumps have gone away. I have used this product for a good month now and I am in love with it. So much so that I'm going to be purchasing a pairing product from this line from Murad to use with it. (some soft of moisturizer) \n\nI am glad to say that I am done looking for a face wash product. This is it. \n\nSide note, I did not notice a huge improvement on the oiliness of my skin. It still remained about that same. However, I am fully aware that is just my skin type and not a whole lot can really change that. But for those of you looking for that info there ya go. :)",

I bought this product because I've been on a lengthy search to find something to help clean out my pores and serve as an exfoliant.  It smells super clean and leaves your skin feeling the same way and polished at the same time with the help of little beads inside.  When I started using this product, my skin wasn't bad at all I just had problems with blackheads and enlarged pores on my nose as I said above.  I used this product twice in the span of a week as instructed and everything was fine at first, but within a few days of the second use my skin broke out like crazy.  I got pimples where I've never had them before like on my cheeks and forehead.  When this happened I thought it was just purging everything out of my skin but this breakout lasted for WEEKS.  I have no idea if it was an allergic reaction, I didn't have any puffiness but this product didn't work for me at all.  I'm not trying to bash this product, just sharing my experience because I know I find it helpful to read both good and bad reviews on products to really get the full scoop.  My guess is that the chemicals in it were too drying for my skin causing it to overproduce oil.",
