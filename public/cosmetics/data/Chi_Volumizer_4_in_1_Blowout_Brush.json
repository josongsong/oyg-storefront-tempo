I like the bristles on the round brush, I believe this is lighter than the high end ones and the torque is better. Left my hair feeling soft and manageable. It doesn't get as hot as the other high end brands but that wasn't something I was needing. I believe the air blows the same amount as the high end styles. if you want bang for your buck and it does the same job then this is worth it! ill be keeping.",

It is now May of 2025 and it is working as good as when i first purchased the product. The attachments do get hot so take them off when the dryer cools and set it on a silicone mat so it doesnt burn anything. Cleaning the brush attachment after every use is necessary. Always store in a place that is not humid and always make sure the bottom of the dryer where the wires are is always able to vent and move.",

I hollered for help because it was still flaming and a friend of mine ran in and unplugged. The bottom where the plug was attached to the blow dryer was melted and it burned my vanity. I am relieved that it did not happen to one of my three daughters.  This product can be very dangerous. I attempted to contact the company by phone and a formatted response says \"sorry we are unable to complete your call goodbye\" the it disconnects.Then I tried contacting the operator and it just plays music and no one ever answers then again it finally gives that same response as before and once again disconnects. I am very disappointed and I am shocked that a corporation this big has such poor customer service.",

It looks like I got a professional blowout at a salon, which is a look I've never once been able to achieve on my own at home with any products or styling tools before, and even better - it was SO easy (and even fun). I've only used the oval brush attachment so far, and now I understand why an oval barrel on all these newer stylers is more effective than a round one - the way it allows you to start right at the scalp and style up and out is a much more natural movement than trying to get a round brush close to the root and move it in the same way. I've used a round brush and dryer for years and never had good results since it's difficult to blow dry the \"professional\" way to get salon results. Since this tool combines the two, the process takes practically no work or thought. How I used it: Towel dried my hair and let it air dry a bit so it's damp but not wet. Couple of sprays of a leave-in conditioner, combed through. Then I blow-dried in small sections (that's key!). Make sure to pass the dryer through more slowly; I only had to do about 2 passes through each section before it was completely dry and styled. The results: SUPER smooth, bouncy, and volumized hair. I had no need to flat iron to achieve smoothness. I'm excited to try the other attachments, especially the diffuser for my naturally 3a/b curly hair. The only thing I worry about down the road is that the clips inside that hold the attachments in place might break since they're just plastic.",

I have avoided these brush dryers, because I have long, naturally curly hair and figured it was a disaster waiting to happen. I decided to give the Chi a go since I wouldn't be stuck with just a round brush. I tried the flat paddle brush first and that didn't go well. It was hard to work with and I couldn't get the area by my roots to straighten very well. Next, I used it as a a straight up hair dryer. It gets hot enough, but doesn't blow enough air, so drying took forever. I finally gave in and tried the round brush attachment and I was hooked! I section of small areas to work with and it worked great!! I was even able to get the areas by the roots! I used it 3-4 times weekly for 5 months and then it stopped working correctly. It still worked, but only cold air blew out. I returned it and decided (fingers crossed) to give it another go, because that's how happy I was with it and even after having read prior reviews of this issue. My second purchase worked equally as great, but then after TWO months the air stopped blowing out as much and it got super hot within seconds of turning it on. RIP to my 2nd Chi. I love how it works, I was willing to give it another try, but sadly I was disappointed and now I'm in search of another brand, because now I'm hooked on the ease of styling my hair. It dries, straightens and even curls my hair, all in one swoop!",
