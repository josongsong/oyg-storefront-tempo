Not sure but either way here my review... feels very soft and smooth when u apply it. No stickyness so that nice. It looks like it doesnt do much at first but on the days I dont wear it I look way more tired . Im 33 and dont have dark circles but im a mom and I basically look tired 24/7. My opinion is if you have under eye bags and looking tired is your concern this would work good for you. I would describe this as an under eye blurring cream for tired eyes. The texture is like a cream product and serium made a baby. Very smooth different texture then most products I've tried.",

Because my eye concealer does not cake or settle in the micro lines if I apply this underneath as moisturizer for my eyes. My eyes look great for my age; I don't show my age because I believe this has prevented my eyes from the lines around and under my eyes.",

The description states special optics \"act like magic\" to fade away lines, there is nothing magic about it. I wish companies would stop making products to sound as if they are miracle products. It does leave the eye area feeling silky though and the formula is very smooth. I won't repurchase especially at the price it is.",
