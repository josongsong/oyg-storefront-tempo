The Charlotte Tilbury Lip Cheat Liner in the shade Red Carpet Red is a game-changer for anyone looking to achieve impeccable lip precision. This lip liner is more than just a tool; it's an essential element in crafting a flawless, red-carpet-ready pout.\nWhat immediately stands out is its creamy texture, which effortlessly glides onto the lips, creating a smooth and even base. The Red Carpet Red shade, a vibrant and classic red, complements a spectrum of lip colors, making it versatile for various lipstick pairings.\nPrecision is the key strength of this liner. The fine tip allows for precise outlining, preventing feathering or bleeding of lip color. This meticulous application ensures that your lips look defined and polished, enhancing the overall appearance of your makeup.\nThe longevity of the Lip Cheat Liner is what lacked for me. While a great liner and helped hold the lipstick more inside the area of the lips better, it wasn't long lasting enough for me.. it actually came off in a matter of a couple hours and did long last for any eating. Charlotte Tilbury's Red Carpet Red Lip Cheat Liner is more than a beauty product; it's a tool for achieving lip perfection, allowing you to confidently stride onto your own metaphorical red carpet, wherever life takes you.",

I dont understand how its my perfect nude and so many others. \n\nTHEN, after using I noticed when I caught a glimpse of myself in a mirror, that the lip liner had like bleed or smudged into my skin off of my lip line. Thinking it was a smudge, i tried again….and it happened again. Thus determining: the lip liner bleeds off of my lips and into my skin and away from my lips, staining it….which is not super fun. \n\nThis deeply saddens me because i loved the color so much. So Sometimes when i want live life dangling on cliff of uncertainty, always having to think: \"is my lip liner smudged like crazy around my mouth like a clown, and do i look crazy without knowing it?\"…i still wear it out because of the color.",
