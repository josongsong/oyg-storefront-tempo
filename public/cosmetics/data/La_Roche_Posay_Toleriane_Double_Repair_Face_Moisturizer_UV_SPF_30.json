I have been using this moisturizer for several months now, and I don't think I can ever live without it. I recently started medication for my acne-prone skin, and it was so difficult for me to find a moisturizer gentle enough for my now dry, flaky skin. Every moisturizer I tried would work for 10 minutes and then soak in and leave my skin irritated and drier than before. But this  provides just the right amount of moisture, leaving my skin looking healthy and glowy all day long, which is a miracle for my skin right now! It also lasts a really long time--the tube may look small but a little bit goes a long way!",

        "comments": "This product claims to be for all skin types, but I completely disagree. I have combination skin with oily T-zone, sensitive, and mild redness on cheeks. This product is very thick. I'm sure it's because you are suppose to use a good amount for a full sun protection. I would not mind it if it absorbs quickly, but unfortunately it doesn't. It takes 1-2 hours to absorb completely even in the Arizona dry climate. After it does absorb, it leaves my skin really soft. And a big big plus is that it does not cause my skin to break out or cause irritation to my sensitive skin (when used alone without layering). It did cause irritation when I layered it with a different product, so keep that in mind. I really wanted it work, but I don't like the heavy feeling on my face before it absorbs. I'm sure this would work very well on people with dry skin.",
