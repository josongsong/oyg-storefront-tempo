        "comments": "I used to work at a Lush cosmetics store and basically switched over all my previous hair and skin care(philosophy/it's a 10/pureology) once I tried many of their products and lived them to bits. After seeing such a difference in my skin and hair with more natural/fresh ingredients I was sold on keeping my hair n skin care as natural as I can. Fast forward to now: I don't work there anymore and don't have the amazing 50% employee discount. So I ran out of my toner from lush and figured now is a good time to try something new and different but reasonably priced and more natural as well. Saw this for $5 and have fallen in love. I didn't think I'd find a toner better than the one I used for the same or cheaper price and I have. The rose scent is strong but I LOVE rose so it's a relaxing scent to me. The rose is softening/reduces redness and great for sensitive skin as it calms. The aloe is hydrating and softening and slumps the skin. Rosemary in this is great for oil control even for those who are dry. I've been using it morning before my moisturizer and primer for makeup and at night after I cleanse and follow up with derma e overnight peel or serum then moisturizer. When I'm out I'm stocking up and buying the larger size.",

        "comments": "I got a sample of their facial spray. They do not put all the ingredients on the small bottle. They only say active ingredients which of course are all great. I ordered several bottles for myself, coworker and sister online. When I get the larger bottles I realize the active ingredients (all the good/natural sounding stuff) are very low on the ingredient list which means the product does not has have much of thosd ingredients in it. It's water and the second (which means it's a main ingredient) is propylene glycol. This is the main ingredient in antifreeze. It's really bad for you. But cheaper companies use it in several beauty products. If it's lower on the ingredient list it may be ok to use but in this case it's not. I ended up googling the brand and saw several lawsuits against them for bad ingredients in their products :( There are several other great facial sprays that have natural ingredients. Stick to those.",
