        "comments": "I came across this line by random chance after receiving it in a three piece trial. Immediately after using the trial, I went on the line and ordered the set. I have struggled with skin issues for about 10 years now. Even though I no longer get acne, I'm constantly struggling with dullness, large pores, and oiliness, all while my skin feels dry and tight. I flipped through many different drugstore face washes that I thought I liked, but never got better results. After using this line for the first time, I immediately noticed a difference in my skins brightness and texture. When I get out of the shower, my skin no longer feels tight and like it's going to crack. It gives me a glow with the softest feeling skin. Overall, my skin just looks and feels so much healthier. I love the creaminess of the face wash and how well it lathers. A little really goes a long way with all three of the products in this line. After about a month of using all three in this line, I went to get my eyebrows done by my aesthetician, and she immediately asked me when I was doing different on my skin and complimented how well it looked. After 10 years, I feel like I finally found something that is a game changer for me at a reasonable price.",

Some positives about this are that it smells good, and a very small amount goes a long way. The way a small amount bubbles up and increases in volume is impressive.

I've been using this as more of a body wash to avoid the squeaky clean feeling on my face, and much prefer using it as a body cleanser.",
