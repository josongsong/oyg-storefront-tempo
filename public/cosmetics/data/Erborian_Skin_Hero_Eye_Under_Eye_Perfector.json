I was hoping not to like the Skin Hero Eye as it is more than I would usually spend on an eye cream. Unfortunately, I LOVE it! I have always had dark circles under my eyes and my skin has recently started to show signs of crepiness. I have been using Skin Hero Eye for about 3 weeks now. My dark circles are less noticeable and my skin is less crepey and feels more hydrated. The only negative thing that I can say is that it has a 3 month use by symbol and there is no way I can use a full tube in that time as you need such a tiny amount each day. Perhaps it would be better, and certainly more cost effective, to sell a smaller tube with a lower price point that is more likely to be used up in a timely manner.",
