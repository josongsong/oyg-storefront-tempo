Enough of the bad, time for the good! I get the wide slacks and they look exactly like the eyelashes I used to have, I used to have really long lashes but I have trichotillomania which is a disorder where I pull out my hair so I no longer have eyelashes or eyebrows but back in the day when I did have them, these eyelashes resemble as such! My disorder is really confidence draining but these eyelashes make me feel so good and confident about myself so I'm very thankful for them! They are a bit stiff out of the package (like most new lashes) so I recommend kind of grabbing either end and just bending it so it makes an arch shape, make your lashes do yoga haha! When I first got them, I didn't really know how to put on lashes but there is a wrong and right way! if you put them on wrong, they can appear flat and not lifting but if you do it right, they'll be long and lifted! I followed Brooke Monks tutorial on how she puts on her lashes and it worked perfectly for the wide slacks!! 10/10 recommend these!",

        "comments": "I get these every 1-2 months, these are absolutely the best but I have one problem, sometimes in the packaging they get bent incorrectly causing some of the lashes to go a bit wonky so then I don't use one of the pairs, I also wish they could be reused more, mine tend to collect oil really fast causing the lashes to look a bit messy but that could just be user error!! Enough of the bad, time for the good! I get the wide slacks and they look exactly like the eyelashes I used to have, I used to have really long lashes but I have trichotillomania which is a disorder where I pull out my hair so I no longer have eyelashes or eyebrows but back in the day when I did have them, these eyelashes resemble as such! My disorder is really confidence draining but these eyelashes make me feel so good and confident about myself so I'm very thankful for them! They are a bit stiff out of the package (like most new lashes) so I recommend kind of grabbing either end and just bending it so it makes an arch shape, make your lashes do yoga haha! When I first got them, I didn't really know how to put on lashes but there is a wrong and right way! if you put them on wrong, they can appear flat and not lifting but if you do it right, they'll be long and lifted! I followed Brooke Monks tutorial on how she puts on her lashes and it worked perfectly for the wide slacks!! 10/10 recommend these!",

        "comments": "Super fluffy and lightweight. Band is clear. Not practical for everyday UNLESS you have big beautiful eyes! They were way too big for my liking but every other aspect I really liked.  KISS always makes lashes affordable and so I appreciate the value the bigger pack gives. Personally, I'd go for something smaller but with the same subtlety. Overall great brand and great lightweight BIG lash if that's what you're searching for. The glue is also super. Held onto the lashes and my lash line with no primer. I also have very oily eyelids so I was very impressed. It also dried clear so huge benefit.",
