        "comments": "I purchased this because I needed to replace my previous toner that was discontinued. I should have read the \"how to use\" section before purchasing because I didn't realize that this is only meant to be used 3 to 5 times per week. The first time I used it with my nighttime skincare routine, my cheeks were very red and inflamed the next morning. About a week later, I decided to try it again. In addition to red cheeks, the irritation had spread to my nose and chin as well. I have never had sensitive skin, so I'm surprised that this irritated my skin so much. I think maybe this product is just too harsh for me.",

        "comments": "This toner is really good for exfoliating skin quickly if you like chemical rather than physical exfoliation. As for the other review, I do think some of these ingredients aren't tolerated well by those with sensitive skin, but for people like me, with resistant skin, those ingredients can be very good. Skin care is not universal, so different people benefit from various combos of ingredients. This worked just fine for my oily, mature skin, and didn't break me out. It isn't for those with sensitive skin, though, as it is a bit too harsh. What I didn't like was the dispenser (push down on the top and it comes out.) When I would push down, it squirted out everywhere no matter how tightly I held the cotton pad to it. I would much rather have a pump or just pour it out myself.",

Also a huge plus (for me at least) is the bottle design. This is perfect to use with a cotton pad, less mess and honestly just looks so cute too.",

After a few weeks of use, twice a week in my PM routine on my face (T-zone area) and as a body exfoliant, my skin feels refreshed, clean, soft and it gives an instant glow. I like the pump dispenser, so that the toner can be used when it's still sitting upright on the vanity top. I apply the toner with cotton pads, but you can also pump it directly into your hands.\n\nSince I have sensitive combo skin, I did feel stinging when I apply on my face, but not on other body areas. lt helps to clarify the pores, remove any dirt and resurface bumpy texture. However, I haven't noticed any major difference with my dark spots and pores size. Personally I don't really like a stinging sensation on my face, so this toner is better as a body exfoliant for me. Also, be mindful that this toner does contain essential oils, so I won't recommend if you are sensitive to EO oils.",

The product itself was light and absorbed into my skin easily. However, the dispenser was an absolute pain to use without cotton pads. I don't use cotton pads because I don't want to create unnecessary waste, and was surprised this brand that prides itself on a low environmental impact created this product in a way that promotes the generation of unnecessary waste. I also didn't see any improvement in my skin from regular use. I do use it for my underarms because the smell doesn't bother me as much, and it helps with staying sweat free. Unfortunately this product is not for me.",
