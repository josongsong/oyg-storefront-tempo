So i watched a few tiktok tutorials on how to style natural hair. I saw a lot of people using these products and when i saw the sample pack i knew this would be great to try. The only additional product I used was Ouai's Leave in conditioner. I put that im my freshly washed hair, rhen used prayer hands to apply curl cream, combed through. Then applied the mousse using prayer hands, scrunched. Then added gel scrunched with a t shirt to remove excess product. Finally I used a diffuser to dry roots and then scrunched section by section with the deffuser and my curls came out perfect. Took about 20 mins.",

When I put this product in, I was super excited and it was very easy and simple to apply. I scrunched my hair and it was looking way better than usual, but I was worried it wasn't going to last... and I was right. They lasted as long as if I don't use the product and what's the purpose if it only looks good when I'm going to sleep? The products smell good but for me they didn't do much of a difference. Also, my hair felt dry and my head was a bit itchy in the morning. I hope they will work the next time I use!",

I've been learning how to style my 2b/3a waves/curls and was recommended this line. I'm not sure what the cream does but I use that and the gel on wash days. Don't be afraid to use too much gel, you can just scrunch it out if need be, but I never had to. I don't think I initially used enough! It has a much softer hold than the mousse, so you gotta use more product. I'm going to buy the full sized of the gel and cream because I liked those, will continue to test out the mousse and see. I would say this lasted for like 3-4 washes, enough to know whether I liked it or not/it worked, etc.",

        "comments": "This is a great set to try these products without spending full price for each item. However, I am not fully in love. I will describe why below: \n\nFirst, I am not a fan of the smell. Each product leaves a very pungent odor on your hair that I can only describe as a fake fragrance/product alcohol type smell. I could smell this stuff even after I showered thoroughly the next day. \n\nSecond, if your hair is not fully wavy this stuff will NOT help create those waves. I found a major difference in the results if I plopped my hair first to bring out my waves before applying product rather than just scrunching my hair with these products and not plopping my hair. The products themselves just have no hold to them to help you achieve and lock in those waves/curls. \n\nThird, my hair felt like it had product in it and did not feel soft. It actually felt uncomfortable throughout the day. However, when I looked at my hair in the mirror, my hair looked shiny and not like it had a hard cast of product in it which was nice. Just felt producty. \n\nFourth, major product buildup. I got these little white dots everywhere in my hair the day after using these products which was NOT cute. My guess based on application would be the cream and gel do not seem to work well together. \n\nAll in all, if you have naturally wavy or curly hair these should be fine. However, if you want a product that will help give you more waves/curls I would look elsewhere. Also if you are sensitive to smells I would stay away. I am glad I tried this because in the end, I like to keep a curl cream on hand for when I curl my hair and this will work perfectly. But for me, I am just not a fan of these products if I were to use them for a natural wave routine because my hair needs more help than these can offer.",
