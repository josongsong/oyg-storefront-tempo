Personally, I did not find that the cleansing balm worked well for my skin and I always hoped Oak would come out with something else. This is exactly what I was looking for! It is gentle, nourishing, and doesn't leave a film on the skin but also doesn't make the skin feel dry and stripped. The bottle is also huge and a little really does go a long way. My ONLY request is that Oak Essentials includes this as an option when purchasing the routine. I would LOVE to buy the full set with this cleanser instead of the balm.",

If you check the Jenni Kayne website, there are multiple complaints about the strap of sandal being so large that the shoe won't stay on. Contacted customer service and no resolution. Won't buy from here again.",
