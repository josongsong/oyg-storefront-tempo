My hair is very protein sensitive, so this provides a good option for when I want to stay away from protein yet still need deep conditioning. \nIt can be hard to rinse-out thoroughly, so it's definitely worth the extra time and effort to make sure and rinse carefully. My biggest complaint is that it does ZERO to help detangle. This product doesn't have much slip, so I always have to follow it with a lightweight detangling conditioner, or im left with tons of nasty tangles. \n     ALL of this said, my hair feels and looks so nice after using this product, its worth combatting the quirks! Its hard to find a good, moisturizing conditioner that doesn't contain protein, so I'm definitely going to keep repurchasing.",

        "comments": "Wow! Y'all this is a dense cream, I was afraid my hair couldn't hold this and be greasy. But I was dealing with protein overload and saw the great reviews for this so I ordered. I put a small amount of this on my hair and thought I'd take my blow dryer to this to help some of the oils penetrate, not long just a few minutes enough to get it warm. I jumped in the shower and shampoo and conditioned with biolage moisture shampoo and and prayed my hair wasn't going to be laying in a flat greasy mess when I got out. This rinsed out very easily and I almost thought did it even do anything? Till I got out, and went to carefully untangle my hair with my dentangling brush, which normally has a rough time and it slid thru like butter. I couldnt believe it, and I didn't feel as if I had a heavy residue or anything in my hair either! Now here is the crazy part, I let my hair air dry 80% and done the last bit with a blow dryer like always, can you imagine the surprise when my lifelong limp hair had VOLUME. That I was NOT expecting! Nothing added to my hair or anything it was just full and had life! I can't even get that with a ton of products and even then my hair is left tacky and will be even worse off from the weight the following day so I just don't do it. I have straight fine thin hair that has always been highlighted (although not in the last 8 months 😩 thanks Covid) I don't know if I am more blown away that my hair is so well moisturized or that it has volume! I am more than thankful to run across this product and for all the detailed reviews you all left that helped me decide to get this, thank you!!!",

        "comments": "Hair type: My curly type is constantly ranging from 2c-3a. I have a lot of fine, naturally dirty blonde hair that has been continuously bleached to platinum since about 2016. Every time after I get any sort of bleaching done on my hair, I will immediately put a hair mask on and it usually rejuvenates it very well and (along with avoiding heat at all costs) my hair feels extremely healthy until it is bleached again. \n\nMY HAIR FELT HORRIBLE after I did a 30 minute deep moisturizing treatment. This was immediately my hair had been through more than usual that day with bleaching. It felt horrible and DRY the next week until I showered again and it did nothing for my curls. If anything they were too dry to curl well and nicely. Essentially this product made my hair look horrible. \n\nI tried to give it another chance and did a 15 minute \"quick moisture boost\" in the shower the next week. You know how when you put on a hair mask or even conditioner you can feel your hair becoming softer as you apply or rinse the product out? This did not happen with me. As I was putting it on it felt horrible and as I was rinsing it out it felt horrible. I had to apply my conditioner on top of it to salvage my poor hair (shout out to Moroccan oil conditioner!) \n\nI saw some reviews of people complaining about the smell. My sense of smell isn't extremely sensitive but it's not that bad if you just take a small sniff of it, taking a giant sniff though will be overwhelming. It doesn't make your hair smell overwhelming but of course your hair will have the smell. Describing smells isn't my strong suit but I would say it's a weird combination of starburst smell and possibly coconut oil. Honestly that is the least of your worries with this product though. \n\nIf you have my hair type, DO NOT WASTE $35 ON THIS LIKE I DID!!",
