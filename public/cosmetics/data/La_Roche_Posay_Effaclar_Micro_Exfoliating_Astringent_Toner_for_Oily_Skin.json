I also noticed that it helped clear away some of my blackheads on my nose, but most of them are still there.",

But, I found as I entered my 60's, my skin was becoming dryer ( I've had oily skin, without many breakouts, all my life. Upside? No wrinkles). This particular toner didn't help anymore.\r\nI started using La Roche-Posay products last year...micellar warer, various cleansers..and liked them. Decided to give this toner a try.\r\nIn a word..wonderful! It's lightweight, non-drying. Makes my skin feel clean, and that I've gotten rid of every last trace of cleanser. \r\nIt has a water-like feel to it, which is what I love about it.\r\nI've tried other brands' \"gentle\" toners. All of them left a film on my face. This one does not.\r\nMy only complaint is that it doesn't come in a larger size. I go through a bottle a month!\r\nLike I mentioned, I was a dedicated customer of another brand for over 40 years. Not anymore. La Roche-Posay is my new \"go-to\" brand for skin care.",
