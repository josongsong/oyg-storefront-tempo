        "comments": "This really is a pretty foundation. I bounce a damp Beauty Blender to blend it over my face and neck.  I don't recommend more than one pump, because it can look heavy if more is used.  It has light reflection properties like Nars Light Reflecting (another favorite of mine), and it can look a bit ghostly in the right(wrong) light.  In Double Wear, I've worn Desert Beige and figured it would be an identical shade in Futurist, but it's not, and I think it's the light reflecting ingredients that make it lighter.  Fortunately, Desert Beige in Double Wear is now too dark for me, so this shade in Futurist is working pretty well.  Also, I've noticed that this foundation can separate and cling too dry patches if I  over-hydrate under it.  I will repurchase this foundation when I run out.",

        "comments": "I've been searching for the right foundation for my maturing skin for awhile. My go-to drug store brands just weren't cutting it anymore and I've been so tired of the orangey tinge that I'm left with.  Even after trying a few of the nicer brands, I was still left with the orangey oxidation/dry down.  \nI had read reviews on this brand & there were many that highly suggested it. When I had been in store, I finally asked an associate what they recommend for mature skin & they led me to this. They matched my tone & I was excited to give it a go. She asked if I needed concealer and I declined because I usually just build my foundation around as one. I have my new foundation a shot & I absolutely loved it. It's buildable for those problem areas. My only problem was I wasn't thinking when I purchased that this has SPF (45 SPF) and if you're using it too close to your eyes, it will leave them burning/irritated. Needless to say, that's where my problem areas are & I build more heavily around the eyes. My eyes were watering so bad. I didn't want to return the foundation because I loved it so much so I ended up going back for the concealer.  It all works so perfectly together and I'm no longer dealing with trying to blend in orangey make up lines. This foundation dries down and doesn't change shades.  I highly recommend!",

        "comments": "I am 1W2 Sand color and it matches really well. I'm Hispanic but I have fair skin with both pink and yellow undertones. This color matches me perfectly. I used to wear the Estée Lauder Double Wear because it was non transferable. My gripe with that foundation was it was drying for my aging, dry, large pore face. I had to mix it with Lancôme foundation to get the perfect combo of hydration. I had used the other Estée Lauder hydration foundation and that was a bust. It slid off my face. It was too hydrating and transferred everywhere. So when I saw futurist, I decided to give it a try. It goes on so smoothly (I use brush) on my skin and I don't have to use a lot. Start with a little, because it gives great coverage, especially when it sets. I didn't realize that I put too much foundation the first time. You don't know until it dries and you realize your face looks cakey. So the next time I put a little amount and rubbed it all over my face, set it and it was perfect. In the beginning of application, I figured since it feels so hydrating that maybe I don't need moisturizer before and I need to set it with a lot of powder. I was wrong. Once that foundation sets, which can take a little long, it looks a little dry if you didn't moisturize or set your face with too much powder. It's kind of a trial and error but it's worth it. You just have to know your skin. It lasted a long time. Even with a mask on in the hot sun. Toward the very end of the night, it started to separate but I noticed that when I didn't moisturize that day and set it with too much powder. So that could be the reason. All in all, I think it's a great foundation and it's worth giving a try. FYI it does have a strong SPF smell which I love bc it smells like you're at the beach. For those who don't like the SPF smell, then you won't like this foundation.",

        "comments": "I give this product a 3 star because I didn't really like the flaky look it gives. The color I received was the 2C3 Fresco which was on point with my skin tone which I did like a lot. All because I'm in between colors when it comes to my skin tone & it's very hard to find something close, so saying this was on point was great! The foundation itself went on smoothly it was indeed very light so don't expect it to come out slowly I do indeed like the little pump it has but wish it was a little thicker in consistency. (I wasn't expecting it to pore out, when I seen the pump type applicator so of course I gave it a quick few pumps and needless to say I had at least 2 applications now on my foundation brush.) don't be me lol pump slowly! As far as everything else it was a good foundation just needs a few adjustments. I can also say I do have truly sensitive skin and have found NO issues with breakouts using this product the past 4 days now! I have did some tweaking of my own and added a little of my primer with this particular foundation when applying it and have gotten the flaky look to disappear)(not saying this will work for everyone & my primer may be different that yours so just that that into consideration) Also all skin types are indeed different so just because it leaves me looking flaky doesn't mean it will you. But I hope this gives you a little insight on this particular product. As I said over all it turned out to be ok there was more positive than negative and if they fix the texture and the flaky on face look I'll give it another shot! But all in all I believe it's a innovative product.",
