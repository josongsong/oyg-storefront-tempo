        "comments": "This product is not worth the high price. It's a great concept but not executed well. It's a little heavy, and when I first opened the contour cap part it totally fell out before I could even try it, and it is disappointingly less than an inch long so wouldn't last long if it was intact. So that was a bummer. Also the blush does blend well but isn't very pigmented, so you can barely see it. Bummed about this purchase. Definitely would try a different brand than this one.",

I would highly recommend this if you are newer to makeup or do not have time to do a ton of makeup. I use it everyday and it is the easiest product to use. You just apply it to the skin and blend in. The color is shimmery so if you don't want shiny finish I would stick to the regular shades. The blush is a little peachy (which I love) and the contour is a nice chocolate color. It is easy to blend and build if you want a subtle or bold look. This is a staple for me and I am so glad they sell them in stores now!!",

The blush is the perfect pink-and I absolutely love the highlighter built into it. I am such a status stick girlie but i love that I can skip a step with highlighter and just do blush and glow all night. The contour shade perfectly compliments my skin tone and always blends seamlessly without any harsh lines-so important for a contour novice like me. I wore it to my birthday dinner last night and got SO many compliments on my skin and how glowy I was ! 10/10 product and shade-my duos usually last me so long-another thing I love about this stick-but I'll be so sad when it runs out!",

        "comments": "I love this product and how it looks on my face (as is the case for all the Dibs products I have tried). I especially love the glittery blush, and Courtney &amp; Jenna definitely did a great job of designing this. However (as is also the case for most Dibs products I've tried), the plastic casing is very cheap and falls apart VERY easily. Upon my first time using this product, the blush simply fell out of the plastic and I had to place it back in. This has also happened for the lip liners I have ordered from Dibs before, and my status sticks have also had issues with the plastic simply crumbling and breaking with seemingly no cause. Although I love the product itself, this shouldn't be happening at this price point. I will continue to buy from Dibs, but hopefully they can fix these issues with their packaging, as it has happened too many times to be a coincidence.",
