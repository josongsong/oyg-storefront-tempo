I loved the ease of use and effectiveness of your wipes for probably 10 years.  Recently, I noticed a filmy feel and blemishes popping up after use.  Then I saw 'new and improved' on the packaging.   The new formula does NOT leave skin feeling clean, feels filmy AND breaks me out which I assume is the addition of Aloe, which I am allergic to.  Please, please bring back the gentle formula for sensitive skin!",
