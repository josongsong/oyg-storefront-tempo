The cleanser itself feels really luxurious to use.  The foam feels soft and gentle on my skin, never irritates or dries my skin out.  You only need one pump.  I use it in the morning, and as a second step later in the day.  I have used it on it's own in the evening too, and it seemed to do a good job of removing makeup.  It's not strongly fragranced at all, which I appreciate.Love it!",

I recently tired a new cleanser and moisturizer for my night routine that really irritated my skin and made me break out, but this stuff got my skin back on track immediately! I gently massage one pump onto my face with my fingers after exfoliating with the BHA Hanskin Cleansing Oil using my silicone sonic cleaning device. This cleanser doesn't strip my skin and it pairs beautifully with their other products. So glad I gave this a try! Thanks to Hanskin I have beautiful, healthy looking, dewy glass skin!",

I use this cleanser mainly for my skin and to remove light makeup. I recently moved from a very humid climate to a more dry one, so I usually lean towards more oil-based cleansers. But since this product is so light, it doesn't dry out my skin nor hydrate it. The packaging is adorable yet, a bit too large for my personal taste. The one major con that stops me from using it again is the overbearing chemical smell.",

I never buy any product before thoroughly going through the ingredient list, which Ulta did not provide on the website. I took the risk anyway and bought it, which I do not regret because the ingredients are great! I make sure there's no harsh surfactants, pore clogging ingredients, and no fragrance/essential oils. This cleanser has none of those terrible ingredients, therefore perfect for sensitive skin! This does not remove makeup, so it's important to use a cleansing balm or oil beforehand. This cleanser can be used in the morning on a bare face as well. After use, your skin feels clean but not tight like most foaming cleansers. And even though this has many types of hyaluronic acid, your face does not feel like you put on a hydrating toner/lotion instead of actually cleansing your skin, which is a problem I had with the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser.  With that cleanser, you are left with a film on your face and your skin doesn't feel like it's been cleansed. With the Hanskin cleanser, you don't have that problem at all!",

        "comments": "I have very sensitive skin that's more on the dry side. I loveee using this product. I wanted a foam cleanser and found that this has a lower pH than other cleansers I've used. I've been using cetaphil for years but wanted to try something new. With my sensitive skin, I was afraid this would give me a reaction but it didn't. It worked really well with my skin and my skin felt really healthy but I know it's a combo of all the skin products that I also use to help out.  I didn't really notice the smell. It definitely did not bother me at all. One pump was enough to cover my whole face and wash thoroughly but I love the foam so I do 2 sometimes. \n\nOverall, I really do love this product. My face cleared up and it just felt really clean after washing it. It didn't feel too dry. The quality would be a 5. However, because of the pump, I'd have to rate it a 3. The pump kept getting stuck about every 10 pumps. When it did get stuck, I'd have to press down very fast and a lot to get the product out. Unless I just have a defective pump.....",
