  "details": "DetailsBenefitsRemoves dirt, oil, and makeupHydrates and soothes after cleansingAids in softening skin texture after consistent useEWG VERIFIEDKey IngredientsCoconut & Vitamin E: A composite blend of naturally derived surfactants from coconut and Vitamin E is infused into the formula. It serves as a gentle, deep cleanser leaving the skin soft to the touch and eliminating the tight, dry feeling typically experienced following the use of harsh surfactants.Strawberry Oil & Lycopene: These two ingredients play a role in the after-cleansing experience. Strawberry Oil gives the cleanser a refreshing, uplifting aroma, while Lycopene, a carotene derived from tomatoes, assists in fighting any free radical damage that could harm the skin throughout the day.Formulated WithoutSulfates: DIME [roducts never contain skin irritating ingredients such as sulfates. Sulfate-free products are gentle on the skin and can help decrease the chances of an allergic reaction.Parabens: Certain parabens have been linked to hormone disruption. DIME prohibits all parabens, including Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Isopropylparaben, Methylparaben, and Propylparaben.Phthalates: Certain phthalates (like Dibutyl Phthalate, aka DBP, or DEHP, and DEP) appear on product labels, but most typically remain unlisted, hiding under the term “fragrance.” Since some phthalates have been linked to hormone disruption, DIME avoids them.Item 2603230How To UseUse in the morning and at night as the first step in your skincare routine.

        "comments": "I've struggled with facial skin issues since 2015. I've seen 6 dermatologists and been diagnosed with rosacea, eczema, adult acne or a combination of those items. I've been prescribed topical creams including steroids and antibiotics and a 30 day round of doxycylene (an oral antibiotic). None of those items worked. I've tried nearly every product on the market for sensitive, rosacea and or eczema prone skin. Nothing worked, until I found Dime. I was tired of trying products and being disappointed in the results so I stopped trying for a while and kept seeing adds about Dime. Then my friends started recommending it so I caved and tried it. I AM SO GLAD I DID. My face hasn't looked or felt this good in 8 years and it took only days to start seeing results. I use the regimine pictured. Morning: Jelly Cleanser, Probiotic Gel, Lumosity Gel. Night: the same and I add the Restorative Cream. The Jelly Cleanser is super lightweight and feels calming on the skin. I love how easily it is to spread around and the slight foaming it has. It's also super effective at getting off all my makeup, the first time.",

        "comments": "Started using Dime products back in December of 2023 to help clear up cystic acne. I have tried both this product and their foam cleanser along with their serums and moisturizs. After about 7-8 months of consistent use I'm starting to see a difference but it hasnt stopped breakouts entirely. However, this company's customer service (Dime, not Ulta) is the overall reason for the 2 star review. I chatted with someone on their website for technical support and it was like texting with a snobby teenage girl who kept using \"like\" and passive aggressive comments - I was shocked at how unprofessional the conversation was. It was extremely off putting and has turned me away from wanting to continue use of their brand. Sounds silly, but if their team has a dont care attitude, it doesn't feel like something I want to support or continue use of.",
