I bought this bc I read tea tree can help with certain types of rosacea (high mite density) and I thought I would give it a shot. I was surprised to see my face immediately react positively to this. Also it's very moisturizing. I like to let it sit on my skin and dry completely before applying moisturizer and have actually forgotten my moisturizer a few times only to be left with soft moisturized skin. Can't wait to try other products from this line!",
