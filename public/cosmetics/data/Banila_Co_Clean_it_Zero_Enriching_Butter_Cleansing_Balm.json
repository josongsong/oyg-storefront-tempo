        "comments": "I like this cleanser but it doesn't seem very moisturizing. I use an oil based cleanser before bed because being able to apply to a dry face and use a soft damp cloth to remove is so much nicer than getting water everywhere. This works well to cleanse the daily sunscreen and creams off my face. However my face feels dry and stretched tight after using not moisturized at all. I like the Clean it Zero brand and will buy a different one in future to see if it adds moisture back better.",

This avocado one is okay but loses MAJOR points because of the way this product leaves a nasty heavy feeling of film coating your face as well as the  overpowering smell.  I held my breath, washed my face and my regular nightly skin routine....I STILL SMELL THE FLORAL SCENT.  😭😭😭  I also feel super greasy due to the fil/residue feeling left behind. \n\nI am gonna return this and get the Original Clean It Zero.",

It goes on the skin so smoothly and is so gently, yet somehow it's powerful enough to remove even the most stubborn makeup. Not only does it work well, but it's so nice to use before bed, especially here in New England where the weather is cold so the heat is on and my skin is SO dry! The scent is as soft and the balm is gentle, and the whole experience of using this feels like a treat! It also comes with a great little spatula to easily apply it to the skin. For the days my skin feels extra dry, I leave it on for a little longer and it works as a mask, which really helps my skin feel better especially on these winter days! In fact, I have this balm on my skin as I type this review. I really love it! I received this product in exchange for review (but it will now be a staple in my nightly routine)",

From the moment I opened the jar, I was impressed by the luxurious, buttery texture that glides effortlessly onto the skin. It melts away every trace of makeup, sunscreen, and impurities without the need for harsh rubbing, leaving my face feeling clean and refreshed.\n\nWhat truly sets this product apart is how nourishing it is. Unlike many other cleansers that leave my skin feeling tight or dry, this balm maintains my skin's natural moisture balance, even in the colder months. It's perfect for my dry-to-combination skin, ensuring a thorough cleanse without compromising hydration. My skin feels soft, plump, and soothed after every use.\n\nThe light, pleasant fragrance is a bonus, adding a spa-like touch to my nightly routine.

It really did a great job of capturing all the gunk, grime and makeup without striping my skin in the process. I wiped off my T-zone with a damp cloth and left the rest on overnight.\n\nSecond, I used it as a mask for about 25 minutes. I wiped the excess off with a damp cloth and seriously, my skin was SO soft and hydrated after. I noticed a huge difference under my eyes and on my cheekbones. It was still so soft the next morning!\n\nThe ONLY \"issue\" I have is the fragrance, I wish it were unscented as a lot of scents trigger migraines for me. While I don't love the fragrance, I can tolerate it because the product itself is so nice. If they had a fragrance free option, that would be a game changer!\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this balm as cold weather is approaching to keep that hydrated glow all year!",

        "comments": "Let me start off by saying the Original Clean It Zero is the best.  This avocado one is okay but loses MAJOR points because of the way this product leaves a nasty heavy feeling of film coating your face as well as the  overpowering smell.  I held my breath, washed my face and my regular nightly skin routine....I STILL SMELL THE FLORAL SCENT.  😭😭😭  I also feel super greasy due to the fil/residue feeling left behind. \n\nI am gonna return this and get the Original Clean It Zero.",
