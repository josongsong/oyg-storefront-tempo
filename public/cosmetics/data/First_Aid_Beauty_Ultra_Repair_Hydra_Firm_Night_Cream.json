I love how soft it leaves my skin feeling in the morning, and doesn't irritate my skin or make my acne worse. Also doesn't enlarge my pores which is a bonus! I actually tried out this product for the first time a year ago, once I ran out I ended up trying another night cream which was just OK, and returned back to this product -- I don't think I'll ever try another night cream again, this is the winner!",

I saw this and thought it would be perfect since Ive heard great reviews on the basic ultra repair cream, and this night cream even has a scale with a cactus on it meaning it is good for very dry skin. Ive been using it for over a month now and honestly, my forehead has only gotten drier. It is super flaky and rough, and I put on a decent amount of this night cream, but I still wake up every morning with dry skin. Im going to finish the container since it is expensive and it does come with a lot of product, but it definitely is not for dry skin like it advertises.",

A little goes a looong way so the price is justifiable to me, though it is more than I imagined spending on a moisturizer. I also love that it doesn't have a scent to it.",

I was pretty skeptical that any moisturizer would work with my skin rather than making me break out in pimples and oil slicks - I'm glad tried this anyway. I've been using it for three months and my skin has never looked better. I use the cleanser first, then follow it with this moisturizer and my skin looks good and feels good. My blemishes are pretty much gone and my skin isn't dry anymore, and the oiliness has gone down significantly. I highly recommend this stuff (and really, really hope that FAB never stops making their products).",

I thought this initial reaction might subside, so I tried to keep the moisturizer on my face for a little bit. After 5 minutes, my face was starting to develop hives. I immediately scrubbed my face and returned to my normal moisturizer. I am so disappointed- I love the Ultra Repair Cream so much and I thought this would be an extension of that. Sadly can't use this product. I am surprised because FAB's skincare is normally very gentle and formulated with clean ingredients- I don't know why I reacted so poorly to this product :(",
