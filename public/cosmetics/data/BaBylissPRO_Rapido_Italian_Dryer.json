        "comments": "When my old T3 dryer broke recently, I began the hunt for a new one. I didn't want anything over the top, just something that worked well and would be dependable for the next 10 or so years (that's how long I had my T3). I tried a couple other brands and ended up returning them for various reasons. Then I found BaByliss and the price point as well as the reputation of the brand seemed right. I love that this dryer has varying speed and heat settings (one of the other dryers I tried had just one HOT heat setting). I have a lot of hair that typically takes a while to dry, and I DO feel that this dryer dries my hair more quickly than anything else I've had in the past. I like that it came with the 2 attachment nozzles (and that it had the option to buy a diffuser attachment separately, which I did). It really is so lightweight and a breeze to use. I'm glad I tried it in store against the Portofino, because this one is significantly quieter and had a much softer hum, which I can only assume is from the brushless motor. I haven't had any issues with the controls being on the handle like others have mentioned, but I could see how to placement might not work for some. The one reason that I did not give this 5 stars is because I don't feel that it makes my hair look totally silky smooth like my T3 did. It has the True Ion generator, so I figured it would give me the same sleek results as my T3, but I am seeing more fly aways popping up with this dryer, and I don't feel that it leaves my hair looking as smooth or hydrated as my T3. But alas, you can't have it all, and this is a really great dryer.",

My hair has lasted feeling clean and beautiful for 3 days now with a little bit of dry shampoo (which doesn't happen when I don't blow dry). The Rapido also gave me a lot of volume making my hair feel light. The heat on this dryer is amazing!!! It gets really hot for my thick straight hair (perfect for blowouts). The air is not as powerful than the BaByliss Nano dryer but when I need heat, I'll grab this Rapido dryer.",

The heat on it recently started working intermittently…so I was wanting to replace it (with the same one). Then I seen this one went onsale but was cautious because of reviews saying the blower would quit in a couple weeks. I decided to give it a try anyway because I could return it and grab the Porofino dryer if that happened. Let me tell you, I have had this dryer a few weeks now and it has made a HUGE difference! I have curly poofy humidty horrible head of hair. I have to flat iron anytime I blow dry because of how frizzy/poofy it is. After drying with this dryer…I can go out without flat ironing!!!! Never ever could I have before!!! Its truly amazing!!! Even in this florida heat/humidity my hair stays mostly frizz/poof free!!!! I would not have believed it had I not experienced it for myself!! I am SO impressed and it was SO worth the money!!! Total game changer for me!",

        "comments": "I was looking for a new hair dryer and wanted one with a lot of power that had variable settings, a diffuser, and wasn't too loud. I looked at various models and decided to give this a shot. I forget if it has 2000 watts or more than 2000 but either way, most dryers have between 1375 and 1875 watts and wow, does the additional wattage make a difference! My hair dries so much faster now - I can almost hit the snooze bar one more time and still not be late for work!\n\nIn addition to the power, it comes not only with one diffuser but three, all different sizes. Two are angled, which is great for when you're using a rounded brush - it goes right along the brush contours. Ok maybe these are technically diffusers - they concentrate the air flow rather than diffuse it - so hopefully you know what I mean when I'm referring to these attachments.\n\nTwo speeds, three heat settings with a button for \"cold air blast.\" The high heat setting takes a little time to get to full heat, but when it is at full heat it gets very hot so be careful. I only use that setting when I first start drying my hair to get excess water out and then turn down to medium heat. The intensity of the highest heat setting is my only complaint - but it doesn't stop me from getting what I need from the dryer.\n\nIt is also a little bit quieter than my prior (lower wattage) hair dryer and was definitely quieter than other higher power hair dryers I tested at Ulta.\n\nNote that while this hair dryer is pretty expensive, I used a 20% coupon and my points (I save my points toward a splurge) and ended up getting this for under $23. But now that I've used it a few times, while I would not want to pay full price for this, I definitely think it is worth investing in this dryer if you have at least the 20% off coupon.",

For this reason I honestly don't know if I'd buy another Babyliss dryer again.",
