I'm not expecting a miracle, but I expected some volume. The stylist used it at my hair appointment because she felt maybe I was doing soemthing wrong… I still did not like it.

I Create Volume has the perfect balance between hold and volume - I don't like a lot of crunch to my curls, so it's perfect. It's more of a curling jelly, but leaves my hair soft and bouncy (I see why it was sold out for so long). My hair has never lasted for more than 1 day only using 2 products until I tried Innersense. I also noticed that my Day 1 curls are on point and get better throughout the week (I refresh on Day 5 and have wash day on Day 7). With other products, usually my Day 2 &amp; 3 curls are best). I followed the steps from my hairdresser and still in shock. These products LOVE water, so my stylist showed me how to properly emulsify the products to proper add to my hair (and you save product!). I have been natural for about 5-6 years now and my friends and family have noticed a difference in my hair. I have Type 3C/4A hair, low porosity, and fine hair density. I have tried almost every popular curly hair product and Innersense wins easily. If you know how to apply the products properly, it's a smart investment. I have had my products for almost 3 months now and I still have more than half the bottle from the Hairbath and Daily Conditioner (regular size). I ordered the max. size of I Create Volume because it's popular and I can tell it will most likely last the year.",

It creates beautiful curls and really nice volume on day one and 2, but I ran out Of my trial size and while I was waiting for my order of the larger size to come in I realized that using different products I was able to get better results on the third and fourth day. If you like to wash your hair every other day or even every day and this is a great product but after two days my hair starts to look dull and dirty and it starts to feel dry and crispy. I don't get that same result with other curl activator's or curl creams so I think I am going to ditch this which is a bummer because I have almost an entire brand new large bottle of it. It does smell really nice. It's a very light scent and doesn't give me a headache.",
