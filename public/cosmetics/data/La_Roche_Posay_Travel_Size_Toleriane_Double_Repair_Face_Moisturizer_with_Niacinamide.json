        "comments": "I was a little hesitant to try this moisturizer because I'd seen a lot of negative reviews, but my skin drinks it up like water in the desert. I have combination to dry, sensitive skin, and this is one of the few moisturizers that actually leaves my skin feeling truly satisfied once it absorbs. It keeps my skin hydrated without feeling greasy or heavy and leaves a smooth, glowy finish that lasts throughout the day\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for me has been finding a moisturizer that works under my mineral sunscreen. Even with products that should be compatible, like a water-based sunscreen over a water-based moisturizer, my SPF still flakes or pills no matter how long I wait before applying it. With this one, I usually wait just 5-10 minutes and my sunscreen glides on perfectly, stays in place all day, and doesn't disturb the moisturizer underneath. This has made it a staple in my morning routine.\n\nIt's fragrance-free, but it also doesn't have that odd \"fragrance-free\" smell, which I really appreciate. The texture is lightweight yet nourishing, and it doesn't irritate my skin or clog my pores. I've never had breakouts from it. I'm already on my third bottle, which says a lot because I usually rotate through products pretty quickly.",

After getting out of the shower, applying toner, and serum, I applied the moisturizer. My eyes started watering and I thought it could have been that my eyes were dry. I did the same routine the very next day before work. By the time I had gotten to work, my eyes watering, tears down my face, burning, nose running, and sneezing. Throughout the day, my coworkers kept asking me if I was okay because my eyes were THAT SWOLLEN. I tried eye drops multiple times to wash out my eyes, it did not work. I went to the bathroom and finally decided to wash my face with water. I got some relief but, nothing really made my symptoms go away until I completely washed my face and took a benedryl. I recommend skipping this product entirely and going with Clinique moisture surge or a Pur moisturizer!!!",

For the price point there is a good amount of product and lasts you months so youre really getting your moneys worth. Keep in mind a little goes a long way with thus product. I pair it with the face wash and let me tell you, the discourlation that Ive had for years is beginning to fade and my skin is BRIGHT!!! Highly recommend this brand/product.",

I have had a drastic change with how my skin looks. It looks hydrated. It looks healthy and more importantly it doesn't look dull anymore. I have eczema and very sensitive skin. For years I have struggled with finding a good moisturizing product for my face and most of the time I would just put vaseline or aquaphor on my face because everything else broke me out. One of my friends suggested for me to try this product and at first I was very hesitant because I was tired of wasting money on products I couldn't use and I didn't want to deal with another flare. I started using this product about 10 months ago and I probably will never go to anything else. I suggest you to try out a small bottle because I do realize that what works for one may not work for another but hopefully you will find some relief with using this product.",

I sell make-up for a living and my company even has a skincare line but it just wasn't for me and my skin. so I have tried hundreds of different products and La Roche-Posay is hands down my favorite 😍! I will be telling all my friends about these products and I have a lot of friends! I also have a rare terminal auto immune disease called Scleroderma and its hard to find products that don't irritate my skin but these products don't. I feel light and airy not to creamy or oily. I also have combination skin and it works for it like a charm. I highly recommend if your thinking about trying these products to just go ahead and get them! you won't be disappointed!",
