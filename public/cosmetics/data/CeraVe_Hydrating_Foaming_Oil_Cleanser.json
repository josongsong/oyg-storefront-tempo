        "comments": "I have been trying to replace my beloved, discontinued Eucerin Skin Calming Body Wash (a soybean oil based oil cleanser), and this is one of the many products I have tried. This is not an oil cleanser. It does not have an oily consistency, but something like a thin gel consistency. Skinfix has something similar (although a lot more expensive). So does Naturium. \nThis cleanser is VERY stripping and drying and dehydrating if you are used to a true oil cleanser. \nSo disappointed in Cerave (and so many other brands) for calling a stripping gel cleanser an oil cleanser.\nI will say, this isn't a bad product if you are looking for a normal gel cleanser. For someone with sensitive, easily stripped, dehydrated skin, this is highly disappointing and not what was advertised.",

Looking for a more economical option, I tried this, but was disappointed. \"Foaming\" should have tipped me off that there is a surfactant (soap) in this, but I didn't make the connection right away. My skin wasn't a disaster after using this, but it was dryer and tighter than I like and didn't feel very clean; my skin looked dull and kind of filmy as well. I'll be returning it.",

        "comments": "I personally really like this cleanser, and it seems to work really well on my acne prone oily/combo skin. Some people in other reviews have complained it's not a true oil cleanser. While I do agree that it's more water based and not a full on oil, it is much more gentle on the skin than other foaming face washes because it does have some oil in it. It's almost like an oily soap? I like this because I think an actual oil cleanser would break me out. My face gets so dry in the winter to the point I am unable to use my acne wash (Panoxyl and La Roshe) as often, so I started using this and it's helped with my dryness so much and didn't cause me to breakout more. I break out very very easily too. If you have combo skin this is perfect for maintaining hydration on dry spots and getting rid of excess oil on oiler spots.",

I gave it an extra star because the scent is inoffensive and it seemed to clean well, but I won't repurchase. Back to my trusty Vanicream.",

I first used it to wash the makeup off my face and I have to say, it did a good job dissolving and removing it.  As I usually do a double wash, I wet my face again, applied another pea sized amount of cleanser and immediately noticed that my face did not feel in any way stretched or tight, even though I washed it twice.  My skin actually remained supple and soft.  After using it just a few nights and mornings, I am in awe at how gently and effectively it cleans my skin without drying it out and how healthy looking it looks after.  I have used this at the sink and also taken it into the shower with me as it does need water to use it properly.  It is quite a nice product and one I will definitely use the whole bottle and rebuy!  I appreciate that this cleanser is residue free keeping all those harmful ingredients that damage my skin away and uses ingredients that will be a benefit to healthy skin.  My sister who has acne prone skin was also very impressed with how calming and gentle this was on her skin and how healthy her skin looks after using it.  It did not cause either of us redness or inflammation...this really is a good product and developed with Dermatologists!",

        "comments": "I love Cerave as a brand and I was excited to try out a new oil cleanser. Fragrance-Free is always what I look for in skin care. I do a two-step cleansing process and use oil cleansers as the first step. This cleanser is good at getting off all of my makeup and sunscreen. The downside for me is that it is too stripping and it really dried out my skin. My skin is so sensitive and dry. It did mostly pass the sensitive skin test. I didn't have any redness or irritation, other than it did sting when I got it into my eye. I have other oil cleansers that I use that don't sting at all and I would prefer to be able to use my oil cleanser on my eyes. Unfortunately, it was just too intense for my skin and I had to tap out after 5 days. I will keep it as a backup for my regular products but I won't be able to use it every day. If you have regular or oily skin, I would definitely try it out.",
