But sadly I can't return this item anymore… Anyway, this \"lip repair\" stick is an awful product which dries your lips out instantly, and makes you feel like you have to almost instantly reapply a second coat after your fresh coat. The taste is of pure sunblock, I knew this product had SPF but I was thinking it was going to have an actually bearable taste, this just feels like you're chugging a bottle of sunscreen. Would NOT recommend this, just stick with a classic chapstick, or carmex tube instead of this, at least THOSE will somewhat do their job.",
