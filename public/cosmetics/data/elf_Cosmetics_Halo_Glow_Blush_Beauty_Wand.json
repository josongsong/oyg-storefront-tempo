I ordered candlelit and I've seen people say it is a \"blush topper,\" not for me. It honestly made me feel like I picked the wrong shade but this is a really nice, soft, peachy shade and with a beautiful champagne sparkle. Perfect color for spring. Before I put translucent powder on it was pretty but the translucent powder over it gave it the most beautiful, soft glow. From my experience with the highlighter it can go over powders without issue. So if you did want to use this as a topper I'm sure you could. It kind of blended in with the highlighter a little bit to the point where it was almost hard to tell the difference between the highlight and the blush which might be a good thing. I had no problems with the blush, highlighter or contour blending together. It's not patchy at all and is seamless.\n\nMy only problem with this product are those sponge tip applicators. I just think they're gross so I ripped it off.",

I knew from watching others use these blush wands that you had to blend super quick so I was ready. I applied two dots and before I could even pick up my brush the product had completely dried and set in dots on my face. No matter what I did I could not get those dots to go away and I tried everything. I had no choice but to take off all my makeup and start again. I have tried twice since then to try to get this product to work for me but the dry time is immediate. Maybe I got a bad batch. I'm not sure. I reached out to customer service but they were not interested in helping. So disappointed! This is the worse Elf product I have ever used.",
