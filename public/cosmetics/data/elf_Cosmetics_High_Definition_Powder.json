        "comments": "I was almost out of the elf soft luminescence HD powder and decided to try the halo glow loose powder instead as my replacement. Oh HECK NO. I actually ended up accidentally placing 2 of the halo glow powders in my cart (one pink and the other in light) and will be returning both promptly. They are not even CLOSE to the quality of the HD powder and I honestly hate  them in comparison LOL. \nHD powder: although I do notice a few random specks of glitter here and there, it looks more like the specks transferred to my face by accident from something unrelated vs \"I applied glitter makeup to my face\". Otherwise, it offers a pearly sheen that looks heavenly radiant. This powder is super finely milled and leaves a velvety soft, silky finish to skin. I've never gotten flashback with the soft lumi color, just a nice, soft, diffused, airbrushed-looking finish. Not drying or cakey to my dry, mature (42 yo) skin. \nIn comparison to the halo glow - the Halo Glow loose powder is much more shimmery (almost frosted) and it exaggerated the heck out of any texture on my skin. It also has an almost clumpy/cakey looking texture and left a gummy (???) residue on my skin that felt tacky and seemed to leave me looking at least 14 yrs older. I tried both the pink and light colors with multiple combinations of sunscreens/moisturizers/primers with the same unpleasant results. I cannot get it to work for me. Will be exchanging for the HD immediately!",

        "comments": "I had never used elf products before, but I'd been looking for a cheap alternative to some things I wanted to try and add to my makeup routine. This HD powder is beautiful, if you know how to use it right. Yes, it's loose and powdery, so be careful not to tip the container upside down, even closed, or else when you open it there will be a mess. I'd also avoid using the puff it comes with to apply the product, use a complete coverage brush (but keep the puff thing in the box because it helps the powder stay in and not fly everywhere when you open it) It doesn't smell, I have combo/sensitive skin that it didn't bother, and it takes a little getting used to applying it.\n\nIt doesn't magically hide all flaws, but I noticed a definite softness to my features, and in pictures I look amazing\n\n Also, don't overuse and abuse! I saw a lot of reviews complaining they got a chalky effect, and I did too, after I applied a little too much. Less is more with this product, and trying to focus on the spots you want to soften is a better idea than going for all-over (For me, that's smile-lines, eye lines, and pores).\n\nI have fair skin, so I got the white one, I really love the effect, but for people with darker skin tones, I'd suggest going with the darker colors or risk looking chalky.\n\nOverall I recommend this product, and I was super impressed, especially with the price difference, compared to other things on the market.\n\nAlso works great to set lipstick (using a tissue between your lips and the powder).\n\nI've added a picture, sans any other makeup but the HD powder. The left side of my face has it applied, the right doesn't. I can definitely see a softening of my features, and an evening of my blotchy skin tone. Especially under and around my eyes! So ladies, decide for yourselves ;)",

Any type of harsh lighting or camera flash will give you a white cast where ever you apply it. Specially if you use it over foundation. Also, the thin formula would be great if it didn't create such a mess. You loose too much powder even by opening it. If you have a medium to dark skin tone this will look a little unnatural. You can see the product in the surface instead of being more blendable.",
