I'm a pale, olive skinned girly, and it has literally been impossible for me to find anything that matches my skin. This is the first foundation that I've worn that matches my skin and my undertone perfectly. It's really easy to work with and last all day. Light to medium coverage, but definitely buildable with a really nice skin like finish. I am so happy with it. If I could change one thing, I just wish that they would change the packaging to a pump instead of a dough foot applicator.",

(For reference: I have combo skin and use One/Size's Secure the Wweat primer.) This foundation feels like I have nothing on but looks skin-like with a beautiful soft matte finish. (A little goes a long way!) Very comparable to the Lumi Matte foundation (which I also love), but this one does a better job at keeping natural oils at bay IMO. (Lumi Matte ends up a little too glowy on me after a few hours, so I need to keep blotting papers on hand.) Because there are so many undertones in this line, it's best to swatch in store. The only con is the packaging. I wish it were a pump bottle. The doe foot is quite large and awkwardly shaped, so it's a pain getting it in and out of the bottle.  Would also love if the brand launched mini versions of a few shades for travel!",

I was excited to find an olive tone foundation to try but I wore this to the office one day and any time I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror I couldnt help but think this looked OFF— I looked tired and skin looked like it was dehydrated AND oily.  It looked almost greasy and dry at the same time and left my face looking like i had texture that I dont actually have.  Super strange! It also oxidized and had a washed out appearance on my skin but didnt cover very well at the same time.  The applicator also seemed to really want to work against me and applied such little amounts of foundation, I could barely build it up. I'm going to see if I can return soon and just get my my usuals. I don't recommend this unfortunately.",

        "comments": "As someone personally, who does love a more natural make up look for day-to-day, I find that this foundation doesn't absolutely perfect. You can build it up to a more medium coverage however I do a more sheared to light coverage due to the fact that it does cover pretty well. I do feel like you do need a powder in some places. You definitely do need a primer if you are going to be wearing this out for a long period of time. This does have a radiant finish or dewy finish, i personally enjoy that. This is dry, skin friendly, I do recommend exfoliating, though just beforehand just in case. I love that you can mix other products and that it is compatible with other products that I do use on my face. but I really need to apply the shade range because it really does adhere to everyone with all different undertones. I had been in the biggest ruckus about finding a foundation that matched me perfectly. And the fact that I was able to find one after multiple brands were not able to find my exact shade, it really made me happy and I was very satisfied. I enjoy that they also had warm, but also they had an olive undertone which I feel like is always mixed into warm, and I don't like that. However, with this brand they did not do that and they really made sure that people with all of undertones were seen.\nMy only complaint is that I do wish this was a pump instead of a double foot applicator. I just personally enjoy the pump because it's just is something of a preference for me however, it does not bother me that bad where it would discourage me from purchasing the product again. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to my friends and I do recommend this to my friends. I feel like this is a foundation that is slept on. It almost irritates me overall I love the foundation. I will definitely be purchasing this again.",

I had to go to ulta a few times because the shades I picked out either ran too yellow too red or just flat out was orange after letting it oxidize. I think this shade range is a start but truly alot of the colors were too orange and just yellowish. The only pros are the ones that people already mentioned before its a nice satin finish lightweight buildable yes that is true. I didnt feel like i had loads of makeup on my face when i applied it 3 times it felt like a moisturizer with a nice glow. The cons I just think the smell was a bit interesting like it wasnt a horrible smell but its not like a pleasant one either idk you might have to just buy it to understand and see for yourself. The applicator was tough to get out i thought i would get foundation everywhrre with the way I was struggling to pull put the wand from the bottle. I think the wand is very cool but maybe the issue with the packging is just the firmness the bottle has to the wand.",
