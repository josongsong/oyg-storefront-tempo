My hair is in very good condition  I wanted to go to only ising a leave in conditioner when drying and a light styling productwith heat protection. I used this the first time and it was good. No issues. I used it the next day, following the same process: no over spaying, let it dry, I combed it through hair when I sprayed it and when it was dry. I did my first curl with the curling iron, and everything on that iron immediately burned ,stuck to the iron and came off. HUGE chunk of hair gone! Right around my face. There was no wet spot, nothing should have caused this. I have never had this happen to me. I searched reviews,  and I am not the first to experience this. Stay away if you like your hair. So mad!!!",

I was just using it way WRONG!!! The key is to spray, and start brushing right away to blend in. Let dry a little bit, and then start curling or styling. I have never gotten such a perfect clean release from my curling iron, and it adds shine and incredible hold. You dont even have to spray the curl again after release or use a finishing spray. This is a hairspray and heat protecant so I think some of the bad reviews are due to user error like my first time trying it. I will never stop repurchasing this. It lasts me a long time for how often I curl my hair so I think the price point is great. I feel like this gets most of the credit on keeping my curls for days. I never used to be able to get a curl to hold no matter what I did, but right when I started using this spray I have curls for days. Give it a try! I know its sticky at first, but brush out and trust the process and it turns out perfect.",

This stuff is super sticky/tacky upon spraying which I thought wouldn't be an issue after styling- I was wrong. After styling, my hair was dry and crunchy which resulted in sooooo many tangles. I have thick hair that usually doesn't tangle easily so this was super frustrating. I would run my fingers through my hair every 5 minutes and find a ton of new tangles when all I was doing was sitting at the dinner table talking to friends. And lastly, I didn't feel that it held my curls any better than normal hairspray.",

Using this product on dry hair before using a curling iron, Calista, makes it possible for my hair to curl enough to hold a body wave.   I also sometimes apply it to my hair wet or dry hair without using a curling iron to give lift and body to my hair.  The best feature I love about many many Kendra products is that the scent is light and not obnoxiously smelling.  I am sensitive to many scented products and can't use them without getting a stomachache.  This product's light scent doesn't bother me.",

This product turned me onto Kenra and I've used several other products which I've been very happy with including the Platinum blow dry spray and especially the platinum silkening mist.  Going to try the hairspray next.",
