The glycolic acid exfoliator I was using just was not giving the results I would like so I wanted to try something new and this was something in a decent price range that would not break the bank. The bottle says for use twice a day, but I really don't recommend that unless you have super oily skin otherwise you will compromise your skin barrier. It did sting a bit after I put it on, but that usually happens with all acids I use. It went away in about 2 minutes or less, I used azelaic acid to target some acne spots I had, added moisturizer, and went to bed. Woke up to nice, bright skin. Did not break me out more. For reference I am 30, with acne-prone normal to dry skin now that I am getting older.",

        "comments": "BYOMA is here with neon-coloured skin care saviours designed with 'no fillers, no fluff'. Gentle enough for daily use, this brightening facial toner works to clear pores and control oiliness for softer, smoother skin and a more radiant complexion.\n\n  The Brightening Toner is the first product I've tried from Byoma and I was surprised at how great of a product it is! I love the fun neon orange color and shape of the bottle - really easy to spot on my counter. I love that the bottle tells you exactly when and how to use this product. This toner should only be used at night. It says on the bottle to pour it on my hands and pat on my face, but I pour it on a cotton round and swipe it around my face and that works really well. It has a medium density and is easy to spread on the face. It's amazing how much excess oil/dirt the toner removes that the face wash didn't get. There was no burning from the lactic acid like I've had with products before.\n\n  I have only been using this product for a short period of time and I can already tell a difference with my skin. I have combination skin and this does a great job of balancing it. My skin and face feel so hydrated after using it and not only does it clean, it also gently exfoliate, brightens my complexion, re-hydrates, smooths skin, helps restore compromised skin barrier, tones so you don't stay oily, and my pores have decreased. It's definitely putting youth back in to my face and neck! It doesn't leave my skin feeling dry or irritated, or a weird texture or tackiness at all. \n\n  Con: When I first went to apply the toner, it poured out. I don't like how large the opening is. It should come with an applicator or smaller opening. Otherwise it is easy to use. \n\n  A beauty essential that penetrates deep into the pores and results in a more radiant complexion, is a product that I can get behind! This multi-purpose product is the only one you need because of how many benefits come with it!",

        "comments": "The Byoma Brightening toner comes in a peachy orange 150 ml container with a twist off lid. There is initially a small aluminum cap over the opening that needs to be pulled off so it doesn't spill. The lid does a good job keeping the toner in without the covering if it is tipped over. I used the toner on clean skin after washing my face at bedtime. I put it on a cotton pad to rub/pat over my face and neck. I did not need to use very much to get everything and it did have a tiny sting to it but my skin is very dry right now so that could be the reason. I do think my skin feels nice after applying but I haven't noticed my skin tone/texture changing.",
