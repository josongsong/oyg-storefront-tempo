I have very sensitive skin and this is the only one that doesn't make my eyes water and itch. It goes on smoothly, lasts all day, and comes off easily with eye makeup remover.\n\nOver time, I have tried most of the shades, but my favorite, by far, was Color 12 MOSS. It was a wonderful shade of green, not too dark or too bright. It really made my green eyes pop! I was very disappointed when it was discontinued. (Why was it?) I haven't been able to find another shade like it, that I can wear.\n\nAlthough I will continue to use the other colors, I really miss MOSS! Please bring MOSS back!",

Now, within the past year or so, it will break off with very little pressure, sometimes before you hardly get it to your eye, and you end up with hardly any product left after a very short period of time. These liners being sold are either old and have been on the shelf a long time, the formula is drying out or changing in transit, or the formula has just completely changed. I know how to use it and have had absolutely no problems for many many years. I noticed some added \"how to use\" advice on here that I've never seen before, so my speculation is I am not the only one that has had this issue and rather than fix the problem, the blame is being put on the consumer and how they use it. That is just NOT the case. I used this for too long with no problems. CLINIQUE, PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM. This has always been my main eyeliner for years and would really like to continue using it.",
