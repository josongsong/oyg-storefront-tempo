From the very first use, I noticed how easily it lifts the roots and adds instant volume without making my hair feel stiff or crunchy. The lightweight formula gives my hair a natural fullness that lasts throughout the day, yet it still feels soft and touchable. What I love most is how it works even on fine hair like mine — it gives structure and body without weighing strands down. It also has that signature Moroccanoil scent, which makes styling feel like a little luxury experience every time I use it. The spray bottle is convenient and precise, allowing me to target the roots directly for maximum lift. A little goes a long way, so even the 75ml size is practical for travel and long-lasting in daily use. Overall, this product delivers exactly what I want in a root booster: reliable volume, lightweight hold, and a polished finish.",

While I do love this product and want to incorporate it to my daily routine, it can be tough perfecting this without my hair feeling \"hair\" especially since my hair is thin. I will say that a little (emphasis on little) goes a long way and make sure to spray a few generous inches away from your head. This is a good product but would reach the perfect scale if they can find a way to volumize without leaving my hair hard.",
