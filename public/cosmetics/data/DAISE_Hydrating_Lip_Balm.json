The coconut scent smeels nothing like coconut its just a weird smell. It takes forever to get product on your lip. Literally sit there swiping it on my lip over and over and nothing. Spend the extra dollar or 2 and skip this product.",

        "comments": "The Hydrating Lip Balm in Watermelon has a fun, fruity scent that's very reminiscent of bubblegum watermelon—sweet and playful, though it leans a bit artificial. It's a nice burst of fragrance, but there's a noticeable undertone of wax that can take away from the overall experience.\n\nThe packaging is shiny plastic and feels a bit on the cheap side—light and flimsy, which makes it feel less premium than some other lip balms. The balm itself is shaped like an egg, similar to EOS, which is cute but not the most practical if you're looking for precision.\n\nIn terms of texture, it's definitely on the oilier side, leaving a slick layer on the lips. It feels smooth and hydrating initially, but it doesn't seem to do much for rehydrating dry lips. Instead, it just creates a barrier to prevent further dryness—like an oil layer that sits on top rather than sinking in.\n\nAs for longevity, the balm doesn't last too long. It tends to wear off quickly because of the slick, greasy feeling, so you'll likely need to reapply every couple of hours.\n\nOverall, this lip balm is nice for a quick moisture fix and a fun scent, but it doesn't provide lasting hydration or a substantial treatment for dry lips. It's more of a lightweight, temporary solution.",

        "comments": "The initial packaging was a little frustrating to open because there was not a clear way to get the cardboard and plastic off without cutting it open and the scent of the balm was very strong. The second I cut through the packaging I could already smell the coconut and that was before I even had the packaging completely off or the cap twisted off. The scent had a slight sunscreeny smell to it which I was a bit put off by and the taste of it was horrendous. I wasn't trying to taste it, but a product that you put on your lips is bound to get on your tongue at some point and even a tiny bit of the product in my mouth was awful. It had a bitter, chemical taste and left my tongue feeling very weird. The balm itself was also very thick and waxy which some people may prefer, but I prefer a smoother balm, and the shape of the balm (almost an egg shape) was also a little awkward to use to put on my lips. I am not going to use the rest of this product because of the awful chemical taste and I don't feel safe using it if it tastes that bad and is on my lips where it's bound to get in my mouth. I really did not like this product at all.",
