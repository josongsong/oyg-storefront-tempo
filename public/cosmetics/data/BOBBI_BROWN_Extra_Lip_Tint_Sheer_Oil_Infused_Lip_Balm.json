I am heartbroken because otherwise the texture and longevity and moisturizing effect are all wonderful for a tinted balm - my parched lips need a thicker, lasting product, but prefer it not to be sticky, and this nails it without any obnoxious smell or taste…but oof I can't handle that stupid pink color change!!!",

It is the perfect balmy texture on the lips meaning it is not sticky, not slippery, and not drying to the lips like some lip balms are to the lips. The color to me is an added bonus. I'd buy it if it had no color. A lip balm should hydrate, plump, and feel comfortable on the lips - this does all 3 for me. My favorite color is bare pink. You can wear it alone or on it's own. My FAVORITE way to wear it is applied to the lips before I put on my makeup. Then, after I am done with my makeup, I apply my favorite lipstick over the top of it. This product perfectly hydrates the lips under lipstick. Thank you Bobbi Brown for making the perfect skin care and makeup product in one. Please don't ever stop making the Extra Lip Tint.",

        "comments": "I am SO disappointed I didn't dig farther into reviews or ingredients on these balms - they contain the color changing or \"pH adjusting\" dye (red 27 is listed in the ingredients). So no matter what color you choose, you'll end up with a raspberry pink lip stain. I am heartbroken because otherwise the texture and longevity and moisturizing effect are all wonderful for a tinted balm - my parched lips need a thicker, lasting product, but prefer it not to be sticky, and this nails it without any obnoxious smell or taste…but oof I can't handle that stupid pink color change!!!",
