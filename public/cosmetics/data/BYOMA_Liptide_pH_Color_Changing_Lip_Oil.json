When I got it I thought it was so pretty and I was in loveee...until I left it sideways on my nightstand and it leaked EVERYWHERE. also I use it when I have dry lips, and dead skin flakes just get stuck and go back into the tube. It's just a sticky mess all over and the consistency is sometimes amazing and slay and chefs kiss.. other times it's gross and flakey. It also kinda made my lips dryer. Look, Byoma, I know you want to make your products big and clunky and cute for a younger audience, but PLEASE work on your packaging so I can actually use all of the product. I totally recommend this product if you don't have a problem with leakage and stickiness, But I'll be finishing the rest of mine and probably not repurchasing until the packaging and formula get an upgrade.",

You are not reinventing the lip oil wheel here.\n\nAs for the formula, its fine. Light texture, smells nice enough, but I did not notice any major hydration or softness beyond the first 10 to 15 minutes. After that my lips were like, did we even put anything on\n\nBut the real offender here is the packaging. Why do I need upper body strength and a prayer to get the wand out Every time I open it I feel like I need protective goggles in case the thing snaps back at me. It is giving beauty product meets resistance band.\n\nIf the packaging gets fixed and the formula steps up its hydration game maybe I would bump this to a 3.5 star. For now it is a cute idea but not worth the effort literally.",

Problem is i bought this a Ulta and when i opened it the applicator broke and fell off into the lipgloss. Luckily the Ulta employees let me switch it out for a new one. Another problem is if you leave it laying down it leaks out i always have to keep it straight up not helpful if you want it in a bag. But definitely worth the price",

My prior lip gloss was not considered great and this was one of the recommended alternatives. I'm very glad I tried it.\n\nPositives\nThe tint on my lips is a light pink that I absolutely love. It is a very glossy look which is different from the more matte looks I prefer, but I really love how natural the color looks. The formula is very moisturizing and doesn't require constant re-application (it won't stay on if you eat though). \n\nNegatives\nThe downsides are that the product does leak (it got all over my white purse and my sink) and it's close to impossible to clean. The other downside is that it is a bit sticky on the lips. I have long hair that often gets stuck to my lips when I've recently applied it. \n\nOverall, the positives outweigh the negatives. I still like this product and am buying my second bottle. I'm just not going to carry it in my purse again.",
