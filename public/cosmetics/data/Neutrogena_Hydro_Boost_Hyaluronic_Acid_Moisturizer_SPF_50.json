        "comments": "I have been using this sun product for several days and this is my impression of it. \n\nIts texture is really light, it absorbs quickly into my skin and doesn't leave a white cast on my face. It's effect is matte, it doesn't leave my face shiny or greasy which I loved because my skin tends to be combination to oily. It contains hyaluronic acid and vitamin E so it not only protects my skin but also moisturises it. I love that it has SPF 50 because I can use it every day and my skin is really protected during the day. It says on the packaging that the formula is non-comedogenic so it shouldn't cause any acne breakouts and it doesn't contain any fragrance.\n\nI think it's one of my favourite Neutrogena sunscreens and I will buy it again. My face feels hydrated, smooth and glowing when I apply it and it has a sunscreen factor of 50 so it's the best of both worlds, a moisturiser and a sunscreen in one product.",

        "comments": "Please Bring back the SPF 15 Oil Free Moisture Facial Moisturizer. I've tried the Hydro Boost Products: Hyaluronic SPF 50 Moisturizer, the Water Gel, Water Cream even another brand, Glossmetics, but NOTHING is as good as the old, discontinued SPF 15 Oil-Free Moisture Facial Moisturizer Lotion. Why would you discontinue a wonderful product? If sales were down, then you should have began a new aggressive Marketing Plan focusing on the tried and true product which was around for at least 30 years! If you want to market the Hydro-Boost line, at least give us the choice of using what we want. Here is why the discontinued product is better:\n\nIt gives a much better finish…Smooth, soothing, and you can use a little for a dewey glow, or a little more for a beautiful, SMOOTH vibrant glossy shine. Plus, any SPF over 15 or 30 is redundant. 15 is all you need. 50 is just over-kill, and makes the Hydro-boost product feel like thick sunscreen. The discontinued product was 4 ounces compared to the measly 1.7 ounces for the Hydro-Boost products.Bring back the SPF 15 Oil Free Moisture! It wasn't broken, so why did you try to fix something that wasn't broken?",
