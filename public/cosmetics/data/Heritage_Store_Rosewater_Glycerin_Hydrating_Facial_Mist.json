Yes, the formula has changed because it says rose fragrance instead of rose oil, but either way the product has never been authentic. You can buy some rose oil (which is also fragrance btw) and make some yourself if you prefer the old version. I'm giving it two stars because of the fine mist bottle",

At first I tried the one without Glycerin which I wasn't very impressed with because it would just dry off after a few seconds and make barely any difference. But I really loved the refreshing smell of the Rose, so I decided to try the one with Glycerin and really liked it. Now, I know that this product has mixed reviews, which is understandable because we all need to know that everyone's skin is different. This mist makes my skin very soft, a little bit sticky but I don't mind because I use it before applying Hyaluronic acid serum. They go very well together!",

I needed to get my fussy partner into skincare because it drives me crazy watching his lovely deep skin get abused by his pimple popping hobby.\nI already have the \"lemon\" part covered with having him use vit C with Sunscreen daily, but I just could not scout out a rosewater based spray that wasn't just a cocktail of essential oils or the rose is so diminished you don't even get the real fragrance. \nI then stumbled on this after trying several face sprays - either he was complaining they were smelly or I was displeased with the lack of hydration from the fake rose concoctions. This is PERFECT. 3 ingredients, the real smell, beautiful hydration - this is the real deal. Since this is just the real ingredients and nothing more, this is perfect for any skin type as long as you are making sure your skin is responding well to everything else you give it. I have dry skin, partner has oily skin and we love it equally. I will absolutely be stealing this too and a fusspot pimple popper is now happily spraying his face and enjoying real rosewater.",

        "comments": "This was NEVER real rosewater. You don't make rosewater by combining water with rose essential oil, anyone can do that. Rosewater is created by distilling the plant. Yes, the formula has changed because it says rose fragrance instead of rose oil, but either way the product has never been authentic. You can buy some rose oil (which is also fragrance btw) and make some yourself if you prefer the old version. I'm giving it two stars because of the fine mist bottle",
