The photo-enzyme peeling pads have really cleared up my blackheads and left my skin feeling super hydrated which causes additional breakouts or burning. I also love cutting the sheets and using to smooth side for a quick spot-treatment face mask every other night. The smell is a little medicinal, but doesn't still around long at all. Took a chance on these and really enjoy the results. Definitely a critical addition to a skincare routine for gentle exfoliation.",

I haven't noticed much of an improvement in my skin since I started using them. They don't feel very astringent so I'm honestly not too sure if the \"peeling pad\" claim is true. My face feels slightly sticky after using them - like I used a toner pad or a serum. The smell doesn't linger, so if you're not sensitive to smells, you might be fine. I'm going to finish the container because it's not easy for me to return to Ulta - if it was I would definitely be returning them. I will NOT be repurchasing though.",

I used the product as a mask the first time to let it really sink in and the next day, I had several tiny blackheads surface and come out when I touched my skin. A few under the surface zits also came to a head. My skin looks glowy and I'm really looking forward to long term results! \n\nI do agree with another reviewer's comments that the product leaves your skin a little sticky, but I think a follow up of moisturizer would get rid of it. Also, the tweezers in the box are a nice idea, but impractical. It's too difficult to just grab one pad quickly.",

        "comments": "These things smell absolutely terrible. The best I can describe them as smelling like is fertilizer. I wish I would have known that before purchasing them. I haven't noticed much of an improvement in my skin since I started using them. They don't feel very astringent so I'm honestly not too sure if the \"peeling pad\" claim is true. My face feels slightly sticky after using them - like I used a toner pad or a serum. The smell doesn't linger, so if you're not sensitive to smells, you might be fine. I'm going to finish the container because it's not easy for me to return to Ulta - if it was I would definitely be returning them. I will NOT be repurchasing though.",
