It does a great job of hydrating.",

This is not ment to help with acne. I first double cleanse (cerva   Fw and cerva micellar water), then I use this toner, serum, this toner, moisturizer. I keep to a simple routine. If I'm more oily, before I put this toner on, I will use a toner that cleanses oily skin and then use this toner after. A lot of issues stem from having not enough moister or too much moisture. This product ingredient list is great and shouldn't cause irritation. I felt no kind of tingling or irritation for the month I've been using it.",

        "comments": "I have combination skin (oily in my t zone and chin area and dry cheeks and forehead) and it is very sensitive and acne prone, especially in my chin area. I used to use the Mario Badesco Rose mist as a toner along with the acne face wash and the A.H.A. Ceramide moisturizer by Mario Badesco. It wasn't doing anything for my acne, wasn't making it better or worse, so I decided to switch to a Kiehl's regimen. This toner doesn't dry my skin out after cleansing and after I'm done, there's always particulates on the cotton pad. It makes me feel like it's doing something. I love that it's oil free, as I am already oily enough. I have noticed that my skin seems more even and doesn't get as oily throughout the day. You get a good amount for the price and I've been using it for 3 weeks and it seems like I haven't made a dent in it, there's still plenty of product in there. The only downside is that it arrived to me broken, the little hinged cap on the top was broken off and a bit of it was broken off. Luckily, it's still usable, the part that clicks in to the spout was still intact. Overall, I'm enjoying this toner, skin feels soft and clean after using it.",

I have faithfully used Kiehl's products for over 5 years and have loved all of them, but I've been waiting for a collection that targets dehydrated skin without adding oil, or oily skin without over drying. I'm so happy this collection is finally here!\n\nI bought both the Ultra Facial Oil-Free Cleanser and Toner, and after using them for only 3 days now, I can already see an improvement in my skin. This new collection really cleans your skin without any drying effects. In fact, it actually locks moisture in! After only 3 days, my skin feels much softer and I've noticed that my skin is much less oily.\n\nI highly recommend the new Ultra Facial Oil-Free product line to anyone with oily, dehydrated skin. I'm sure other skin types would benefit as well.\n\nThank you Kiehl's for this wonderful product line!",
