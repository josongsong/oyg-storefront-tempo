Niacinamide & Caffeine Eye Bright Cream is a super-smooth and dense cream that almost instantly absorbs into my skin. It's light green in color and has a minty smell, which almost makes me think I have tricked myself into thinking it's more cooling than it truly is. This cream is easily spread around my eye area, which is important so that I don't pull that delicate skin or apply any stress that may cause additional wrinkles or fine lines. A generous amount of the product leaves my eye area dewy-looking and plumped up with moisture so much so that my fine lines are all but gone after a few minutes. Thank you to Kopari for providing this product to me for my honest and unbiased feedback.",

After trialing this product for 2 weeks I didn't really see that much of a difference under my eye area. Please keep in mind that I get told all the time how good my skin looks for someone who is almost 40.  I did appreciate that the eye cream wasn't gel like but was still light weight and was easy to blend into the skin. I didn't notice any brightening or reducing under eye puffiness. I did think it helped in tightening the under eye area and preventing future wrinkles. I sort of wish it came with a cooling eye wand to glide across the eye area to help with anyone that has puffiness in that area. Overall, it's a nice eye cream that is worth looking into if you are looking for a product to brighten and depuff if you have those concerns.",
