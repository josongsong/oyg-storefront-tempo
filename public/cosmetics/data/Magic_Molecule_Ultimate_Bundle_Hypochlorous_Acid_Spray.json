Went to the dermatologist and tried a few things as they weren't working - so flaky and itchy. Ended up mixing 50/50 ketoconazole/hydrocortisone several times a week with a few days off in between....for a year! Never fully cleared, so annoying. Got this for my son because he is too lazy to put the creams on nightly the derm gave him for his cystic acne. I was like - what can I lose. So I sprayed it all over my face and my ears a few times a day.....NO DRY PATCHES! Itch gone........no dry, painful flakes in there. It is literally unbelievable! Now my husband is spraying himself all the time too because it made such a difference.",

Being 25 and still getting consistent acne has been draining in many ways. Ive been using this for a few weeks now and not only is my skin calmer and acne almost gone, my skin has this nice glow and almost glass skin shine to it now. I have very oily skin and it's definitely not an oily shine at all, if that makes sense. This is the only thing that I've introduced to my skin care in the past 6 months(ish) so i know its this product doing it. Also I've been using it to calm bug bites and even spray on my dog whos been experiencing skin allergies. I havent even used 1/4 of the bottle and I spray pretty generously. I will definitely keep purchasing!!",

I am very picky about my spray bottles/mist and this exceeds my expectations and I wish more products of mine had the same mist-er. \n\nSecondly, this product doesn't break me out (acne prone, dry skin) like other antimicrobial spraye have, and I feel super fresh and clean after. It also leaves a nice glow and my skin feels soft. It's a giant bottle that will last a long time. In my opinion it is worth the price. It doesn't have any weird smell either.",

        "comments": "Okay, story time. I have had bad skin since I was a child. I have eczema, mild psoriasis, extremely dry skin, ultra sensitive skin, perioral dermatitis, I am acne-prone (blackheads, whiteheads, cysts, you name it). When I say I have dry skin, it cracks and peels in large sections. When I say I have sensitive skin, a speck of dirt or dust in the wind could touch it and I have a painful dermatitis outbreak which takes more than a week to heal (that actually happened). I tried everything over the counter—a few products over the years have helped calm my skin a bit but nothing got to the root of the problem. I saw multiple dermatologists and each one gave me different triggers—hormones, diet, skin care products with heavy chemicals—and I did both oral and topical products. Nothing helped. A year ago, I saw an advertisement for MM and decided I would try it. What could it hurt? Well it didn't hurt. Instead, I healed.   Now my skin is clear and glowing and supple. I use this every time I wash my face and then apply my other products on top of it. The dermatitis is gone. The cysts are gone. The eczema and psoriasis are gone. Even a patch of embarrassing granuloma annulare (a side effect of my hypoglycemia) I have struggled with all around my neck has disappeared for the first time since I was 13 (I'm 31 now).   My skin looks so good, many people believe I'm in my early 20s and are shocked to learn how old I really am. MM is an absolute miracle in a bottle!! I am a forever customer so please never stop producing this! Nothing else compares to this one simple bottle of a wish come true. Thank you a million times, MM!",

        "comments": "I want it to be magic. I really do. Maybe I just need to adjust my expectations? Maybe \"magic\" is an oversell? I have spots all around my hairline and the edges of my face that especially in winter, get pink, feel dry, and occasionally flaky. Eczema is the worst. I used Magic Molecule twice (or more) a day for two weeks and maybe things sliiiightly improved? I took pics to compare and it definitely wasn't a night-and-day thing for me. But things didn't get worse, so that's something. I think I was expecting a Miracle Molecule. Spraying it on my face felt very bougie and luxurious, I will say that. I might try another bottle. I really want it to work, and I'm sad it wasn't a drastic thing for me. One thing I'll flag that felt off - the bottles I ordered were shipped \"naked\" during whatever label shortage the company was having. Which to me was totally fine, I couldn't care less. But then I read that hydrochlorous acid is quite unstable and decomposes over time into essentially water - and that exposure to light expedites that process quite dramatically. I mostly had my bottles in my medicine cabinet, but I don't feel like I was instructed to keep it in a dark place and wonder if by the end of my second bottle, I was spraying extremely expensive water on my face, crossing my fingers that it would have an impact on my less-than-perfect skin. I'd love the company to speak to how light affects Magic Molecule spray and maybe to throw a discount in the direction of people like me who were sent a light-sensitive solution in a clear bottle.",
