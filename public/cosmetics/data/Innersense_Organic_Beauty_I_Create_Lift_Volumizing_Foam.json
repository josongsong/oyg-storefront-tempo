Usually, i can't trust how good a product works right after getting my hair done because my hair always looks great the first wash or two.  But while I have a lot of lift and bounce, I have very little definition and my hair feels dry and is so fuzzy / frizzy.  IT NEVER FEELS LIKE THIS IMMEDIATELY AFTER A HAIR APPOINTMENT, NEVER. Everything else in my routine was the same.  So maybe if you have really oily fine hair, this could be good.  But I just don't trust it long term if it can leave my hair feeling dry so fast after a hair appointment.  I will accept a bit of fuzz for the sake of lift, but not at the sake of no definition.",

My hair doesn't respond well (looks like a plastic dish sponge - loss of definition/fuzzy, etc) to refresher sprays or wetting after it's been styled. I purchased this along with the hydrate trio because I am trying to master a wash and go. I've used many brands but they've all ended in a wash and stay. I will say that I was blaming my technique for the results, but I've tried different techniques and I'm not sure it's just user error. I will say that my results were slightly better with Innersense than the other brands, but I wouldn't call them successful. I was absolutely impressed with how it made my hair feel ( soft and ease of detangling was the best of all the brands I've tried) but my second day hair looked like a dried sea sponge. I will try to use the products again after I purchase a hair dryer. Air drying may not be best for me to achieve this style and is the last thing I have left to try. I tried this with a leave in from another brand and I did notice my twist out was &quot;fluffier&quot; than usual. It didn't stretch the days between washing any longer but I will continue to use it for wet setting styles.",

        "comments": "Where do I even begin? I'm a new customer and ordered the Hydrating Hairbath, Hydrating Cream Conditoner, I Create Quiet Calm Curl Control and Volumizing Foam. I have naturally tight curly hair and was excited to give these a try after reading all the rave reviews, but after my first wash I was devastated. My hair was like STRAW. Two more washes later and my hair was even drier, more lifeless, and completely devoid of any curl definition. When I emailed Customer Service they said I shouldn't be using the Hydrating Collection but should be using the Color Collection instead. So let me get this right. I have naturally tight curly hair (never had straight hair in my life) and somehow I should know to NOT buy the products for curly hair? Huh? Since I apparently bought the wrong stuff, I then had to spend $20+ mailing everything back (UGH) and dished out another $70+ on new products. (Would it have killed you guys to send me a prepaid shipping label and simply deducted $5-$7 from my refund like every other retailer?) Then I come to find out that the 2.37 oz Volumizing Foam that I returned wasn't eligible because it's considered travel sized?! Where on the website does it say that it's travel sized? I get it. *Technically* it's below the 3oz TSA allowance, but technically so is the 1 oz Harmonic Healing Oil, which you accepted. And I know you guys have an entire TRAVEL trio line because they're LABELED AS TRAVEL KITS. This was not labeled as such. I was willing to forgive the destruction of my hair (which is still recovering) and annoyingly excessive return shipping costs, but 3 strikes and you're out, Innersense. You literally just lost a customer over $12 because your overall customer experience stinks.",
