I think Hot Tools sells a crappy version to Ulta because I've bought Hot Tools from Sallys that were great. Was expensive and did not try until after retun window closed. The only way to get a curl to last even 10 minutes is so set it in place with hair pins. But is damaging my hair so much I think it is going in the garbage.",

I purchased this one because I've always liked this brand and the barrel size was perfect. I've tried (and failed) with this iron for months thinking that maybe my hair was just changing or it was certain products that I was using, but it would NEVER ever hold a curl. Then I started reading reviews and I realized that it was the curling iron. I have a ton of hair, but ultimately the strands themselves are fine. I tried different temperatures, holding for different amounts of time….nothing worked. Unfortunately, I can't return it but now I'm looking for a new one.",

It has the temperature gauge so you can choose how hot you want it, which is great bc I watch how much heat I put in my hair.  I also like the fact that it doesn't snag my hair and it heats up fast...i would recommend this product.",

It definitely works just fine but it is heavier than most irons I have used in the past and the disproportionately skinny handle makes it awkward to hold.  The clip is very strong but the overall design increases the likelihood that hair gets caught in the area where the clip attaches to the iron itself.  Also when hot, the iron gives off a kind of \"sour\" smell.  I originally thought it was just because the product was new but after using it for over a week now i noticed the smell is not lessening.  So while I would still recommend this product because it is good quality, I say...for the money shop around a little before you make your decision.",
