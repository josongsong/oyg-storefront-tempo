I love the way this bumble and bumble heat protectant didnt make my hair frizzy, didnt leave a sticky/stiff residue on my strands, and it smells so good. My hair doesnt feel dry after using the iron over it which is a huge pro for me. Ive only used it one time but was overall happy with the outcome. My only complain at this time is that i do feel like it made my hair a little greasy. Not sure if this is user error and i just used too much or if its a common occurrence with this product but regardless, a little dry shampoo and hairspray covered that up just fine. I would repurchase! \n\nFor reference i have pin straight super fine hair that gets the ends bleached for a balayage 2x/year",

It's also helped prevent any more damage to my hair since my flat iron uses a heat of 400 degrees. The scent is heavenly as well. I get many compliments on my hair. This product helps hydrate my hair, add shine, decrease frizz, create soft/silky feel of hair, & prevents further damage. I did receive this product free for testing purposes. However, I will be purchasing when I run out! This product is better than any other heat protectant I've tried. My hair is very complicated & this product is a miracle in a bottle!",

It makes my hair feel weird after I straighten it (I let the product fully dry on my hair BEFORE straightening it) when I run my hands through my hair, it would feel dry, starchy, crunchy, tight, I don't know how to perfectly describe it, but I do know it's not the best feeling. I'm going to stick with the other heat protectant from this same brand, the orange and white bottle. That UV/Heat protectant isn't as watery as this one, and it is slightly heavier when sprayed, but it dries down light, and makes my hair feel so soft! Not to mention, the smell is SO much better, it lasts a long time too! The only thing this product did do was make my hair appear less frizzy and appear more shiner.",
