There was a good amount of serem but it didnt feel hydrating at all. My skin felt like it was burning too. And the burning feeling went on for about 30-40 minutes after i removed the patches. Another thing is I didnt notice much of a difference to my dark circles or puffiness. I noticed the tinest difference, but there are definetly better eye patches ive used that made a world of a difference.",

        "comments": "These are decent but honestly I've used better eye masks. Really love the packaging and look of this product and it's good quality. The eye masks are perfect for a get ready with me or self care post because they are really holographic and glittery, super cute. The application process was super easy, just place under the eyes, remove after a specified amount of time, rub in excess. Unfortunately there wasn't any excess because the masks were kind of dry even tho they were in great packaging. Personally I prefer masks with more serum. I didn't notice much of a difference after use. Overall I enjoyed them but probably wouldn't purchase. Gifted by I Dew Care for my honest opinion.",
