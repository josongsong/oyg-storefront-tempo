Using this treatment has made my lips more manageable than I've had them in years. I like to put it on under an occlusive lip mask at night (the Ulta Night Shift Mask or maybe Vaseline), and my lips look perfect in the morning. This is great to use at any time of day, as I love the slippy feeling on the lips, and it smells delicious (kinda like birthday cake or chocolate or something?). I use the clear version. I'll be buying more for sure. The price is fantastic.",

There is the most subtle, sweet scent and absolutely no taste or aftertaste. I don't need to keep reapplying it but I'm constantly reaching for it because it is such a pleasant experience to apply. I'm almost shocked at how good this is, I like it better than a lot of my high end lip balms. The fact that it's so affordable is the cherry on top.",

I got the darkest shade and it smells sweet, not sure if they all smell the same or if they have their own scents but this is a very good product and is glossy too. The only I'll say about this is that I wish it lasted longer, but thats okay with me because i actually love to reapply this. I would ABSOLUTELY love if there were more shades released, Im wishing for a yellow one in a mango, or fruit flavor, but not lemon. I would recommend buying, also it doesnt taste like anything, but i wished it did. Another bonus with this is that when layering it ontop of lip liners, it doesnt leave any dry patches or clumps!",

Still I couldn't be happier and I hope they never get rid of this! I use this as a nighttime routine and it actually lasts through the night which I've never found on any lip treatment. My lips are noticeably more moisturized the next day of use. I wish I had discovered this sooner, it'll be a life saver for the harsh midwest winters!
