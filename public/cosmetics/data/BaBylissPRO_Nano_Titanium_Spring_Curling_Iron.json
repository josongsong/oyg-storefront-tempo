I love the straightener from this brand so I thought the curler would be great. It does not hold your hair in the barrel so your hair will keep falling out and you will have to keep re-curling the same piece. I had to curl my hair with it twice before I gave up and went over it with my smaller curling wand. I was curling my hair the way I always have so I am not sure why it would not work with this curler. Would not recommend.",
