        "comments": "If you want to try the black honey collection this does save you a little money. I had already tried the black honey lip gloss separately and i think the lip cheek oil is better quality. It's less sticky than the gloss, more versitle, and the pigment spreads more evenly when applying. I do agree with the other reviews about the carrying case \"clutch\" that is included with the set, its laughable that they're marketing it as anything. It is made out of cardboard and I immediately threw mine away in my recycling bin, its just basic consumer packaging. Otherwise the products ring true to clinique.",
