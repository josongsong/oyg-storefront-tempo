I saw this product on TikTok and gave it a try.. When I tell you that I'm PARANOID to run out of this stuff or that it'll get discontinued, I'm not lying. My local stores and local Ulta rarely have it in stock.. so I order 4-5 of them at a time online. When I first started using this, I felt like there was a little bit of a sticky residue around my brows but literally that can be cleaned up with a Q-tip. The trick to this product is after you put it on your brows— first press the brow hairs down and shape them and then (this is important*) let the product completely dry before going in with a brow pencil/brow pen. I use the NYX Lift and Snatch brow pen. When I first bought this, I thought I had to have thick brows to make it work (which I don't). But that's not true.. take what ya got! Shape them, and then use a brow pen. It doesn't matter if your brows are more thin than other videos have shown with this product. It's possible to make it work! I do it every day! I hope this never gets discontinued 😩🙏🏻",

        "comments": "I was so excited to try this cause of the whole being a dupe for the Anastasia brow freeze (which I own but it's expensive so I was looking for an everyday product that didn't break the bank). I love the laminated brow look. I was blessed with good brows naturally so I don't have to fill them in and have thin longish hairs so they're very manageable. But since my brow hairs are long I need a brow gel. So I got this and I even got the little brow spooly that the brought out w this product. The spooly is great! This not so much! It works for a little bit but after an hr or so my hairs start loosing the laminated look and start falling down. So I tried using more product and the same thing happened but my brows started getting white fluffs from the product build up. Also it feels quite heavy on the brows and kind of greasy. \n\nMight have been made to be a dupe for the Anastasia brow freeze but DEFINITELY do not hit the mark!",
