It has the perfect balance of being effective without feeling harsh on my skin. After using it, my face feels incredibly smooth, fresh, and clean.\n\nThe texture is just right—it has fine exfoliating particles that help remove dead skin and impurities without causing any irritation. I've noticed my complexion looks brighter and feels softer after each use. Plus, it has a pleasant, light scent that makes it feel like a little spa moment at home.\n\nIf you're looking for a gentle yet powerful exfoliator you can use regularly, I highly recommend this one. It really delivers results without stripping your skin. Love it!",

You gave no warning of the reformulation, kept same name, but now with kiwi vs orange, upped the price, and shrunk the quantity. After many years and thousands of dollars bought in products, you have managed to point me in another direction for the future. I'm very disappointed.  Another customer lost.",
