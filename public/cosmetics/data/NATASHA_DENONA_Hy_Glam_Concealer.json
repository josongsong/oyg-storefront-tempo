The HY-GLAM concealer shade range includes 50 shades and 6 correcting shades. Providing a perfect match for all skin tones and specific concerns, thanks to a color-matching system that is based on 6 overtones (fair, light, medium, tan, dark, deep) and 4 undertones (neutral/cool, yellow/golden/olive, peach/warm, rosy/pink).When using your perfectly matched shade, the concealer will blend seamlessly into the skin, leaving a natural finish, and wears up to 19 hrs long.Work With Your Skin ConcernsMinor under-eye circles/Spot concealing: Use one or all of our shade-matching methods to detect your ideal shade that matches your skin tone best.Blue or Purple Under-Eye Circles: Select a concealer from the PEACH group matching your overtone (P1-P11), or a corrector shade from your overtone group (C1-C6).Dark Brown Under-Eye Circles: Select a concealer from the ROSY group matching your overtone (R1-R9).Hyperpigmentation: Select a corrector shade from your overtone group (C1-C6). After blending in the corrector shade, follow with your skin-matched shade to even out your skin tone.Application: The flocked-drop-shaped applicator has a hollow reservoir, to grip the ideal amount of product. Use the flat side of the applicator when applying under the eye and large areas of the face for fuller coverage.For spot concealing, use the pointed tip of the applicator and blend with a makeup sponge, foundation brush, or a clean finger.The nutrient-packed and highly pigmented formula gives a full glam performance that can also be toned down to a more sheer, natural look. The HY-GLAM concealer can be easily used in the same routine as other complexion products: after primer or without, before or after foundation, and with or without powder.NATASHA'S PRO TIP: If you have creased under eyes, let the concealer set for a couple of minutes after application. Then gently blend your undereye from the outer corner inwards, using a clean and dry finger.

However, there seemed to be a shortage, likely due to her work on ramping up foundation production, and Ulta was the only store that had N4 in stock.  After waiting a month for my order because Ulta lost it in shipping (and threatened to charge me for it if it shows up and I don't return it),  I was disappointed to see that the undertone was much more yellow than the original release.",

        "comments": "So… the shade Y2 is a great concealer with just enough brightening for my pale, cool olive, mature 53 year old skin -with crazy dark undereye circles, that are mainly due to deep set eyes, but which get SO much worse if i'm out late, or under stress - but i digress..,\n\nUntil recently tarte shape tape in Light Sand, first the original (god i miss having the taut skin it worked on. It was perfect for me, soooo brightening) and then the creamy bersion, eh, in ever decreasing amounts, then maybelline age rewind (still great) were my Go-to's.   \n\nMy friend raved about this, so I originally bought this in the light peach with a coupon.  Totally wrong shade, but i loved the formula.  So i bought Y2.   Perfect.   \n\nI lightly set with my beloved, tried and true Laura Mercier Under eye brightening powder-not-much-of-a-powder :-) and I have no dryness throughout the day, and of course no creasing thanks to this formula.   \n\nOne thing i've noticed is, if i do this first, and then finish my face, then somehow my 53 year old undereyes (that are still, btw *cough* well taken care of), look amazing.   I'm not going to pass for 30 again. But thats not my thing either.  I look good and I'm pleased with what i see",

        "comments": "This product was gifted by Natasha Denona. I used this on my under eyes and to cover up blemishes/dark spots. The color was a pretty good match for my skin tone, a hair lighter but that's what I prefer especially when it comes to my under eyes.  It blended fairly well with a brush and a sponge. On blemishes the coverage was ok. I did have to do a couple layers most times to get it to cover up to high medium coverage. On my under eyes I was a bit more underwhelmed by the results. I do have the usual tiny fine lines coming diagonally from my lash line but no wrinkles or fine lines around the rest of my under eye. When wearing this I found that it seemed somewhat dry looking even before setting it with powder and immediately emphasized the small lines. After a couple hours it begins to crease around the middle of my under eye which is normally a smooth area. It's a bit like it's drying out the skin and causing it to crepe-up. It does wear all day long but the look isn't that desirable. For me this is better suited as a blemish coverup but I have other concealers that work for both so I wouldn't repurchase it.",
