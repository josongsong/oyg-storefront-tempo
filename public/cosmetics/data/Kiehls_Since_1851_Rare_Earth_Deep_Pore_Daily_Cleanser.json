I think it would be a little harsh on someone with gentle sensitive skin, but even with my picky skin I didn't get any reactions. I love this and I hope it stays around forever! I will use the mask twice a week as well and my skin has improved immensely. I moisturize with the ROC niacinamide cream which drenches into my skin and makes my make up look better and evens my redness out. I highly recommend this wash if you feel like you have some clogged pores and oily skin or if you want to use minimally to refresh !",

I thought it to be a weird thing my body was doing. About a month later, my other eye did the same thing. After speaking about it with a coworker, she asked if I changed anything in my routine and I told her I changed face washes. She said to stop using it. To my surprise, I've had no issues since. \n\nMy partner continued to use the wash as we thought I was having a weird allergic reaction to it (mind you, I don't have any allergies). Then, the same thing happened to his eye. And I'm not talking a little swelling, both of our eyes were almost swollen shut and I am too embarrassed to post a picture. So, I'm not sure what is in this product but it caused more harm than good. I wouldn't recommend.",

My face feels thoroughly cleansed without making it feel dry or tight. Even though it's exfoliating, it feels very gentle and soothing. After I cleanse with this I apply The Ordinary Buffet serum and it absorbs much better after cleansing with this vs other cleansers I've used. I could not be happier with this purchase.",

I had purchased this product on a whim walking through Nieman's about 6 months ago, and I am delighted to say that it is one of my all time favorites that I can NOT live without and probably one of the most inexpensive purchases I have ever made for what it has done for me. I am a daily heavy makeup user, so I need a really good makeup remover. I use either a cleansing oil or a cleansing milk to break up all the crud I put on my face. Also, I have very oily and cystic acne prone skin, so all of that makeup does not help with my skin. So I try to be very diligent with cleaning my face very well every day. I have been an avid Proaciv user for over 15 years, but lately, I have been noticing that either my skin is building up a tolerance to it or my body and/or hormones may be changing (new decade in life) and it isn't doing the trick anymore, also the cost of it has added up over the years. So it was time for me to start the search for something new. So for the heck of it, I thought I would go back to the basics and just wash my face with my makeup remover and try this deep pore daily cleanser after it because I know that the makeup remover would not give me a 100% deep down clean and it also does leave a film. After about a week of sticking to that simple routine, I noticed a HUGE change in my skin!! My face, especially my pores, felt so clean and were getting smaller, my skin was not dried out and not as oily, my makeup went on a whole lot smoother and lasted a lot longer with less touch ups, and my acne was going away on it's own without any new flare ups! I could not believe it! Going back to the basics was all I needed. I recommend this to anyone and everyone. It's a good value for the price and you only need maybe a dime sized amount to wash your entire face and neck and the tube will last you for about 6 month! It is so worth it! Even if you aren't an avid daily makeup user like me, if you want a nice deep down fresh clean feeling after a long day to wash away all the dirt or yuck that is in the air that can build up in your pores or on your skin, this will give you the kind of clean feeling you get after getting a good facial! It's a must buy!",

I switched back to the Rare Earth Deep Poor to try it again as I love the masque from this line. I found that the second round with the Rare Earth cleanser was not as effective. Post cleanse is great but I find that my skin is oily not long after cleansing. The Ultra Oil-Free works much better with my oily skin. The Ultra Oil-Free combined with the Rare Earth Masque work wonderfully together!",
