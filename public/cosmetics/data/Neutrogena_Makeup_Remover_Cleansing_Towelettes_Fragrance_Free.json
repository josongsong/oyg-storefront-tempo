I just ran out of these and went online to purchase and noticed the packaging looking different, so went to check reviews and saw so many new negative ones about swelling and burning. As someone with sensitive skin, I quickly went to read the ingredients, and noticed some really bad changes. They now have Chlorphenesin, which has caused me allergic reactions in other products and triggers acne for lots of people. Good thing I didn't blindly repurchase. I checked my local store and they had switched everything over to the new version expect for the purple calming version, so I grabbed the last one. I'll be switching to Pacifica or Clinique, which don't have such bad ingredients or reviews.",

I think they work just as well as the regular wipes, but aren't quite as soft to me. Don't get me wrong, I still like them, and they work just fine, but I think these are less soft, and there isn't a fresh scent left behind. I'd imagine these would be great for people with sensitive skin or have sensitive noses.",

These wipes did not seem like they did a good job of removing my foundation (which I use minimally) and did nothing to remove my mascara (which is NOT waterproof).  It is advertised to remove makeup in one swipe which it did not and I was rubbing for quite awhile. I finally gave up and got out my micellar water because i didn't want to keep tugging on my skin or eyes. I don't know if I just got a bad pack of wipes or if this was a normal experience but I do not wear heavy makeup and any other wipe i have tried removes everything without a trace. I decided to try these thinking they'd be gentler and more efficient (as in less rubbing my face). I was very disappointed with the results.",
