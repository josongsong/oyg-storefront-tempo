It says it helps cut time in half, and for me I'm able to blow dry my hair, smooth it out, and air wrap some curls and be done in less than 20 minutes! I highly recommend you all try it out",

If you are looking for a replacement for the Redken Satinwear 02, look no further! This is most comparable to that product. It works very well. I gave it three stars for the smell. Like others have said, the smell is not great. Nothing masks it. However, it's benefits out weigh the smell.

This product has been a game changer! I have very thick long hair and one pump is enough for me. My blow outs and curls have lasted a whole week. It says it helps cut time in half, and for me I'm able to blow dry my hair, smooth it out, and air wrap some curls and be done in less than 20 minutes! I highly recommend you all try it out",
