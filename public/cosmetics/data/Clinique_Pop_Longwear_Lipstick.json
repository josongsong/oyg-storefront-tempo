        "comments": "I bought a few of these lipsticks during a sale recently and these are my conclusions…\n\nI purchased Beach Pop, Bare Pop, Blush Pop, Clove Pop. With this particular line of lipsticks, it almost seems like Clinique just piecemealed together a bunch of random colors and formulas and put matching packaging on them.\n\nBeach Pop is a creamy opaque matte. I would describe the color as a very cool toned deep rosy brown. The lipstick broke with the first application. I think this was because it is so creamy and soft. Based on this formulation alone, I wouldn't have expected this to be coined as a long lasting lipstick..\n\nClove Pop is my favorite of the 4 i bought. The formula is not like Beach Pop's, even though both are in the same line and both are described as matte. Clove Pop is a lot lighter in weight and less creamy in texture, making it feel less moisturizing compared to Beach Pop, however lending to its ability to last longer throughout the day . I would describe the color as a soft neutral rosy brown.\n\nBare Pop and Blush Pop seem to be the same formula and very similar colors. They are both shiny and sheer. Both are what I'd describe as blushing nude tones, however Bare Pop is just slightly cooler toned than Blush Pop, which to me seemed counterintuitive since the word \"blush\" is usually associated with cool mauve tones and \"bare\" is usually associated with warm nudes.",

        "comments": "I have extremely sensitive skin. If I wear any lipstick or lip gloss that has blue dye in it my entire face starts burning 1/3 of the way through the day. I can tell just by looking at these new Clinique Pop colors that they all have blue dye in them. They are all cool tones. Why did you do away with the beautiful brown tone lipsticks?? I loved them!! my favorite is Luscious and I can't find it at all on your website now, or anywhere else, for that matter. I wanted to stock up but can't even do that. Why do you people always have to fix what isn't broken. Why can't you just ADD to the collection instead of CHANGE the collection??? I am soooooo disappointed in Clinique. Unfortunately I'm stuck with the brand as that is how sensitive my skin is. I searched by trial and error for years to find a brand my skin would tolorate, both skin care and cosmetics. Now you're ruining it for me. Thanks a lot.",
