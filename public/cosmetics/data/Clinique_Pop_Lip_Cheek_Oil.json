I believe if you had glass like skin, with no visible pores, it would work great. On my not-glassy, large pore (inherited from my dad) skin, it looked blotchy. It sunk into pores and sat on the rest of my skin. Am returning both colors. Would recommend as a lip oil.",

But using this on my lips I feel like the formula is just a bit too thin. I think it might be by design since this is designed to use on cheeks as well and the thin formula makes it more blendable, but I don't love that in a lip product",

I had really high hopes for this given it's Clinique, but I'm afraid it didn't live up to its' name. I really like the almost lipstick in black honey.\nI would like to start by saying that this product works great for the cheeks. Use and blend-ability was great. It was pigmented sufficiently, and spread nicely around the cheek. It's a beautiful sheer color.\nAs for a lip oil, I put it on, put my lips together like normal, and then all the lip oil was lining my lips. The texture is too thin. Further, it was gone in 15-20 minutes, requiring a lot of reapplication. One would think that, if the lip oil was soaking in so fast, it would at least be good for the skin on my lips. Sadly, it was not. It was drying and my mid-day my lips were peeling from being chapped. \nOverall, I don't recommend this as a product for your lips given the detriments. I will keep it, but only use it on my cheeks.",

I like the OG stick, I do not like the new gloss formula or shade variation of black honey, it's brown and dreary compared to the OG and the new lip oil. This is the BEST lip oil/gloss I have ever used! I love everything about it! It is NOT sticky whatsoever, is wears down evenly and does not get gooey in the corners of cakey on the lip line as so many glosses do. The depth of the color is dimensional, and is SO pretty. It allows your own color to show through AND has great pigmentation of it's own. Too many glosses or oils have little to no pigment. Now, CLINIQUE,    many of my favorite Clinique products have been discontinued, and there is NO replacing them. I am a product junkie and have a library of beauty awareness and knowledge to back this up. PLEASE, you MUST make this PERMANENT!!! And, if you really want to be wise for your own benefit and for the best of your customers, you also need to use this same formula and add OTHER COLORS. I do not buy your glosses, never have liked any formula of them. The short-lived matte lip in Cake was perfect but was killed. I like lip oils but most have little to no pigment. I do not wear clear gloss, I need COLOR. You need this in a Pink Honey, a Red Honey, a Nude Honey, and a Melon or Peach Honey. The packaging is great, and the product is THE BEST. PLEASE listen to the requests of your loyal customers. Years ago you had a color-extension of the OG Black Honey. They were great but not marketed well so they died. Your former cream eye shadows, both formulas, are still unable to be truly \"replaced\". The extensive color selections were super long-wearing, no creasing, highly-pigmented, and NO one else to date has anything like them. The cool shimmery pink, the cool shimmery violet, etc are not in any other line. Shadow sticks do not compare to these. \nPlease make this permanent  add more shades to this exceptional formula!!!!",

        "comments": "[I received this product in exchange for my honest review]\n\nFor the lips, this was a cute, quick, very hydrating formula with just a hint of a tint that I'm looking for with that shine. The downside is that it will stay on a full two second before I've smacked it or licked it off (unknowingly.) The formula is a bit heavy, so I can just feel it there, and I unintentionally rub my lips together until it's all gone almost immediately. It is a shame because it is a very good product otherwise.\n\nI'm not sure how I was supposed to use it for the cheeks, though. There were no directions on the packaging, and since I've never used a lip oil as a cheek product, I'm sure I wasn't doing it right, however, it was too sticky no matter how I used it. If I used it on top of foundation, it took off the foundation, and there's no way it's going under foundation. It seems like it should be used for natural skin maybe? The glow I got was absolutely DIVINE! But the color wasn't worth the oil residue that my hair kept getting sticking myself into.",
