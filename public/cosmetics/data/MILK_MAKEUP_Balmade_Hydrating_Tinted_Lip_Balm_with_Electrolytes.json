        "comments": "Complimentary from milkmakeup I've been impressed with Milk Makeup products in the past and I was excited to get my hands on the Balmade Hydrating Tinted Lip Balm in Refresher. I was intrigued as I had never heard of a lip balm having electrolytes to assist with hydration. Basically, it has zinc, copper, and magnesium to help moisturize your lips. It also has banana juice, coconut, and aloe extracts meant to help keep your lips hydrated as well as smooth and condition them if they're chapped. The color I tried promised to be a bright pink and have a \"raspberry rave flavor.\" I don't feel it has much of a tint at all which was a bit disappointing when I was expecting a hot pink. It is smooth going on, isn't tacky or sticky, and smells fruity which I loved. It doesn't have a taste which I am thankful for as I don't really like to taste my lip products! It gives a pretty and natural shine while enhancing my lips. The lip balm doesn't last very long and while my lips certainly didn't feel dry after using it, I am not going to say they felt excessively moisturized either. If you want a smooth lip gloss that isn't sticky and has minimal (if any) tint, this one is for you. While I didn't find it overly hydrating, it was nice and smooth to put on so I did find myself reaching for it quite often!",

        "comments": "Before trying this balm, my lips were often a little dry and lacked smoothness. After applying the Election scent, I noticed an immediate difference — my lips looked plumper, smoother, and much more hydrated. The formula feels really light and non-sticky, which makes it comfortable to wear throughout the day without feeling heavy or greasy. What I especially like is how the hydration lasts for hours, even after talking, drinking, or being outside. The subtle fresh fragrance of Election makes the experience even more enjoyable — it's noticeable but not overpowering. Overall, I'm really happy with how this balm performs. It not only gives instant relief but also leaves my lips soft and healthy-looking with a natural glow. This product was gifted by milkmakeup , but this review reflects my honest and personal experience.",

I love that it's buildable; one swipe is sheer, but a couple more gives a richer pop of color. It's packed with natural oils that keep my lips hydrated for hours, and I notice less flakiness even on colder days. The packaging is sleek and easy to toss in my bag, making it perfect for on-the-go touch-ups. A great blend of care and color!\n*Gifted by Milkmakeup*",

I was intrigued as I had never heard of a lip balm having electrolytes to assist with hydration. Basically, it has zinc, copper, and magnesium to help moisturize your lips. It also has banana juice, coconut, and aloe extracts meant to help keep your lips hydrated as well as smooth and condition them if they're chapped. The color I tried promised to be a bright pink and have a \"raspberry rave flavor.\" I don't feel it has much of a tint at all which was a bit disappointing when I was expecting a hot pink. It is smooth going on, isn't tacky or sticky, and smells fruity which I loved. It doesn't have a taste which I am thankful for as I don't really like to taste my lip products! It gives a pretty and natural shine while enhancing my lips. The lip balm doesn't last very long and while my lips certainly didn't feel dry after using it, I am not going to say they felt excessively moisturized either. If you want a smooth lip gloss that isn't sticky and has minimal (if any) tint, this one is for you. While I didn't find it overly hydrating, it was nice and smooth to put on so I did find myself reaching for it quite often!",

I saw that Milk was 5x the points and immediately bought it, I had high hopes for its innovative marketing for \"electrolyte\" lip products but unfortunately it didnt do much for my lips. I adore my Laneige, & my Ole & even quite a fan of Lanolips. But this here felt really pointless. \nUpon application, it made me feel the texture of my slightly dry lips. I waited a little for maybe some hydration that'll feel a little better but even after about 4 minutes, it still felt really thin and pointless.\n\nColor/tint was pretty, I got the dusty rose colored one. \n\nI feel strongly that this could be used on top of gloss/lipstick or something! But I have too many dusty pinks to keep this product.\n\nThis is coming from someone who has to go on a \"no lip purchase\" punishment pretty often 😭😭😭😭",
