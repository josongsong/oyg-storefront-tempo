It stayed so well, didn't cake, and it covered my fine lines and blemishes so well i was asked for my skincare routine!",

It came safety sealed. :) I was so pleased with the product. I have dark skin that is very ruddy (red) and most drugstore products are too yellow for me. This powder is perfect for my complexion and it's not too yellow for me and it's a matte finish. The powder is really finely milled/ jet milled. The powder did not change the color of my foundation and it does settle in without looking powdery or ashy. A little goes a long way. Maybelline has come a long way in what they offer to women like me. I love the packaging. It's easy to open and the cap screws to a tight close. I don't have to worry about spilling product or making a mess. I would suggest that there should be a shade of powder added for Ebony skin. There could be a #45 and a #50 for super dark skin.",

I received the shade \"15-Light\" and right off the bat I thought it looked too dark for me fair to light skin tone, but once I applied it over my liquid foundation, it blended nicely with my skin and looked like a pretty good match. It's definitely not translucent, so it does leave a tint/light wash of color. It set my makeup nicely in the beginning, but began to deteriorate throughout the day. Definitely not long wearing.",
