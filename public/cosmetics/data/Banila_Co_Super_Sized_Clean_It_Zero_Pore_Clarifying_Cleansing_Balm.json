Like full blurry vision for at least 10/15 or basically until I flush my eyes multiple times with water. I don't know what's in this formula but this can't be good for my eyes! \nThis didn't happen using elemis cleaning balms - which I know are a lot more spenny... but my sight is worth it!!",

        "comments": "It works when taking makeup off but I don't generally use it for daily skincare. The scent is a bit odd, and I think the waxy texture is because it's supposed to turn into an oily cleanser after applying. I think it clogged my pores when I was using it consistently, and often felt like I had to use a second cleanser to get the residue off. Not my favorite as a lazy skincare gal but might work for people who regularly double-cleanse.",

The way this thing actually cleanses your face and removes EVERYTHING is insane. I appreciate the spatula to keep the product clean. You don't need more than a pea size to do your entire face so their larger size lasted me a out 3 months and I use it every day. Every! Day! It doesn't have a strong overwhelming smell. It's so unmeasurable that I can't recall what it smells like and I just finished washing my face 10 minutes ago. My skin feels clean, not greasy, and it's so so so soft. I will never use any other Cleanser or makeup remover ever. I'm saying \"I do\" and living happily ever after. The end.",
