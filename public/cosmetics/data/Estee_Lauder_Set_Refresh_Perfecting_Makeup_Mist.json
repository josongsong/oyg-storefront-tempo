        "comments": "This waa recommended by an Ulta makeup consultant while trying foundations. I actually already had a setting spray that I've used for years, but followed her suggestion as something new. So glad I did! Estee Lauder is certainly one of the cosmetic/skin care OG's, and this spray is awesome! Because I'm in my 50's, not all makeup products work well with my mature skin (Combination skin-more dry, with some sensitivity). This setting spray gives me such a natural, dewy glow, and really enhances my makeup application. I even notice a plumping effect when I wear it. I've had it for 6 months now, and have even tried others to compare my results-still the most hydrating setting spray in my cabinet. It is worth the splurge-I will repurchase.",

I also tried supergoop and Milk, but those left me feeling oily and slick. This is a happy medium that provides make up with a boost to keep it looking fresh throughout the day but doesn't give a dry/tight/cakey feeling or appearance. \nI will say that I work in healthcare and I do wear a mask and find that when I wear this my make up lasts a lot longer at work. It is similar to the Iliah setting mist but you get almost twice the product for $3 more!! I know some people want make up to last a very long time and through sweat, working out, a long day at a hot beach, etc. and I don't know if this has the power and capacity to truly keep your makeup flawless for 20 hours like some other options. But for everyday use it is fabulous!",

I also tried supergoop and Milk, but those left me feeling oily and slick. This is a happy medium that provides make up with a boost to keep it looking fresh throughout the day but doesn't give a dry/tight/cakey feeling or appearance. \nI will say that I work in healthcare and I do wear a mask and find that when I wear this my make up lasts a lot longer at work. It is similar to the Iliah setting mist but you get almost twice the product for $3 more!! I know some people want make up to last a very long time and through sweat, working out, a long day at a hot beach, etc. and I don't know if this has the power and capacity to truly keep your makeup flawless for 20 hours like some other options. But for everyday use it is fabulous!",
