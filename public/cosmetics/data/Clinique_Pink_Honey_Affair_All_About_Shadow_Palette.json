A few of the shades have a nice satin finish, but for the most part they are not buildable, are very hard pressed and difficult to put on a brush or sponge, some shades are almost dupes of one another, go ashy when applied, and colors are not true to pan (are much more sheer). I depotted the pans and kept about half of them.",

Whether it's a busy workday or a night out, these shadows stay put, maintaining their beauty for hours on end.\n\nPackaging and Presentation: Housed in a sleek, portable compact, the palette is as stylish as it is practical. The included mirror and applicator make it easy to create your perfect look on the go.\n\nSkin-Friendly Ingredients: True to Clinique's commitment to skin health, the Black Honey palette is ophthalmologist-tested and safe for sensitive eyes.

That was the only reason I purchased this product, and I was very disappointed.  I tried to resolve the issue using live chat and spent an hour and forty minutes texting three different people to only find out that the website is wrong.  To Clinique's credit, they did give me a refund, but only after an additional thirty-minute phone call for a grand total of two hours of my time. For this reason only I went with 2 stars instead of 1.  This is definitely not worth the money without the applicator shown and described here on this website.  It is false advertisement.  If you purchase this set, please know that you will not get an eyeshadow brush.  BRING BACK THE BRUSH CLINIQUE.  I am not the only one with this issue.",
