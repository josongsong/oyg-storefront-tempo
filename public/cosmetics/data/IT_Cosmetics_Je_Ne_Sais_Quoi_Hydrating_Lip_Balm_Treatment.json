It gets two stars because it isn't a BAD product per se, but it is definitely not worth the price. I prefer my burts bees balms. better colors, better nourishment for the lips, and better price. For reference, I bought the Honey shade and it immediately turns into a hot pink on the lips instead of a nice dusty color like the swatch shows.",

It was terrible when I couldn't find it in stores. \n\nI've had probably 2 dozen tubes of it delivered or bought in store, all of the colors at one point or another, but I tend to go to for Perfect Pink since it's the least color and more like a true clear lip balm with a slight tint on me. The others are good for when you want a \"my lip color but better\" look. I have double lined lips though, so I have to be careful of how I tap my lips together, or it goes too low. Perfect Pink is less visible, so I don't have to be as careful with it. \n\nPlease do not ever get rid of this product. It's the most moisturizing, longest lasting, prettiest balm ever. You can feel that it's on your lips, but in a good way. You know it's there and working. It doesn't instantly dry out like other balms who just want you to use as much product as possible to then buy more. \n\nThis is the one.",

I wanted this one to work but after months of using it daily I had to admit it wasn't doing what it is supposed to do. For dry chapped lips or as a lipstick primer I've had better results from using Confidence In A Cream, Vitality Lip Flushes, and lip balms from other companies. This has no color or fragrance but that's not why I purchased it. No SPF either. It just doesn't make lips feel great nor does it feel like it absorbs much. The Vitality Lip Flush in the same color is better in my opinion.",
