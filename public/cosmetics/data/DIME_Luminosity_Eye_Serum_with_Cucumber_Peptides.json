        "comments": "Bought this on sale. For that reason I'll keep using it -- the ingredients are wonderfully nourishing and the cold application feels wonderful in the morning because of the metal tip. If it were full price I probably would've returned it though. I just don't feel it accomplishes what it claims as far as dark circles and de-puffing, at least in my case. The photos show before, immediately after, and 30 mins after. I didn't see any significant reduction in puffiness. Although there's no magic product that will keep you from looking tired if you're tired, this didn't give me as much of a boost I was looking for to justify the price. The skin did feel soft, luminous, and super moisturized -- good product in that regard.",
