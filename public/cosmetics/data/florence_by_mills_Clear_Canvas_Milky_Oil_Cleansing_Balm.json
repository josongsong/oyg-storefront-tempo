        "comments": "I love this cleansing balm! It's the only makeup remover that does not get into my eyes and cause everything to look blurry for the next half hour. It works really well in combination with a microfiber cloth and removes all of my mascara and eyeliner. It has a nice herbal scent that washes away with the product, so you only smell it while using it (which I prefer since I have slightly sensitive skin). Overall this is a nice solid first step in a double cleanse.",

        "comments": "I love a lot of Florence products and bought this hoping to be able to skip a step in my routine. I don't have a problem with the packaging, I think being able to squeeze it on your hands or cotton pad is convenient and had no issues. My main issue is that the product is SO greasy! It makes my face feel oily instantly and it does not wash off easily. You are left with a thick, oily residue on your face and you are just wiping around your makeup or sunscreen making it worse and harder to remove from the eyes and other areas. I have to use several cotton pads/squares and then add in some micellar water and it takes way too long to remove. So definitely did not save on time and actually added a step. If using in the shower maybe it would be easier, but that's not what I was looking for. Clean-it and other products offer the same results without that heavy greasy feeling like vasoline on your face. I would not recommend.",

This product is incredibly effective at removing makeup and impurities without stripping my skin of its natural oils. The balm-to-oil texture melts away even the most stubborn waterproof makeup effortlessly.\nWhat I LOVE most about this cleansing balm is how gentle it is on my skin. It leaves my face feeling soft, hydrated, and perfectly prepped for the next steps in my skincare regimen.\nPlus, the subtle, pleasant scent adds a touch of spa-like relaxation to my evening routine. Overall, the Clear Canvas Milky Oil Cleansing Balm is a must-have for anyone looking for a thorough yet gentle cleansing experience. Highly recommend!",

        "comments": "First and foremost to disclose I was given this product to be part of the Fall #FlorencePanel. That being said this is my first time being sent a free product to try and based off of what I have seen I was really anxious. My skin is very temperamental combination skin. I previously have used CeraVe after about a decade of not having anything work. It worked but in the last year I wanted to try something else. I currently use the rose water spray and the clear the way products by Florence By Mills. That being said this is all new for me but I adore it. More importantly the Clear Canvas Milky Oil Cleansing Balm. It not only leaves my skin feeling hydrated and refreshed but does not leave me with a dry feeling after or an oily one  which I often have no matter what product I use. The only downside is I am not the biggest fan of not having caps since I share a bathroom with my husband and he has his own skin care and we are avid tattoo getters so we sometimes have peelies on our counter from healing tattoos. But the product itself was fantastic, it also resulted in my skin feeling softer and generally less irritated. I have also been struggling with clearing one side of my face and within three days my skin had cleared up with this product. ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS. It removed my work makeup and costuming makeup incredibly well. I would say absolutely try it if you struggle with skin care like I do. Also, it smells absolutely INCREDIBLE.",

        "comments": "I love a lot of Florence products and bought this hoping to be able to skip a step in my routine. I don't have a problem with the packaging, I think being able to squeeze it on your hands or cotton pad is convenient and had no issues. My main issue is that the product is SO greasy! It makes my face feel oily instantly and it does not wash off easily. You are left with a thick, oily residue on your face and you are just wiping around your makeup or sunscreen making it worse and harder to remove from the eyes and other areas. I have to use several cotton pads/squares and then add in some micellar water and it takes way too long to remove. So definitely did not save on time and actually added a step. If using in the shower maybe it would be easier, but that's not what I was looking for. Clean-it and other products offer the same results without that heavy greasy feeling like vasoline on your face. I would not recommend.",
