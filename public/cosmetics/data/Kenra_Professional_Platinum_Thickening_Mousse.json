        "comments": "My hair is very wiry, thin, brittle, and prone to breakage. Left completely natural, it looks like worn out steel wool that has started to unravel, feels like very thin straw, and seems to shed more than my corgi in summer. When flat ironed without product, it kind of just lays flat with no movement. So naturally, I've decided to try and grow it out shoulder length. My reviews are based on how products have helped or hindered that effort, and may not be applicable to your hair type. I started out using this daily, with the root lifting spray, then blow drying, followed by a flat iron. While it certainly did add volume, my hair ended up feeling stiff and brittle and seemed to result in excess breakage. I've had better luck bypassing the mousse stage. I do still use this on occasion when I don't feel like breaking out the flat iron, and it does provide volume and help control my unruly curl . However, I rarely use it because I do notice more breakage after using it and my hair feels more brittle the next day.  So beware if you have dry or brittle hair.",

I have thick hair and this helps lift my roots because my long hair tends the flatten on top due to the heavy weight of my ends. Gives you a thick look all over.

I found this weighed my hair down, did not really make it thicker, but I gave it at least 2 stars because it does seem to give lift at the scalp, for those that desire that, with the use of a blow dryer and round brush. However, I don't like lift because it just ends up showing too much scalp through the lifted hair. Sigh :-(      Now...Kenra's blow dry MIST (not just spray, but the mist) is spectacular for protecting fragile hair from curling iron! So maybe try that if you have hair like mine. Hope this helps.",
