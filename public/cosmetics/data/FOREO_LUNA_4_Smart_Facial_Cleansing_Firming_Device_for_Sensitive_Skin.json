It most definitely makes a difference and even gets stuff out of my pores, but I'm still getting used to the massage side (think it helps with puffiness). Overall, I'm really happy I got it and I'll never go back to anything else",

The brush is incredibly soft, but it still does the job—cleansing away all impurities. It's also super easy to clean, which is important to me. I love the pulsations; they're so relaxing.

Over a period of one month, my complexion cleared out (I wasn't aware that not every brush is this hygienic). It is worth every penny for sure",

Super gentle easy to use and removes all the excess oil and dirt from my face. I use with or without app, super travel friendly and compatible. After each use my skin always feels really firm and soft and my breakouts happen way less. Great investment and will always be a part of skincare routine.",
