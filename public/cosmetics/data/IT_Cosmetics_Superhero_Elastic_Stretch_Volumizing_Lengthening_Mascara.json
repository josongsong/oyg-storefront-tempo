But this is so worth the splurge and I try to get it when it's on sale. \n\nIt makes my lashes look SO long and they hold their curl all day. My biggest problem with mascaras is they look good for about an hour and then they fall flat, but this doesn't do that. Also, looks great immediately after opening, you don't have to dry it out for a few days. Can't recommend enough!",
