I have eczema and generally dryer skin, plus my skin is thinning a bit more so it gets that crepe feel. This goes on smooth, you can use your finger easily, or a small brush, I wouldn't use the foam things. You can layer a little if you need more coverage in certain areas. It blends and does not cake, if it does, you can smooth it out with your finger again. Love it so much!",

I had hoped Benefit's Cakeless Concealer would be the answer, however the worst quality of it was that it caked excessively. I really tried, in fact I used it on a clean moisturized face four times. I only wanted to cover a little discoloration and give a fresher appearance under my eyes. Fortunately, I don't have bags under my eyes to contend with. I quickly learned that less is better with this product. However in my attempt to blend and/or build the concealer the result was very \"cakey\". I think Benefit needs to change the name and claim of this concealer! Too bad too, because I love their other products and I had such high hopes.",

          "caption": "Thank you @influenster  for sending me the new Boi~ing cakeless concealer from @benefitcosmetics for review. I received the shade number 4, and let me start of by saying the packaging is super cute! Shaped like a pencil ✏️ which was way cute! The formula was lightweight and thin but had a soft feel to the skin. The applicator was just as amazing because it's easy to glide and a little goes a long way. I really liked how smooth the product applied and how easily it blended into my skin. I had no issues with blending or creasing. I also used a setting powder to help with creasing. It definitely was not cakey nor runny. \n#boiing #influenster #influenstervoxbox #voxbox #benefitcosmetics #cakelessconcealer #cakeless #concealer  #beauty #beautybloggers #beautytips #beautyreview #bblogger #influencer #makeup #makeuplife #makeuptips #makeupinfluencer #bloggerlife #instalove #instamakeup #instaphoto #instapic #influencermarketing #benefitbeauty #beautybloggers",

        "comments": "First Impressions -\n\nAnyway, overall I would say I really like this concealer. I try to avoid things like this because of my sensitive/oily skin type, but by far this has been living up to my expectations.\n\nFirst of all, it came in a very pretty and light-colored packaging and the item itself had a very cute design. It has the design of a medium-sized pencil and the main frame is glass with black writing on the front. Its very simple, but cute.\n\n Inspecting & Applying - \n\nNow, when opened, it doesn't have a strong nor offending smell. Its very faint, which is a go to when you are not looking for one laced with chemicals.\n\n As for the concealer itself, it has a slight thicker texture than other concealers I have used. Yet, with the cushion tip, it made it quite easy to apply it despite this. It smoothed out very easily and blended very evenly. \n\nThough, at first do to its color, I mostly used it around my eyes as a test. But, it passed very efficiently at hiding my dark circles and unevenness around my eyes. So, only after then, I used it as a full coverage concealer. In which, it did even better. It hid my dark spots and my blemishes quite effectively with an overall smooth finish. So, I absolutely love the option of both coverage options.\n\nThis product's NO.10, kinda reminds me of M·A·C Pro Longwear Concealer NC45, but comparably better in feel & quality.\n\nIt overall looked amazing. It also felt good on my skin and blended well with other makeup. I didn't have any allergic reactions when using and my oily skin didn't disrupt the concealer too much. It felt very lightweight on my skin and it did live up to its claims of not caking. It stayed on evenly and lasted me quite long throughout the day. \n\nI have yet to try out its waterproof compatiblities, but it lives up well to its others. So, by far, I haven't had any issues, but this is a wonderful concealer I was very excited to try and I am very glad I did. \nI received this product complimentary for test and review.",

        "comments": "I received this product for free from Benefit (through an app which I am not able to log into on my cell phone or tablet so I am writing it here on my PC) as part of a contest and I couldn't wait to test it out and wear it; however I found that some of the claims such as the waterproof were not so accurate. \nI was easily able to wash the concealer off without any soap and while the application wasn't cakey to begin with the longer I wore it the heavier my face began to feel and the feeling that my skin wasn't getting any air was very noticeable. \nI also found that this was not as full coverage as some other brands that I have used in the past. The coverage when blended out looked streaky / splotchy on my face against the foundations I tried it with. I am pretty sure it pulled up the drug store foundation when I tested it out.\nThe cushion tip seemed to hold onto the product well, but when swiped barely anything came off the applicator onto my skin.\nFinally the shade range seems a little limited with only 12 shades to choose from, I am a little bummed out there.\nThe packaging is very cute as the unicarton is definately some aesthetically pleasing colors. I found the pencil eraser tip to be very adorable on the product itself and it was very light weight all around. It's small and easily tossed into a makeup bag or kit and taken when you're on the go.\n\nFor the price I would say it's a fair deal and I know not all shades have the same formula as different undertones and shades require different mixes of ingredients. But I am disappointed in the product after having waited so eagerly to test it out and wear it for the first time. \nAgain I did receive this product for free in a contest from Benefit through an app.",
