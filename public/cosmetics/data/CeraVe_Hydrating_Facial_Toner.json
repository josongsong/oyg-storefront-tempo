It is also nice that it is fragrance free and pH balanced. After just one use, it made my skin look so healthy that it was glowing! I definitely will buy this product and highly recommend to anyone, especially people with dry skin. It is quite impressive how hydrating this product is without clogging the pores or leaving a greasy residue. It has also really calmed my skin, which was slightly irritated from climate dryness. Try it, you will absolutely love it and wonder how you've gone so long without it!",

        "comments": "I am skeptical of fully depending on wipes when it comes to cleaning, but I decided to give it a try. But of course, I follow with micellar water, water-based foam cleanser and toner.  \nIt effectively cleanses my makeup, but I should note that I only use tinter sunscreen on a daily basis. It is also easy to use and my skin feels cleaner and there is less dirt left on the cleansing pad afterwards.  \nWipe thickness is perfect for single use and not very thin but not sturdy and durable. The size is quite big, but really enough for one face.  \nIt did not make my skin dry or irritated as I was afraid of.  \nLove that it is biodegradable. \nI did not use mascara or eyeliner, so I can't say something about them. Even if I used them, I would never use wipes to remove them.  \nOverall, such facial wipes are suitable and convenient when traveling and when you really want to feel super clean.  \nMay purchase one when I need additional cleaning product while travelling",
