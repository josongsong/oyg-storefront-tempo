It looked exactly like the time I sat in the sun all day every day for two weeks straight in Hawaii when I was 15 years old. Quite a nasty sunburn but this one didn't hurt. The nurses told me to use Aquaphor, but 3 days of Aquaphor did nothing at all, so I bought this hoping it would do something better than nothing. I slept with it overnight and the morning after it was half as red and looking really good. I now have a newfound respect for Oatmeal as an active ingredient.",

        "comments": "Let me just say, I have used a lot of different moisturizers. Out of all of the ones I've tried so far, this is the best. I have sensitive skin and don't usually struggle with bad acne, but I'm prone to break outs and flaky, dry skin (especially during the fall & winter months). So I've started using this and it actually works! It has totally helped to calm my breakouts and any redness I struggle with and has helped my skin feel smoother, gives it a glow, and just look better overall. It actually does what a moisturizer is supposed to do - moisturize!! It's very thick and feels a little wet and watery when you first apply. But after it dries, my skin literally feels so soft and stays moist all day long. I love it! And the fact that it's actually created to be safe for sensitive skin is a huge bonus for me and is exactly what I look for in skincare products. For those of you with sensitive skin who are looking for a great moisturizer, I highly recommend!",

No product seemed to be helping this year until I decided to give First Aid Beauty a try. I remember Hyram talking about using them if your skin was really dry and that it wouldn't break you out. So I thought why not because you've tried everything else it seems.\n\nThis product is on the pricey side  however, my dry patches are gone and my face is well moisturized but not overly oily/greasy. My skin responds really well to this product and will continue to use it through the winter season. I don't mind spending a little more for a product that really works, I say it's worth the price.\n\nI really recommend this product to anyone who is having dry skin issues; dry patches, eczema, etc.",

Looking at the ingredients, i was mortified to see more warnings about the use of this wonder cream. Dont get it in your eyes, keep away from children and so on. My husband is a disabled veteran and his back is always dry and irritated. I applied the cream and a few minutes later, he told me his skin feels dry and was painfully red. I washed his back asap and applied his proven good treatment oil and cream. Since i bought only the travel size, i will put it in the trash. This cream is by far not recommended for sensitive skin, individual with serious skin issues. The smell of menthol is the first indication, something is off. Lesson learned and i stay with clean cosmetics!",
