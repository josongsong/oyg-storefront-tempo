Otherwise it is hydrating and doesn't dry out my skin, while exfoliating and smoothing, so I really like that. The aha chemical exfoliation seems to be doing the trick in exfoliating the dead skin, so I don't know why they feel they must put a gritty texture in it. That's the only problem I have with it. Otherwise it makes my skin feel great.  Again it isn't drying yet exfoliates your skin. But it has little granules in it. Please Neutrogena - remove the granules.",

I have used harsh products on my face due to cystic acne my whole life, but I have never used a product that has caused such a reaction.  Do not use this even if you have the worst skin. There are better products out there that are a little more pricy but will not cause such a reaction.",

While these are outlawed in many areas, I feel as if they are still on the shelves, and it is a concern that I may inadvertently be purchasing them.  So kudos to Neutrogena for perhaps stating the obvious, but something that needed to be stated nonetheless.  I was pleased with the cleansing properties of the product, and found the exfoliating particles to be a perfect size- not too large or small, and not too abrasive.  Overall I'm pleased with this product, as it seemed gentle enough to cleanse without being harsh, but also worked as an exfoliator.",
