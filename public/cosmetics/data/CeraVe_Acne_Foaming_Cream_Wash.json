It doesn't matter how much moisturizer you put on. You could use the whole bottle and the dryness and itch would still be there. It might just be too strong for me but if you were considering the stronger basic medicated face wash, stick with the 4%. I would never use this one again. The cream does not foam or smell and feels like I'm wiping toothpaste on my face. They really need to get the foaming together on both.",

This cleared it up within a week or two and I've never broken out there again! Now this past week I was a little too excessive wjth a lip product and had a few small whiteheads on my upper lip line and they're all dried up within a few days! I don't really break out so it's great to have this on the shelf if/when I need jt. I know the 10% BP looks scary because its so high strength but honestly it only caused minimum redness/a little bit of dryness. Nothing crazy; nothing that didnt' clear up within a week or so.",

It hasn't completely stopped my acne, but it is worlds better than what it was. I use it in the morning and before bed. I don't have sensitive skin, but this wash seems pretty gentle. It hasn't dried me out, but I do always apply moisturizer after washing. Just super grateful to have found something that helps.",

I use it consistently with a salicylic acid spot treatment and my acne is practically gone. I DO NOT recommend doing that if you have sensitive skin. Mine is very average \"normal\" The 10% doesnt dry me out or cause irritation. The only annoying thing is if you don't get it 100% off after, you can bleach your clothing. Make sure you rinse really well all over and use a towel you don't care about just in case. Once I rinsed more thoroughly, I didnt have that issue.",

I like to let it sit for 4 minutes or so like a mask. It really helps with acne. It's also my secret ingredient for dermaplaning without breaking out. I use it before I dermaplane and after to help keep any acne bacteria from getting pushed around. 10/10.",

        "comments": "CeraVe Acne Foaming Cream Wash does its job exactly as advertised. It is easy to use, and effective. It does not have any harsh odor and it is not irritating at all. The cream is a smooth, easy to use product. The product is a great size at 5 fluid ounces and lathers very well. I have used it in the shower as a full body wash and at the sink as part of my daily skincare routine. What I like about it is the 10% Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Treatment really makes me feel like I am cleaning out my pores and helping my body fight acne. I would want you to know to be sure you wear sunscreen while using this product. It is the best thing you can do to be sure you don't sunburn. I be sure to use this in conjunction with my daily skincare routine and moisturize completely to ensure my skin is in the best condition. Compared to similar products I have used this is a strong product with strong results. I would buy this product for myself or others looking for an easy to use, easy to buy effective acne treatment product. I think finding the right product for you is an important step to make sure you use it multiple times a day, as directed. I would recommend my family and friends try this product if they're looking for an effective acne foaming cream wash. All in all it has been great and I'm happy to continue to use it.I love that the box is recyclable and that the product is made in the US. I also love that there is a very clearly printed expiration date with a long timeline before product expiration.",

I bought this product to help with acne and followed the directions exactly how it was stated to help get rid of my acne and it made it 100 times worse. I should have stopped using it right away but kept using because I wanted to get past the \"purging\" stage. Please use my experience and do not use this product. Your skin will be better off without this product. I have now spent hundreds of dollars to get rid of the damages that were left by this product and I still don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. What this product has done to my face and my confidence is sad.",
