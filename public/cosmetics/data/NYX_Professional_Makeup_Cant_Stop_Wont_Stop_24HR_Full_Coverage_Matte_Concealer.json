For reference, most concealers I've used (maybelline FitMe or efl camo) have .20 oz, and many have .30 oz (like colourpop). With the amount you're given for just under $10, the price isn't really more affordable than higher end brands that charge $30 for .30 oz.\nExtremely disapointing",

You can't see anything (undereye bags, scars, discoloration) under it, and it's really creamy, but on the other hand, the finish is matte. Personally, I prefer my base to be more on the dewy side. Even though it's matte, it doesn't crease or anything, and it stays on all day. If you like matte concealers, this one will be perfect for you!",
