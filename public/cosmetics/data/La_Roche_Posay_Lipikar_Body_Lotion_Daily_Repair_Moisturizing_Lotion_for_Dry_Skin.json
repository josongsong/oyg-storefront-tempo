I have relatively dry skin, I've only used this about 4 times now, but so far it seems to really moisturize, I've experienced no irritation or breakouts. So i'm really excited about this, and i hope it continues to work for me because this could be my new staple! It feels a little thick and sticky in a way at first, but i find it absorbs very quickly and doesn't leave a heavy residue on the face. though still obvious it's there. Also the smell is pretty awful, it just smells weird, not strong, not fragrant, just not a good smell. But i can overlook it if the product does what it's meant to.",
