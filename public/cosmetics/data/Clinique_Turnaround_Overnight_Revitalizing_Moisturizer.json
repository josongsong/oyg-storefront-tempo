However, despite the flare up in acne, it didn't even my complexion and brighten my skin. But to me, the added acne (on top of the acne I already had) wasn't worth it, so I tossed the product. Recently, I was put on accutane and have very sensitive (sometimes to the point of being red from irritation), combination skin (my t-zone remains oily, but I still have very dry skin at the same time) and I decided to give this another shot. Now that I have sensitive skin thats more on the dry-combo side, this doesn't clog my pores anymore or cause breakouts, and gives me that \"I got a full 8 hours of sleep last night\", natural looking, dewy, moisturized glow.\nAll in all, this product does what it says it does, but don't get this if you expect a deep moisture cream. I'd give it an 8.5/10 on moisture, so if you are looking for a deep moisturizing night cream and dryness is your one and only concern, you will need something else with this. Be mindful of your skin type! I would recommend this to people with combination to very dry skin, not oily people.",
