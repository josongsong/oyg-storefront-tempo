I would say Kiss me more is a bit lighter than I expected but still pretty for a peachy nude day.",

I hate glosses, they are too thick and sticky for me and I just don't feel like I have much control over how my lips look after I apply it, and always feel like I have to keep checking how it looks. This is a liquid balm, in the cutest shade of pink, with a delicious vanilla scent, and looks and stays absolutely beautiful. I always use balms and this just takes it to the next natural level with cute color and a nice shine. Once applied, the thick texture disappears and just lays down perfectly on the lips giving a nice plumped look. I bought this with my own money and i am so excited to keep using this theough the spring and summer! Highly recommend!! Good job Dibs!!",

It makes it hard to pull out and put back in the applicator and the color can look a bit patchy when you rub your lips together. You can see in the photo that the gloss is so thick, it stays in this stiff chunk on the applicator. Wondering if the thick formula is normal or if I got a bad batch?",
