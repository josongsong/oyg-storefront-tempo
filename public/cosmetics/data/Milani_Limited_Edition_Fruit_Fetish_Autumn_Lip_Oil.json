The cocoa one this year smells just like chocolate and has a beautiful fallish brownish color! The candy apple one taste delicious like the name with a light reddish,pink color!

        "comments": "This is a true sheer black with no other color based added to it, (no red, no purple) so it'll apply really well on naturally red or pink lips and give them a dark vampy tint, which is beautiful! But, the applicator itself is very stiff with very little flocking, which means it'll feel like you're using hard plastic to apply the product. The product also doesn't evacuate the tube evenly on the foot of the brush making the application patchy. So, good color, smooth formula, bad applicator. Try using your finger instead if the brush doesn't work!",

It does not really make my lips feel hydrated as expected. The brush is not fully covered when taken out of the bottle so have to dip multiple times.",
