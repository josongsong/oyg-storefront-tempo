As a step before putting on the dew cream. To freshen my makeup. To soothe my scalp. To refresh my face. To smell good. To hydrate my hands and feet. I bought the 3 bottle set. Each has a light and not overwhelming scent. This didn't irritate my skin. Money not wasted after all.",

My favorite was the green with the aloe, cucumber, & green tea. It was very awakening, refreshing, & smelled a very light nice fresh scent. Also the purple one is very good too! They both hydrate your skin very much & give you \"that glow\". Would definetly purchase this product again.",

Unfortunately, my sensitive skin did not take very well to this spray. I ended up with an allergic reaction after applying it. I would say to take my review with a grain of salt. I have very sensitive skin that reacts to many ingredients commonly found in skincare and makeup so if you don't have finicky skin like mine, you will most likely love this.",
