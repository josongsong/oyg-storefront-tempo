I want to start off by saying I have been a regular user of Estee Lauder skincare products and am quite happy with their product line. \nI was excited to try this new product. Plus for having the SPF 25. I'm 35 so I am actively working on anti aging and wrinkle reducers.  So I put this on after I cleansed and toned in the morning. The packaging is nice. It looks luxurious and it feels the same as well. Love the scent and feel of it on my face. I also applied it to my neck area, anywhere that would get sun exposure. I then continued on with my makeup. I like that there's no whitecast. Obviously this is for daytime use only so this amount can last you quite a bit of time. It's also oil free which also helps it not feel \"sticky\" which I hate. The moringa extract as an ingredient is interesting to me. I think it's the first product I've used that contains that! But I've heard good things regarding antioxidants and what not. I will continue using this in my morning routine. She's a keeper.\nGifted by esteelauder",

        "comments": "I recently tried the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme with SPF 25, but ultimately, I decided it wasn't the right fit for my skincare regimen. While the cream itself is pleasant to use, with a luxurious feel that Estée Lauder is known for, I didn't find it meeting all my specific needs.\n\nIn terms of benefits, I did notice some firmness in my facial skin after use, which speaks to the product's quality and effectiveness in some areas. However, the main issue I was hoping to address - reducing the appearance of neck lines, partly due to PCOS - saw no noticeable improvement. This was a bit disappointing, given my high hopes for such a reputable brand.\n\nI chose to stop using the product as it didn't align well with my skincare goals. However, recognizing its potential benefits for other skin concerns, I passed it on to my mom. Her skin concerns align more closely with what this moisturizer promises to tackle, and I believe it will be a better match for her needs.\n\nWhile this moisturizer may not have been a perfect match for me, it could certainly be a valuable addition to someone else's skincare routine, especially for those looking to improve skin firmness and enjoy the added protection of SPF. * gifted by Estée Lauder *",
