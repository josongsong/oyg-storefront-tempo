        "comments": "I have severe acne prone/ hormonal skin. i have acne scars, active acne, really un even skin tone,  skin texture, and i am really insecure about it. I've probably been using this foundation since i was 17 and i am 20 years old now. I have switched back and fourth between high end brands and drug store brands nothing else preforms and blends and covers better then this foundation for me. I want to mention that i have practiced the art of covering up my acne for awhile so in my own opinion i think i am really bomb at my OWN makeup routine and i have learned how to apply foundation the way my skin needs it to be applied and not everyone is going to be the same. I apply foundation with a brush, it has way more coverage and does not take the foundation with it like a beauty blender would. I used to use a beauty blender when i had clear skin it still preformed seamlessly for me but with having acne and all that a beauty blender is actually my worst enemy. I also want to add, i color correct my face like crazy so i think thats also why my foundation looks amazing once applied. I do have combo skin and all i use to prep is a moisturizer and sunscreen. thats it. I don't get active breakouts from this foundation. my top 3 reasons why i use this and always will unless my skin starts to clear up anytime soon. I highly recommend this if you have skin problems like me ! only thing i hate obviously is that there is no pump. I wish they would add that but other then that this is the best for me!!",

All the women in my family use it and it's a wonderful product. \r\n\r\nHowever,  when I purchased the product this month I was a little concerned about the pigment of the 110. It had more yellow undertones than the previous month. This works out because my skin happens to be kind of olive but definitely concerned me. I attached the swatches and the bottles to prove they are the same. The left is the new bottle and right is the old. When the foundation is exposed to oxygen does it lose pigment? \r\n\r\nThis won't keep me from buying the product in the future and still love what I've got! It just was noticeably different.",

The first time I applied it, it was beautiful, so matte so perfect. I went out and got oily as expected but great. The second time and third time and fourth time, it felt heavy, felt cakey, it oxidized HARD, which I saw coming but it was to a point that I felt like an Oompa Loompa after the first time. Idk maybe I got a bad one because my bestfriend still loves her, but for me being real oil skin and having lots of pores I was a sucker for this one and I loved it, THE FIRST time. But then idk fell flat. Maybe it was one bottle",
