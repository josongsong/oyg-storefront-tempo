It does the job of gently exfoliating my face, but leaves it feeling smooth after. After a few uses I have not had any irritation (I have sensitive skin) so that is a win! It is a bit pricey in my opinion, but it will last you quite a while so that kinda balances it out.",

After searching for a few weeks trying to find a new product that would be more pleasant on my skin, the skincare specialist at Ulta showed this cleanser scrub to me.\nI was skeptical at first but gave it a try. I have been using it for 4 days now. It doesn't irritate my skin at all, feels very soothing, feels gentle on my acne spots, makes my skin feel very smooth, does not dry me out, and is helping to clear my blemishes. It is great for daily use, I use it both in the morning and the evening with no issues.",

Sadly this just doesn't do it for me. The granules in it that are suppose to exfoliate the skin are way to big,few and far between, and just rolls around on your skin. I do not feel like I am getting any dead skin off or exfoliating at all. It's more like a massage. Also, the cleanser itself is so thick and heavy, I feel as if I really have to rub my face a little harder than normal to rinse it all off during the rinsing process. Also doesn't lather so I don't really know why it's called a cleanser. There's been no change for the better or the worse after using this, so I don't see myself repurchasing in the future. If it didn't cost so much I wouldn't even finish it, however I can't bring myself to throw away money. I recommend looking elsewhere for a good exfoliator.",

That being said, I still think the ingredient list is too long.\n\nThe product has a thin yet creamy texture.
