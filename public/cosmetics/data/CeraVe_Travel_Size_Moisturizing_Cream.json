This is the only moisturizer I have ever found that doesn't produce these results. It is also very cheap - lots of bang for your buck. It washes off and absorbs into the skin well. You don't need to use much to cover the whole face - about half a teaspoon if I were to estimate. I like to put a little extra on at night to let it soak in - I have found this method hydrates my skin well and prevents my acne treatments from irritating my skin.",

When I realized that wasn't the case, I was worried to put it on my face because I have oily, acne prone skin and didn't want to exacerbate the condition. However, I applied it anyway and was pleasantly surprised how much my skin improved. My skin has become less textured, my breakouts have decreased, and the redness has significantly subsided. I also find that my skin is less oily than it was when I was using a gel moisturizer marketed for oily skin. \n\nThis Cerave container is also very large when used only on the face, so I suspect I'll have this for over 6 months when used once a day. I have used dozens of facial moisturizers over the years (gel, lotion, acne-fighting, thick cream, etc.) and this was has beat them all, including my previous high-end Korean brand. I will definitely repurchase this when I run out.\n\n**Small suggestion: I recommend you purchase the Moisturizing Cream that comes with the pump. I find half a pump to be more than enough for my whole face. The pump stops me from accidentally using too much product, plus it's more hygienic this way.",

I have old jars that list all the good ingredient like their ceramides, cholesterol, and hyaluronic acid above petrolatum. Now, they're listed below potassium phosphate, which is just an ingredient to adjust pH, so basically there's next to none of the good stuff now for the same price. Now the hyaluronic acid is so low that it doesn't even do anything, it's just there for their marketing. Such a disappointing change, DO NOT BUY.",
