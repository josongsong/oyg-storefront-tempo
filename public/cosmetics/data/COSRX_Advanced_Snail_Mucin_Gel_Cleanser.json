        "comments": "I use the COSRX Snail Mucin Cleanser, Power Essence Serum, Eye Cream, and All In One Cream, combined with a Mario Badescu toner and a multitude of The Ordinary treatments to form a personalized and highly effective skin care regimen that has made my skin look and feel tighter, firmer, healthier, and younger. On days when I'm in a rush, the Snail Mucin line is my go-to and is effective on its own, but combined with a few Ordinary products, it's the most amazing skin care regimen I have ever used. This is the best cleanser I have used since the Arbonne RE9 line which is very expensive and difficult to find. I was very skeptical at first, but I've been thrilled with this cleanser, and it only takes a tiny bit and lasts forever.",

I use this after the micellar water from the same brand and it works wonders without stripping the skin.",

I've been using Missha super aqua cell renew snail cleanser for years and it's my favorite affordable hydrating cleanser. I won't be returning the Cosrx, but I doubt I will repurchase, solely because it smells like cheap dish soap to me and is unpleasant to use. It works fine, leaves my skin feeling hydrating and clean, but the smell is just off-putting for me and cheapens it. Pros: texture, hydration, lather, and no allergic reaction. Cons: price and smell",

If you can get past the snail mucin part, it is a very gel like product and smooths on your skin which makes it feel moisturizing as it dissolves your makeup.  It also has a pleasing odor.  The price point is also great for how much product you get and it takes very little to take off your makeup (and I wear a lot of product).",

I will continue to buy this product for the foreseeable future. It is first a gel-type consistency but when you lather it up it becomes a bit foamy. I really like it for both my morning and night routine. This is something I would use all the time and it is really affordable! I am really glad Ulta has this product available to grab and go. People have been hyping this brand up so definitely been stocking up with these products. I like to have two of these products on hand. 1) I am currently using and 2) is the one I will use once I'm finished with the other bottle. So I know I will never run out of a cleanser for my skincare routine.",

        "comments": "I love the Snail 92 cream and several other toners and essences from CosRX, but never tried out the cleanser, and as I needed to cleanse my face more often this season and begin a morning cleanse I thought this would be perfect to try out for both times of day.\nThe fragrance is beautiful and feels so clean, and the texture is a viscous gel like formula, and just needs to be mixed with a little water to begin turning into a nice hydrating foamy lather (not a drying or undetectably light airy foam) which feels great to spread around the face and neck. I felt like this was really going to clear my skin because of how nicely it felt like it spread on the skin.\nUnfortunately this is not actually good at its one job - cleaning the skin. I have tried using an oil cleanser before this cleanser, going in 3 times with this cleanser, and even tried leaving it on for several minutes  - but nothing makes this cleanser actually able to remove every bit of makeup on the eyes and skin. You see the foundation dripping from the skin each rinse, and the skin becomes oily feeling each rinse in the process as it just cannot grab onto and clear makeup as well as it needs to.\nEvery time I have tried using this after wearing makeup, I cannot get every last bit of lipstick, foundation, eyeliner, or mascara off, nor a tinted SPF which is not supposed to even be a long lasting product. I cannot rely on this to take off the day even when I am makeup free as I need to guarantee every active on my skin is coming off before I go in with my other skin products.\nEvery time I used this, my skin didn't feel perfectly cleaned and cleared, it just wasn't leaving it as refreshed as my best cleansers do, even if my skin felt really soft after. My skin didn't show any signs of looking irritated when using this so I don't think the fragrance is bad for people with sensitive and acne prone skin. But I am going to be setting this aside to only be used as a morning cleanser after days I did not wear makeup the day before until I simply decide I don't want it anymore and throw it out. I can't gift this to anyone who wears makeup either as this is useless for them too.\nI like enough products by this brand that I don't think I will stop using anything else I've enjoyed by them because of this, but as this is the 2nd product I do not enjoy by them, I will just be sticking to what I like rather than try to experiment with anything else now.",
