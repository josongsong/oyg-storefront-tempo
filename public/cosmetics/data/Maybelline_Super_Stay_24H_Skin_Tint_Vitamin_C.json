I even use this on a full beat look and its fantastic. Seriously do not have one bad thing to say on it.",

Ita not thin on application like a skin tint usually is, but instead has really good coverage, without feeling cakey or thick- i got two shades so i have a winter color and summer color and i love them all. I go back ans forth between this and a standard foundation and always go right back to using this no mather the circumstances because it gives me whatever type of coverage i want. I have acne prone skin & this still covers acne with no issues for me! Probably my favorite yet!",

It has great coverage for how light it is, more than any skin tint I own and it doesnt slip around or disappear completely with blending. With an additional dab on my redder areas I can easily layer for fuller coverage. \n\nI have combo skin and it works well with my dry skin on my nose and surrounding area, I only need a hydrating primer when I'm especially dry. Usually I don't use a primer with this. This actually sets down and is soft to the touch. Still dewey though. Idk this stuff is perfect. Drugstore makeup is so dumb expensive these days but this is worth it!!",

It feels like a light watery serum like application but with a lot of coverage. Doesn't empahsize my pores. \nI'm so glad I gave this a try, I was not expexting so much coverage. I wore it to Europe and it would not budge on long days. One tip is to use a sponge to smooth out any streaks your brush could leave. I set it with Kosas powder.",

My skin is medium, leaning warm, but my face is fair white as it won't visibly tan or burn in the summer. I don't really wear make up anymore, especially not foundation, and I tried to do self-tanners on my face but they either don't make a difference or fade within a day or two (shoutout to my good skincare) so I've been on the hunt to find a skin-tint that I can mix with my sunscreen or moisturized and wear for nights out or when I know there will be photos. I wore this for the first time last night at a concert to test it out. I didn't feel it on my skin at all, and it worked great. I don't have a lot of acne or texture anymore, but I do have some happiness wrinkles and this product didn't make them visible. I also went lighter towards the center of my face & could still see my freckles through which was what I wanted. It could easily give medium to medium-full coverage if you build it up. It lasted all night with no powder or other products on top. I only needed a few drops to cover my face and it blended well into my normal skintone. For reference, I picked up 220 and 312 because I wasn't sure which one I'd be right now, and the 312 was more of my summer shade, so I mixed a little of each to get the perfect color. The website won't let me post a picture but it looked great!",
