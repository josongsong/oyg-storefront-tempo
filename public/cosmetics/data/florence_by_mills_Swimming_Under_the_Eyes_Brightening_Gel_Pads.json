I know this line is meant for young girls who really don't require much skincare, but these weren't even moisturizing. I was surprised at how dry the masks are, even right out of the container.  they are also very very fragile. Whether I used the included little spatula or my fingers, the masks are very prone to tearing. Also I wish that the \"eyes\" were not still in the container because as you use the masks up you get left with these tiny little circle pieces everywhere from where the holes were cut out for the eyes. The good news is that I didn't have any irritation and didn't notice any bad fragrance.",

        "comments": "There wasn't much serum in mine (don't know how others have so much the pads slide down) and they aren't put in the jar in a way that allows them to be applied with the unexposed side down for both eyes, so I feel like there's even less on one of them. Unless you're not anal about them both facing the same way (E.G.: both whale tails on the outer edge of the eyes). \n\nI love the way they feel, though. I wasn't sure if they were soaking in/moisturizing but I fell asleep with them on once and they didn't budge. When I felt them afterwards they were definitely drier and less skin-like so they surely are plumped full of serum, and it goes to reason that being kept on the skin and air kept out would make them effective.  \n\nNo visible effects, personally, but I don't have any eye issues to try to fix. I'm still on the search for an exceptional eye mask, but I'll keep coming back to these if I try another brand I end up not liking.",

        "comments": "So I purchased this product to simply give it a try because I couldn't find the regular gel under eye pads. There is hardly any scent to this product. I gave it 1 stars because the gel pads slip down your face because they made these under eye gel pads to heavy or might be the serum it comes with. I wouldn't buy this product again. It's not a bright purple like the picture shows you. Its a deep dark purple. The wholes to the eye on the whales pops off. If your looking for style go ahead and purchase. But I wouldn't recommend this product. You can't walk around with these gel pads on your face. I'm a mother so im busy on a daily basis. I have to sit to wait the 10 mins to be finished with using this product so it doesn't slip off.",
