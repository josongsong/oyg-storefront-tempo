I am 63, with normal skin no dry patches, or oily areas, no acne either. I do have fine smile lines that are getting deeper as I age. And thats okay, part of life. I purchased shade 205 N, it's perfect. I have a fair-light neutral undertone. I use Holy Hydration products, plus Loreal age perfect serum for a primer, plus Whoa Glow in Sunbeam   and Loreal Glotion in fair. Hali glow did not go light enough or pink enough, but I have not tried 0.0 or 0.5 either.\nFor reference I love Revlon Illuminance in 117, Wet n Wild in Nude Ivory, Loreal True Match Lumi N 1-2. I set my under eyes and chin with Halo Glow powder in light pink. Then set with Elf dewy coconut setting spray. It last at least 10 hours. Thank you Elf",
