However, my boyfriend bought me some Kylie cosmetics for my birthday and it came with lip liner and gloss in a brown shade. I fell in love with it but something was missing. Pink. So one day I went out with my friend and we stopped by Ulta just for fun and then i saw the shade Poise K. I knew i had to have it. It was the best makeup decsion ive made in a long time. Ive gotten so many compliments and people asking what it was i will never not recommend.",

I landed on the harmony velvet lip kit. first time user and I will be repurchasing this set along with different shades. both the lip liner and lipstick gloss glides on lips for easy application. the lipstick locks on your lips and does not smug or get on your teeth. I've drank and ate food and the lipstick has not left my lips. last all day. both the liner and liquid lipstick pair very well together ❤️ 💋 💄 xoxo",
