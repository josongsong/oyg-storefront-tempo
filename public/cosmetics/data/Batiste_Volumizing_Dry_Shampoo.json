        "comments": "So let me say that this is the only dry shampoo I've ever used that truly does not require very much to get rid of the oily look. It also smells great and yes, it gives you volume. However, it leaves a definite residue and makes your hair hard to brush. I dont mind it because it requires so little and I even use less on consecutive days because its so good at getting rid of oil. and if you want your hair to stay a certain way, its pretty good for that. Overall, I'm buying this again and it may be my new go-to. Especially considering how little you need in comparison to others. Just be aware of the texture it gives.",

I was surprised and impressed with how much volume it gave me, like I have more hair than I really do! The formula reminds me of some volume powders I've tried (the kind that have that slight tackiness, if that makes sense) so if you use this one, you really have to make sure you hold the can far enough away as you spray the sections of hair because it doesn't take much.",

I've got long hair that's pretty fine - since it weighs itself down, it needs some help in the volume department. Unfortunately, this product was heavy and sticky. It added a ton of texture, but felt stiff, almost like there was clay in my hair. I couldn't wait to wash it out ... which pretty much defeats the purpose of dry shampoo. This product might be great for up dos, but not for wearing my hair down. I still like the original formula much better!",
