Keep in mind it was also white in color\n\nNow unfortunately Ive come across two bottles at Ulta that have been tan in color, greasy upon coming out of the bottle almost leaving an oiling liquid around cream, its a lot thinner in consistency and leaves my face looking as if i have bacon grease on instead of moisturizer. Tends to just sit in skin ans foesnt make for easy aoplication of makeup on top. Both times they have exchanged them out for me but just yesterday they swapped one for the other and its still the same thing. Checked with the company and they said the formula didnt change so does ulta just shelf old product? I love Ulta and the variety but this is a huge bummer. She also wouldnt let me test out the others because she said shed then have to defect them all….",

        "comments": "I have incredibly oily, acne prone skin that is also quite sensitive. I've heard such great things about this, and know so many people love it. Unfortunately, it's not for me. Any time I wore it, it made my skin tingle, so I think I must have some sort of allergy to something in it. It made many of my foundations sit weird, and didn't play well with a lot of my other skincare products. I had the same issue with their eye cream. I really wanted to love this one, because it did help with oil control!! The finish is pretty similar to the Clinique Moisture Surge and the Neutrogena HydroBoost (before it was reformulated), so I was hoping it could be one that would fit in with those. I got thorugh 1/4 of the container, really gave it a good go, and decided it wasn't for me. I typically will use moisturizers that I decide don't work for my face on my body, just to get all those great skin benefits. And I can say it felt amazing on my body!! I do also love that there aren't any dyes or fragrance in this, as those are common irritants for my skin.",

This seems to be the right routine for me because in less than a week my skin is more even toned and clear. I went out with only concealer and mascara on and one of my friends asked me what foundation I was using even though I had none on. The right skin care routine is life changing. Thank you FAB!",

However, after nearly a year of using the product, I noticed with a purchase around Christmas time that the moisturizer wasn't the same. It did not smell the same, it stings my face, it's a totally different texture on the skin... a look at the ingredients and comparing to an old bottle... they removed ceramides from the formula and replaced with heavier, denser ingredients! I loved this product for its hydration and restoration. Now it stings my skin and doesn't hydrate the same.",
