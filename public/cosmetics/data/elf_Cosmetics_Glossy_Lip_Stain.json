You get what you pay for, i suppose. In this economy, that isnt good enough for me. Three stars because it is pretty while it lasts.",

It has a very cooling, silky formula. It's long lasting too! Combine this product with their love triangle lip filler liners for intensity.  This is a must have in your collection.",

        "comments": "I got two colors to try out - \"Power Mauves\" & \"Basic Beige\", they were both orange on my lips with Power Mauves being a darker orange and Basic Beige a lighter orange - not the colors I was expecting to get for the selection of the names I chose. On top of this, I felt like instead of a \"lip stain\" these are definitely more like a glossy lip OIL, unscented, very lightweight with a tint of color but not really moisturizing and although the gloss finish is pretty and not sticky (especially for those who love more natural looks) it did not have much lasting power on the lips. After eating a sandwich or drinking some water I would look in the mirror and notice that the product was almost completely gone from my lips with uneven patches of color randomly left on some parts of my lips which I guess was supposed to be the \"stain\" part of this product. It was so unsightly that the only way to fix it was either to take it all off or reapply an entire coat on my lips again which I constantly had to keep doing during the day. If you don't mind a glossy lip oil which you have to reapply constantly during the day then by all means go for it. Unfortunately, this was just not for me.",
