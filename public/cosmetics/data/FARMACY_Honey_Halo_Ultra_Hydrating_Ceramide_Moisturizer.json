But every time I use it, I get pimples and visibly clogged pores the next day. I'll use it once, stop for a few weeks, then try again, and the same thing happens every time. I can't figure out what ingredient(s) is causing the problem, as none of them stand out as typical pore-cloggers. So disappointed. Beware if you are at all acne-prone.",

It gives all day hydration, and it even wears well under makeup. I've also had less acne flares since incorporating this product into my routine.

The original was so sticky and difficult to apply whereas this one is an actual lotion that applies easily and smoothly. The scent is lightly of honey, and the application feels a bit sticky to the touch afterwards, but not in a bad way. My skin definitely feels hydrated after applying it, and a little goes a long way. I do feel it is on the richer side though, so I'm not able to use this daily with my oily skin type.",

But unfortuantely my skin type didn't react well over time. I have extremely sensitive skin and I also have PCOS so when I went through the first week I started getting a rash just along my smile lines to my nose. I thought maybe it'd clear up the more I got used to it but it got worse. It eventually turned into acne and super dry and patchy where it reacted. Once I stopped using it and went back to my old mousturizer it cleared up. \nI know it works for a lot of people but for those that might have super sensitive skin or PCOS, keep in mind it might create a reaction. Otherwise in the areas that didn't get affected it is super moistizing and smells great. I wish my skin type didn't react so badly, otherwise I'd say it's a great product.",

This is particularly important during the winter months when my skin tends to become drier, yet I still need to be cautious of products that can make it greasy throughout the day. This cream has been a fantastic solution. It's truly a game-changer! With a delightful honey scent, it absorbs wonderfully and keeps my skin hydrated and radiant without any greasy residue. What sets this cream apart from others is its deep moisturizing properties. In the summer, it might feel a bit heavy for my skin type, but I notice that my skin's needs shift with the changing seasons. Another major plus is that this lotion doesn't pill, which has been a significant issue for me in the past. It layers beautifully under makeup, although I primarily use it as my night cream or on days when I'm keeping my makeup minimal. The jar's design is incredibly smart, featuring a magnetized applicator and lid that stay together, so you won't have to search for the little stick or keep everything in the original box to avoid losing it.  Complimentary from farmacybeauty.",

But unfortuantely my skin type didn't react well over time. I have extremely sensitive skin and I also have PCOS so when I went through the first week I started getting a rash just along my smile lines to my nose. I thought maybe it'd clear up the more I got used to it but it got worse. It eventually turned into acne and super dry and patchy where it reacted. Once I stopped using it and went back to my old mousturizer it cleared up. \nI know it works for a lot of people but for those that might have super sensitive skin or PCOS, keep in mind it might create a reaction. Otherwise in the areas that didn't get affected it is super moistizing and smells great. I wish my skin type didn't react so badly, otherwise I'd say it's a great product.",
