I'm a teacher and I talk all day and drink liquid all day and this really lasted. I used it with a Mac lipstick and Fenty lip gloss.

I'm so glad they are pencils, making sharpening so much easier. They are creamy and don't feel dry. In terms of wear, they are VERY long wearing, even after eating and drinking, but they aren't necessarily transfer-proof, but that could be because I wear them with gloss. I wore them once without powdering my lips and once with powdering them, and the base formula + powdering the lip liners = insane longevity; it actually took a bit of elbow grease to remove. Overall, if you want a long-wearing lip liner that lasts hours, even after eating or drinking, I think these are a safe bet.",
