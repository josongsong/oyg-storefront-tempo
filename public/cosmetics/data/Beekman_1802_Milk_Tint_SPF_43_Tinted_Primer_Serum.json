This is best suited for dry skin or people who live it dry climates. if you have oily skin or live in humid weather regions. This is a no go, unless you are going for that makeup no makeup look but even then you will have yo really set it because your face will turn into a grease pan, especially if you are wearing makeup. Your face will melt. Its light like a super moisturizer but acts like a foundation, its weird. Highly recommend applying with a sponge or using a sponge to remove excess before taking off. Again I like it but can't wear it on the day to day.",

I've tried tinted moisturizer from another brand and it's just ok but this Beekman Milk Tint is exactly what I have been looking for. It rubs in smooth and gives just the right amount of coverage, giving me a polished natural look. I don't wear any makeup over it. I do think it looks better when my skin is exfoliated and well moisturized so I'm not sure how I will like during midwest winters but at least it's a great summer option.",

I've been using it as a tinted moisturizer and because I have rosacea the zinc from the spf helps with my redness, but as soon as it goes on my clean dry face it separates and i've never even had lower quality brands do that. I'm a makeup artist and have used plenty of primers/tinted moisturizers/foundations and this takes the cake for the worst one. I'm just not really sure what they were going for here. Trying to blend any cream/liquid products on top such as concealer or blush creates a patchy, separated mess as well. And putting powder on top somehow makes it even worse. Save your money and try something else!",

I have mature dry skin so I always look for skincare that will plump, hydrate and feed my skin. I wear sunscreen every day no matter the weather or circumstance. This broad spectrum Milk Tint\nSPF 43 Tinted Primer Serum is wonderful. I was going to return it but decided to give it one more try after a disastrous first use. First go round I took the entire 1/4 teaspoon advised for full sunscreen efficacy and applied all of it to my face. That was an absolute mistake on my part. The Milk Tint welled up in every fine line, would not dry down and felt oddly heavy on my skin. The second time I used it I took the same 1/4 teaspoon and applied in a thin layer which my skin absorbed readily. I let that dry down for 15 minutes. I then applied a second layer which finished up the rest of the 1/4 teaspoon amount and again the product absorbed and dried down to a glowy, dewy and lit from within finish. I threw on a bit of concealer here and there and was good to go. In conclusion, I adore the Milk Tint, will repurchase and am really happy I took a minute to learn how this product needs to be applied.",

        "comments": "I typically very much love beekman, but this product was not it. I have no idea how it could even be considered as a primer, but even on its own it's a very poor product. I've been using it as a tinted moisturizer and because I have rosacea the zinc from the spf helps with my redness, but as soon as it goes on my clean dry face it separates and i've never even had lower quality brands do that. I'm a makeup artist and have used plenty of primers/tinted moisturizers/foundations and this takes the cake for the worst one. I'm just not really sure what they were going for here. Trying to blend any cream/liquid products on top such as concealer or blush creates a patchy, separated mess as well. And putting powder on top somehow makes it even worse. Save your money and try something else!",
