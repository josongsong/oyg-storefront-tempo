I have used the face base up to and around my eyes over my own eye moisturizer....better results.\n The extra step, the extra $, creasing and less moisturizing gives it a 3....may yield better results on someone younger and/or that follows up with BB foundation.",

But not sure what could really help 2 hours of sleep besides MORE SLEEP (…and possibly not getting kicked by a 5 year old all night who wakes up running and jumping onto your bed after you've only slept an hour or two but he tosses and turns all night keeping you from falling into a deep sleep.) Anyways, it keeps my eye area looking more fresh than cakey when I'm layering on the products to hide my genetic-plus lack of sleep-dark circles. My under eyes are so sensitive to eye creams. Out of all of the jars and tubes of eye creams I have in my cabinet, only a few do not cause red bumps under my eyes. This is one of those that do not cause red bumps. It's quite amazing that it doesn't, considering it's a \"primer\" - I was sure it wouldn't work out for me. But I had tried a tiny jar of it awhile back and knew I needed to buy the full size, and I'm very happy that I did. I do use this over my eye cream after that soaks in. Foundation and/or concealer looks nice over it and doesn't do anything weird like separating the makeup. It keeps my under eyes from looking too dry, as I have super dry under eyes when left without products. It's quite creamy, almost a liquid-like cream, and a pale custard-cream shade. The jar itself is very nice quality, a little weight to it, with thick plastic (?) and their signature lid. I dropped it once and it didn't break! I think it's worth it, if you have super dry under eyes like me and need more than just a layer of eye cream to keep makeup looking good over it…it's definitely worth trying at least!",
