After hearing how beloved this mascara is by almost everyone I hoped it would work miracles, but unfortunately it doesn't. As soon as I apply it, my lashes get weighed down and start to sink and lose their curl. Although the mascara does add volume and length, I find that it tends to clump up and make my lashes stick together. It also stays wet for quite a while and has a tendency to smudge and flake on me. In the end it basically netted out to just an average mascara for me. Granted my lashes are difficult to work with but I figured this review would be helpful for those with similar issues.",
