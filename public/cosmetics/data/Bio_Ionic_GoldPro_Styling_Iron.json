She was shocked and for the first time with her doing my hair for over twenty years had never seen my hair damaged. I had bought this flat iron because you promote it's better and less damaging. I also bought your gold pro dryer and it is no better. I am now unable to use any color on my roots over 4 months because of the damage and I'm still having to grow my hair. May take me over a year or more. I'm miserable.",
