Definitely not worth the price; there are a lot of great moisturizers for the eye area out there at half or a quarter the price that do so much more thab just hydrate.",

Took over three weeks to see somewhat normality return to under my eyes, though they still have not recovered the elasticity back..  I am so disappointed on how bad this made under my eyes look.",

I received a sample with a previous order and decided to try it out. I was very surprised the next morning. The bags under my eyes were less puffy. My laugh lines were less apparent. Even my top eyelid looked \"tighter\". I definitely looked more awake. I used every drop of that sample and, when the website had a sale, I ordered a full size. It is expensive considering the size of the bottle, but you only need to use a little of the product. The product also suggests using it AM and PM, but I only use it at night to extend the life of my bottle. Even using it once a day, I have seen results. This is the REAL DEAL!",

My skin is sensitive, combination, and at 43 I have anti-aging concerns . I have happily used the Firming Serum for over a year and I was excited to try the Firming Eye Cream. I put it on after my normal KS skincare routine and the next morning my eyes were swollen and red. Eventually that became red and dry and peeling. From ONE application!!! Not sure if I got a bad batch but I will never use this again. (Which is horrible considering the money I paid for it.) A week later and I'm still trying to reduce the puffiness and skin peeling around my eyes.",
