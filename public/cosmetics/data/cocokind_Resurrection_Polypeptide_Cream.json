        "comments": "I love cocokind so it saddens me to make this review but this moisturizer was deeply disappointing. The first time I purchased it, the package was already opened with a weird goopy consistency and there was crust all over the sides and the lid, so I thought it had gone bad, I returned it and got a new sealed one, just to open it to find the same paint like consistency and crust formed around the top of the lid. I've used it a few more times to give it a fair shot, but the packaging is so messy and the moisturizer itself feels like I'm rubbing paint all over my face and took so long to absorb. once absorbed, my skin didn't feel or look moisturized. So bummed but I'll just stick to the cocokind products I know work.",

        "comments": "I was expecting a rich cream so I was disappointed to find the cream is rather thin. It looks and feels a lot like wall paint. I find the scent unpleasant although it doesn't linger on the skin so its a temporary annoyance. It feels like applying paint to my skin but it does rub in well. It sets down to a non-shiny finish. It is good for daytime under make up or at night before bed. I find it moderately hydrating, but my skin is pretty dry. This just isn't enough for me. I wouldn't repurchase....I just can't get past the texture and scent.",

I am a skin care junkie, although a clean formula must haver because i am skin sensitive and have extreme sensitivities. I tend toward high end brands but i always, always come back to cocokind and the ressurection cream is hands down the only rivh cream i bother to buy after trying a lot of other high end clean beauty brands. That's it, that's the bottom line. This is my holy grail. There's some other things that perform just as well but they do not have the volume or price. There's just no reason to iverspend when this is EVERYTHING. I can agree the texture is incredibly thick but also, i think if you are using wo much that the tecture is bothering you or it won't absorb, you are using tooooo much. It doesn't take a lot! I used this year round, but especially in the winter.",

This girl is THICC. she has an odd texture kinda like paint but not as runny. It's not sticky.  \n\nfor the price point, I'm really impressed. used it almost two hours ago. About6 hours ago on my hands and no issues. They're soft. It doesn't feel greasy or sticky. It's a very thick Moisturizer so could see how some would find it sticky /too rich. It goes on beautifully with a bit of a matte finish vs a shiny finish like the Tatcha. My face is fully absorbed. It feels soft, no residue. I can't speak to any longterm benefits yet. don't think it's going to be what wanted to replace the Tatcha, but can see using this long term in rotation with Tatcha so that I'm not spending a ton on that.",

        "comments": "I did not purchase this product, nor did I really seek something like this out, I got it as a free gift for buying smoother products from this brand. Now I'm seeing some arguments about the texture, mine was left outside in freezing weather for a few when delivered, so I don't know if that affected the texture, but this is like a marshmallow fluff texture to me. It is also a dark lilac purple color, which I think is fun. It's very thick and takes some hand warmth to spread over the skin. It also dries matte, so you don't look greasy. This is a VERY thick cream, heavy on the skin, which is good for those with very dry skin. I put this on at night once a week and my face is so moisturized, deep into my skin too not just on the surface, and makes my skin look very plump like I got a collagen infusion. I also love the clean ingredients, this brand is so eco friendly I can't help but applaud. I do have very young skin, hence why I didn't really seek it out, but I have it so I might as well use it, so I can't say much about its efforts against wrinkles, but it would be hard for me to believe that this does nothing for them!",

        "comments": "I thought this was going to be similar to Belif's Moisturizing Bomb (a favorite of mjne but I find my makeup does not lay well over the Belif product), but the texture is drastically different. The Cocokind moisturizer has a bouncy texture similar to a jelly. Yet when applied to the skin, it feels like a cool, delightful cream. As the warmth of fingers melts the product, it becomes thinner and your skin feels like you've applied a fancy, thick oil. When it absorbs more into your skin, your skin is still left looking a glowy look, but it becomes slightly velvety to the touch. Its rather unique to me, and I actually really like it. My skin looks plump and stays hydrated all day. \n\nI do have two cons, but I feel they are rather minor. The first being the packaging, in that I wish it was nicer. But you can simply put the product in a mini-fridge or hide it away in a cabinet to keep it away from shower steam, general humidity, or sunlight. The other con is that it takes a while for my skin to absorb the product, and during this phase, it leaves my face slightly sticky. While this is great when I wear makeup for it acts like a slightly-tacky primer, I find some sunscreens - particularly Zinc sunscreens - to be rather difficult to blend and even get some pilling along my jawline with Zinc sunscreens. When I use hybrid or chemical sunscreens, there is no problem.\n\nOverall, very happy with the product. It was not what I thought it was going to be. However, it definitely keeps my dry, sensitive, eczema-prone skin hydrated all day, makes my makeup last slightly longer, and I like its unique texture. I would definitely repurchase this again.",
