The first few times I used it, it was great, but as I kept on using it the product was making my face red and irritated each time I applied.

I have Rosacea and haved used this product for the past 6 months and can't say enough wonderful things about it. It has reduced the redness, has not made my face feel tight or caused a burning sensation. I LOVE it! I use this in conjunction with the Redness Solution Daily Relief Cream. It is a great combination for my skin. I tell anyone who will stand still long enough about how wonderful these two products are -- even my husband has noticed the difference!! And that is amazing! Thank you for the great products you provide.",

Actually, our skin needs a higher level of cleansing at night to remove not only makeup and sunscreens, but also perspiration, pollution, soil and excess oil than you need in the morning when we need a lighter level of cleansing. So for the cleanest skin possible and to allow your Redness Solutions Cleanser to effectively cleanse the skin, it's best to use a makeup solvent to break down the makeup and sun block first.\"\n\n\"It cleanses the skin of the perspiration, pollution and excess oil that is on the skin during the day but with the long wearing makeup technology available, you need a makeup solvent at night first to help remove it. For one product to provide the same level of cleansing both morning and night could cause over cleansing of the skin which can lead to irritation.\"\n\nSO for those of you wondering why you cant get your foundation off... this isn't designed for make up remover at all.\n\nHope this is helpful!!",
