        "comments": "I'd started investing in facials as I have hormonal acne and nearing the end of my 20s - the hope being my breakouts would resolve before any wrinkles started! My skin had always been inconsistent; sometimes it was fairly clear and other times I had mild acne. My forehead in particular had become very congested and nothing I used seemed to have an effect (AHA/BHA acids). The treatments were helping immediately after but my skin became congested again in the interim between appointments. My facialist suggested using a toner to help exfoliate my combination skin, something I hadn't used for years due to the ingredients always being too astringent. After a little trial and error, I came across this toner, researched PHAs and decided to purchase it. Within a week, my congested skin had transformed! The breakouts were clearing, healing and I had virtually no texture on my forehead. The tone had evened out and my skin was a lot less angry. For anyone who struggles with the balance of products that are strong enough to have an effect but gentle on reactive skin, this may be just what you're looking for!",

        "comments": "I think I might be sensitive to niacinamide and this one has 3% niacinamide. I liked that this is the first chemical exfoliant that my skin can tolerate without compromising my skins barrier, but I started noticing some dry flakey redness on my cheeks while using this, I tried cut it out, thinking I was overdoing it and it got better, but then when I stated using it again even just once a week the red dry patches came back. I ended up having to try and isolate what was going on and figured out that my skin doesn't like niacinamide. Funnily enough I specifically decided to try this one because it had a safe low level of niacinamide, but I think it was still too much for me. I'm using a niacinamide free pha now and it does nice things for my skin, so if your skin likes niacinamide this might be a great product for you.",
