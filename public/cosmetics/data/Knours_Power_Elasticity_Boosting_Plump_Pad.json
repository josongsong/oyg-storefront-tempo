I redid my routine and started drinking a lot more water and my skin is like someone else's. Spent years with stuff pilling and not working, applying moisturizer 3x a day and still dry. I wake up with moisturized skin now but I have a many step routine now but less than before. I think this helps a lot. Do with this info what you want. Lol.",

I use one sheet directly after I wash my face and I use two sheets if my face is feeling really dry (but one sheet is usually enough) then I follow it with a toner and moisturizer. It leaves my skin glowing and plump I tell you!! I could notice a difference after about a week of using it every night. The best part it didn't break my sensitive skin out. Get it right now if you want glowing moisturized and plump skin.",

This pad contains plant extracts designed to improve skin elasticity and reduce fine lines. After cleansing, I applied the pad and left it on for about 5 minutes, and I could feel my skin becoming more hydrated and smooth almost immediately.  The pad feels very gentle on the skin, so it didn't cause any irritation, even on sensitive areas. While I haven't noticed significant changes in elasticity just yet, my skin does feel softer and more nourished after each use.  Overall, it's an easy-to-use product that provides a nice boost of hydration and firmness, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to improve their skincare routine.",
