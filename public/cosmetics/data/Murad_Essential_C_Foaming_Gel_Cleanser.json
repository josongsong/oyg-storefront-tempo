At one point in my life, earlier this year, I decided to stop woth my regular cleaning program and deeply regret it. I had horrible cyctic acne and acne scars just below my cheekbones; I used that cleanser, The Ordinary niacinamid, hyloronic acid, and salicylic acid (in that order of application) with the CEO vitamin c hydration cream after and they're gone after two months. I get the occasional hormonal breakouts but it kills them like a champ. Every other or three days I wash my face. Best combo in the world hands down.",

        "comments": "I have been using the travel size once, sometimes twice, a day, and now that I've used up the tube, here is my review.\nTHE GOOD:  The smell is divine, like the bright morning sunshine. I seriously look forward to it. My skin feels great after washing, never tight or dry.\nTHE BAD: It doesn't remove makeup very well. I don't wear a ton, I use makeup remover around my eyes beforehand, but when using a toner after washing there is still a lot of makeup that is left on the cotton ball. So, I would recommend a double cleanse when removing makeup for the day. I also did not see any difference in the advertised brightening effect. But, as I mentioned, I only have used the travel size, so if it takes more than that amount to see brightening, you'll have to get the bigger size. I know Vitamin C takes a while to lighten dark spots, so I just can't say if this cleanser works for that or not. \nTHE UGLY:  The price for what you get.  I bought this during a B1G1 mini size sale to try it out. Based on what I've experienced, I would never pay full price for this product. I would definitely use it again as a morning cleanser if the price was right, but I think there are cheaper options out there that are just as good.",

I have brown spots on my face from my pregnancy, and this product really did fade them, and even out my complexion. I saw a difference in one week of using it. I read the comments of the women who gave bad reviews, and I might suggest they were using the wrong line for their skin type rather than it's a faulty product. It took me years to learn my skin type because I am combination skin which lead to sensitive skin. So many products either broke me out, or dried me out. Because I had combination skin that broke out easily from using the wrong product, I thought I had acne prone skin, and used products designed to dry out acne, and was really drying out and damaging my skin, but then when I tried to treat my dry complexion with moisturizers, I was over moisturizing, and creating break outs.It took going to a spa, and learning from an esthetician which products to use rather than a sales lady. It also took trial and error. So for potential buyers need to learn their actual skin type, and not skin problems. Using the wrong line will only worsen your problems. The only con I give this product is affordability. It is a consumable product which means it is a reoccurring cost. The price is too high for most of the population under 40.",

I found that it dried out my skin to the point of giving it a tight, flaky appearance. Also, I use an eye makeup remover beforehand but a little mascara is always left. This Murad facewash does not remove those leftover bits of mascara. I used this facewash for as least six months (it lasts a long time) and feel it does not do anything it claims to do, including \"neutralizing environmental aggressors\" (what does that mean anyway?), and it certainly didn't moisturize. On a minor note, the cap was poorly designed. Water always gets in it and oftentimes too much product comes out when you squeeze it. This facewash performs so poorly I won't ever try another Murad facewash. Price is outrageous for how badly it dried out my face when it claims to moisturize.",
