The applicator is the WORST. it won't grab product - even if I store it upside down (guess the formula is too thick to move) and you can't circle the wand around the sides because of the plastic insert. So I popped the insert out, depotted them in an attempt to make it work, and they dried up in days. This has to be one of the WORST vessel designs I have ever encountered. You can see in my photo the applicator is nearly clean. Super frustrating.",

I dont have sensitive skin and dont normally have reactions to make up but this makes me eyelids swell and itch so bad. The packaging is also terrible. You barely get any product and I think after a few weeks of daily use, you wouldnt be able to scrape anymore product out. I still would recommend because not everyone will have a reaction and its great if you want to use it sometimes so itll last!",

        "comments": "The makeup quality is usually very good, it is fast driving so you have to move fast. It does last all with no smudging and minimal to no creasing (provided you don't also have oil based products layered with it). However, I did get one bottle that came with loose \"hairs\" possibly from a faulty made wand(I threw it away to be safe).\nSome of the colors are spot on with what's represented on the packaging. However, there are a few such as \"Tin Pan Alley\" that do not match. with that color. I was expecting a pale gold color but what I got was still pale but it had a lot of green.\nUnfortunately the packaging is very wasteful, and I'm not talking about all the plastic boxes but rather that unless you cut it open, you won't be able to access most of the makeup. \nQuantity, they do not regulate consistent amounts. Most of the eye paints I purchased years ago had much more product. But also of the ones I recently purchased together, one had significantly less product.",

If I wrote this review when I first got this, I would easily give it 5-stars, but it's been 10 months later and with only using it a handful of times, it is completely dried out.  I cannot get any product using the applicator.  I was able to smush and smear what was on the applicator to my finger to apply whatever was left on there, but cannot get anything else.  It was screwed on securely and I have never had this issue with any other brand's similar product.  Maybe it's the packaging, but I'm disappointed I didn't get to use this more than a handful of times.",

        "comments": "My god Ms. Frangipane (& team) you've really done it this time! This was my first about-face order, I was super excited to try! I had heard that these products were great quality especially at the price point and those reviews were NOT lying! I tried this fractal glitter eye paint (apollo) in-store at ulta just to check color and consistency and while the tester was a little bit dried out it still blended out beautifully on the back of my hand and the shimmer was breathtaking, not to mention I absolutely loved the color! I immediately had to order it! The product will seem dry-ish when it comes out but trust me, it's not! In terms of wear on the eyes, I'd say this blends out best using your fingertips as opposed to a brush (though that may just be me), and it has fantastic stay power! I tend to have particularly oily eyelids in combination with hooded eyes so if you're like me I'd recommend using a tacky primer base for your eye makeup and a good setting spray, but otherwise this is a 100/10 product for me!! The only real downside to this is the packaging, you can't see how much is left and I don't think that the doe-foot applicator is necessarily the best for picking up and depositing the product given its consistency, but again I absolutely love this product otherwise and I'll recommend it to anyone who will listen!! THANK YOU HALSEY & TEAM",

        "comments": "Look…I have LOTS of AF products and I'm a huge fan. The old packaging was cumbersome to store and bulky, but the applicator was superior to this one. I've had to return two different shades because the applicator and this formula doesn't jive well. I'm not sure why. It's the same packaging as the matte fluid eye paint and lip paint, but it's more of a doe foot shaped tip. The prior packaging was able to get plenty of product on the wand, however, the revamp has a hard time getting plenty of product out of the package. Thus, you're not able to fully experience the genius of this product because you're too busy fumbling around with the applicator trying to get it covered with product. If you can get your hands on the older packaging, you'll really experience what this product can do. \n\nNow that that's out of the way, I have nearly every shade in both the old and new packaging. The formula is a gorgeous \"whipped mousse\" lightweight gel-like feel with very finely milled glitter with pigment mixed in. You can't go wrong with Above Santorini, a gorgeous jewel toned deep teal blue with teal and blue glitter. However, if you're more of a neutral fan, you'll dig shades like fracture and digital demise. There's a beautiful soft silver in this collection and the gold is stunning as well. All the shades are really beautiful and unique. Once this product sets, it's not going anywhere until you take it off. No flaking, fading, cracking, etc etc. I just wish the new applicator delivered the product as well as its former version.",
