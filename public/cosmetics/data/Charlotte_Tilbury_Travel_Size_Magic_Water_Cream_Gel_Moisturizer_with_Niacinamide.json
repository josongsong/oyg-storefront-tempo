I live in arid dry cold Colorado and this cream is very viscous - like elmers glue! It remains on the skin hours later, sealing in plumping moisture, but NOT occlusive. Great ingredients list, zero fragrance, and wears well under tinted SPF. High shine though - so I use a setting powder over it in some places. Not causing break outs, and lessens the appearance of fine lines.",

Especially when my forehead can get closed comedones and breakouts easily. I took a gamble and bought the mini and fell in loveee!!! I am so dry in some areas i often peel, so i was prepared to give this away or return (i cant do gel or gel creams becuase of my dry skin). But i was so shocked at how hydrating this is and it make my skin so shiny and glowy and layers so beautifully under makeup. As a sensitive skin girly too, fragrance free is so important to me as fragrances can be irritating. Also, CT is certified cruelty free by leaping bunny, as a girl who lovess animals and only shops cruelty free, so important! Ive since bought the water cream set with the full size and mini that's on the way and I can't wait! Just try it!",

        "headline": "A Nice Treat",
        "comments": "This is such a treat for my skin. It offers hydration without that heavy feel, and it's packed with ingredients like niacinamide and peptides, both important in my routine. Niacinamide is known for smoothing skin texture, brightening, and minimizing pores. The peptides are great for a little boost in elasticity and helps skin stay resilient, which I'm never opposed to. It also has hyaluronic acid and polyglutamic acid, a duo I love because it locks in hydration. I want to note that it's made without oils and is water based, which is a huge bonus if you're like me and tend to get that midday shine. The texture is light but still feels luxurious. It also layers really well under makeup without pilling. This cream is quite spendy, you're looking at about $30 for the travel size. Although I like this cream and its ingredients, there are other moisturizers out there that create the same result but at a more affordable price. If you have some extra money to spend and want to splurge on a luxurious cream, I'd say go for it. In my opinion it's lovely, but not a \"must have\".",

        "comments": "Okay, so I've been using this new Charlotte Tilbury moisturizer called Magic Water Cream, and it's the real deal. I have dry, sensitive skin, and this stuff is a lifesaver.\nAt first, I was like, \"No way, this is too light,\" but it's super hydrating. It's like a drink of water for my skin, but without the feeling of greasy residue. I use it with the Magic Serum Crystal Elixir, and my skin feels like a dream. My redness is way down, and my skin texture is smoother than ever. Plus, it doesn't make my T-zone oily, which is a huge win.\nI've tried a ton of moisturizers, but this one is the best. It's gentle enough for sensitive skin, but it still provides the hydration my skin needs. And the best part? It doesn't have a strong fragrance, which can be irritating for those of us with sensitive skin.\nOne thing I really appreciate about Magic Water Cream is that it helps my makeup apply more smoothly. My foundation looks flawless, and my pores appear smaller. I used to struggle with redness and uneven skin tone, but this moisturizer has made a significant difference.\nThe packaging is also a plus. The glass jar is elegant and feels luxurious, and the lid is easy to twist off and on. While it might not be the most eco-friendly option, it's a small price to pay for such a great product.\nI've been using Magic Water Cream for a few weeks now, and I've already noticed a noticeable improvement in my skin. My complexion is brighter, my skin is less reactive, and my overall skin health has improved. I used to wake up with dry, flaky patches, but now my skin feels hydrated and plump.\nI've even noticed a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. My skin looks more youthful and radiant. I love how this moisturizer leaves my skin feeling soft and supple all day long.\nIn addition to the benefits I've already mentioned, Magic Water Cream also offers a few other perks. For example, it's suitable for all skin types, including oily and combination skin. While it's specifically marketed for acne-prone skin,I've found that it doesn't exacerbate my breakouts at all.\nAnother thing I like about this moisturizer is that it's a little goes a long way. A small amount is all you need to hydrate and nourish your skin. I apply it twice a day, morning and night, and I've noticed that my skin is less sensitive to environmental factors like pollution and temperature changes.\nIf you're using Magic Water Cream for the first time, I recommend starting with a small amount and gradually increasing it as needed. It's important to listen to your skin and adjust your skincare routine accordingly.\nOverall, I'm extremely impressed with Magic Water Cream. It's a high-quality moisturizer that delivers on its promises.If you're looking for a product that will hydrate, soothe, and improve the overall health of your skin, I highly recommend giving it a try.",

        "comments": "Was excited to try this because I LOVE water and gel moisturizers when they work as promised. Unfortunately when I opened the jar this didn't really look like a water cream and is a thicker consistency that looks only slightly thinner than the OG Magic Cream, so that disappointed me but I still tried it in a few ways. \n\nI layer a few serums in my skincare routine and during the day I typically can't use more than a water cream otherwise my face is left too oily/dewy. I used this after the Magic Serum and a niacinimide and ceramide serum and typically my skin has a bit of a glow but this left it incredibly shiny/oily looking, almost like the cream has some mica in it. I had to powder my face even after using my mattifying SPF which typically isn't something I need to do. \n\nI did try this cream on its own and my skin did absorb it better, but it took a solid 30 minutes. I found it worked great under makeup as a first step before primer and my foundation looked great! But for daily skincare needs this doesn't have enough benefits for me to use with nothing else, so I can't really justify the price or plan to purchase this in the future. If you have drier skin this may be helpful for you though.",
